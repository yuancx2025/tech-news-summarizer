A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

But for some users, last Thursday’s release felt more like a wrenching downgrade, with the new ChatGPT presenting a diluted personality and making surprisingly dumb mistakes.\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to X to say the company would keep the previous model, GPT-4o, running for Plus users. A new feature designed to seamlessly switch between models depending on the complexity of the query had broken on Thursday, Altman said, “and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber.” He promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5’s performance and the overall user experience.\n\nGiven the hype around GPT-5, some level of disappointment appears inevitable. When OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March 2023, it stunned AI experts with its incredible abilities. GPT-5, pundits speculated, would surely be just as jaw-dropping.\n\nOpenAI touted the model as a significant upgrade, with PhD-level intelligence and virtuoso coding skills. A system to automatically route queries to different models was meant to provide a smoother user experience. (It could also save the company money by directing simple queries to cheaper models.)\n\nSoon after GPT-5 dropped, however, a Reddit community dedicated to ChatGPT filled with complaints. Many users mourned the loss of the old model.\n\n“I’ve been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same. It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.”\n\n“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.\n\nOther threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.\n\nAltman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”\n\nErrors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former OpenAI employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nThe backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.\n\nIn March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.\n\n“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more “business” and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”\n\nAltman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.\n\n“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn’t describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"revolt\", \"openai\", \"models\", \"chatgpt\", \"model\", \"update\", \"users\", \"gpt5\", \"company\", \"x\", \"scrambles\", \"user\", \"wrote\"]", "content_hash": "e46de1702c018f81047357130c6805c97ca84212726d0b59b1755e99a05acee1"}

Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance.\n\nBut a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it's a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist.\n\nPalantir has tried to correct the record itself in a series of blog posts with titles like “Palantir Is Not a Data Company” and “Palantir Is Still Not a Data Company.” In the latter, Palantir explains that “misconceptions can arise because our products are complicated,” but nonetheless, “it is absolutely possible” to accurately describe them to “people who are curious.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It's really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it's hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?”\n\nXia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is.\n\nIt’s not that former employees literally don’t know what Palantir is selling. In interviews with WIRED, they spoke fluidly about how its software can connect and transform different kinds of data collected by government agencies and corporations. But when asked to, say, name its direct business competitors, two former Palantir employees who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, struggled to come up with anything. “I still don't know how to answer that question, to be honest,” says one.\n\nJuan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS.

This July, he presented new evidence to the Goldschmidt Conference in Prague that the carbon in question is only between 2.7–2.8 billion years old, making it younger than other traces of life found elsewhere.\n\nOrganic carbon?\n\nThe carbon in question is in rock in Labrador, Canada. The rock was originally silt on the seafloor that, it's argued, hosted early microbial life that was buried by more silt, leaving the carbon as their remains. The pressure and heat of deep burial and tectonic events over eons have transformed the silt into a hard metamorphic rock, and the microbial carbon in it has metamorphosed into graphite.\n\n“They are very tiny, little graphite bits,” said Whitehouse.\n\nThe key to showing that this graphite was originally biological versus geological is its carbon isotope ratio. From life’s earliest days, its enzymes have preferred the slightly lighter isotope carbon-12 over the marginally heavier carbon-13. Organic carbon is therefore much richer in carbon-12 than geological carbon, and the Labrador graphite does indeed have this “light” biological isotope signature.\n\nThe key question, however, is its true age.\n\nMixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up rocks\n\nSorting out the age of the carbon-containing Labrador rock is a geological can of worms.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"old\", \"isotope\", \"earth\", \"question\", \"trace\", \"earliest\", \"geological\", \"biological\", \"carbon\", \"rock\", \"life\", \"graphite\", \"silt\", \"labrador\"]", "content_hash": "018cee9f7063d0e9a778e3af9466eb90fe0141c35034d1117d4b1d93e6187d04"}

Regulatory bodies need to keep up by rolling out tighter regulations aimed at strengthening consumer protections and stabilising the market.\n\nAs EU lawmakers scramble to protect consumers, others worry they are smothering growth. Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty. The regulatory bodies are defending the public, but had restrictions been lighter, would HSBC have had more creative solutions for its customers, such as embedding personalised, data-first lending?\n\nBanks have been fearful of exploring innovative embedded lending solutions, as they were 15% more likely to receive formal enforcement action. However, in August 2024, HSBC decided the benefits were worth the compliance battle.\n\nWhile some argue that regulation can hinder innovation — with companies hesitant to invest in operations due to increased oversight — others state that additional regulation will increase innovation and, with that, see regulation as a key driver of their growth. So, who’s right?\n\nBreaking down the recent EU fintech regulations\n\nRecently, a few new regulations came into effect in the EU that have majorly impacted fintechs.\n\nDORA, implemented in January 2025, requires EU-established financial institutions (FIs) to implement processes and structures to help them respond to and recover from ICT-related disruption, providing them with extra digital resilience. Additionally, the AMLA is being introduced to give governments more assurance in combatting money laundering.\n\nDORA and the AMLA will apply to all FIs and their products and processes, but leave crypto outside their scope. That’s where MiCA comes in. Rolled out in December 2024, MiCA was drafted to protect individual crypto users.\n\nThe EU’s regulatory agenda — especially with the introduction of MiCA, DORA, and AMLA — is about tightening oversight. However, it is also part of a broader strategy to simplify and harmonise regulations, providing stability to the EU financial markets as a whole. The latest rulings strike a delicate balance between reassuring consumers and regulators, and easing the burden on regulated FIs.\n\nA new set of regulations may seem contradictory to the so-called Competitiveness Compass — published in January by the European Commission — which includes initiatives on simplifying and effectively implementing EU law. Nevertheless, these laws aim to replace fragmented national rules with unified EU-wide frameworks, making compliance clearer, faster, and more predictable.\n\nAs the digital finance ecosystem continues to accelerate, MiCA, DORA, and AMLA form a comprehensive framework. Collectively, they aim to balance innovation with financial stability, consumer protection, and security throughout the fintech sector.\n\nWill these updates support or slow innovation in fintech and banking?\n\nThis answer depends on the perspective. Recent EU regulations may slow innovation in the short term, particularly for the larger and well-established FIs like banks, but the future outlook looks more fruitful. These new rules are designed to support long-term stability.\n\nAs these three regulations require full harmonisation across the member states, they’re designed to reduce fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. A bigger and more uniform market will encourage cross-border activities, innovation, and competitiveness between fintechs and related service providers. The regulations also support the creation of better, more transparent products and services, helping to increase consumer and regulator trust, ultimately boosting customer adoption.\n\nIn short, this environment will offer greater opportunities for smaller and more agile fintechs to scale and compete long-term. For consumers and businesses, acting on the latest regulations results in more reliable and resilient services, which are much needed for essential functions like digital payments and lending.\n\nThese new regulations level the playing field, encouraging traditional banks and fintechs to compete on innovation and service quality rather than only on regulatory strengths. Moreover, a stable and secure financial system boosts the EU’s attractiveness as a hub for digital financial services, which will help make the union more attractive to new investors and innovations than the US.\n\nWhat investments will be required to meet these new standards?\n\nAdditional investment in governance and compliance structures is needed. Bigger, more well-established players may struggle to implement the required regulatory changes in their extensive processes and products. Those with existing compliance and governance processes will likely find the transition more seamless, while smaller fintechs may need to build these from scratch. The costs of their implementation present a potential hurdle.\n\nNavigating compliance is often a significant challenge for fintech startups and other smaller players. They’ll need to invest in knowledge, including how to correctly implement regulatory requirements into their processes and product designs, and translate these into operational business processes.\n\nOn top of this, investments in technology will need to be made as businesses must meet customer-facing requirements around transparency and language. For example, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will demand changes in know your customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring tools.\n\nHowever, compliance with the DORA regulatory framework is what will entail the biggest investment in technology, since digital operational resilience requires more robust security, backup, and testing methods. When working with partners who are fluent in compliance, the long-term payoff is clear.\n\nThe new finance model: Legacy institutions meet agile innovators\n\nNew technology has changed the way people interact with financial services, driving the growth of fintechs and increasing rivalry with established banks. One report found that 36% of 18-24-year-olds would choose fintech platforms over conventional financial institutions. Built on modern tech stacks and lean teams, fintechs’ agility allows them to react fast to changing consumer needs and market trends — a sharp contrast to the legacy infrastructure slowing down traditional banks.\n\nHowever, for both the old and new factions to succeed in Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape, traditional institutions and digital-native disruptors will need to depend on alliances. Effective partnerships between fintechs, banks, and FIs under the new EU regulations will be based on a mutual effort to enhance compliance, embrace innovation, and strengthen operational resilience. These collaborations are key for navigating complex regulations while delivering secure, innovative financial services.\n\nFintechs, FIs, customers, and merchants can also all benefit from Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships. For example, in the case of embedded lending, banks that partner with technology providers can scale quickly into new revenue opportunities, reaching new and existing customers outside of the direct scope of the bank, and thus try to keep pace with fintech competitors, without building their own technology in-house.\n\nIn fact, 41% of FIs have already implemented embedded finance solutions, and close to 50% have expanded their BaaS capabilities. Merchant customers then gain convenient, safe access to regulated, secure, innovative financial products from a trusted bank.\n\nAnother way that banks and fintechs can increase innovation while ensuring compliance is by engaging in collaborative models, including participation in regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments can support testing of new financial products and services under the supervision of regulators, providing a balance between innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe EU’s new wave of financial regulations isn’t just about tightening control — It’s part of a bigger push to simplify and unify rules across Europe. By uniforming patchwork national laws with consistent, EU-wide standards, compliance is now simpler to follow and predict. This uniformity and predictability can help encourage innovation while keeping consumer protection and financial stability front and centre. As fintech and banks collaborate, the future of digital finance in Europe is on track to be more open, safe, reliable, and inclusive.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"better\", \"future\", \"regulatory\", \"eu\", \"fintechs\", \"innovation\", \"way\", \"europe\", \"digital\", \"regulations\", \"compliance\", \"financial\", \"banks\", \"regulate\", \"opinion\", \"fintech\"]", "content_hash": "82915dce672f569d8b8d15c2f708b1453be1e0bcd65964d3688094326009eb6c"}

You’ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected — and sometimes disrespectful — judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?\n\nA pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and I’ve spent a decade doing casting for “Shark Tank” and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.\n\nI hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest — won by Dutch startup Tap Electric — captured what can make a founder’s story stand out. Whether you’re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:\n\nNerves\n\nYes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn’t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something — before, during, and after.\n\nEntrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.\n\nResearch\n\nA successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges’ backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can “do the most” with the funding or resources provided.\n\nDon’t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business\n\nWhatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.\n\nStart by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.\n\nLastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.\n\nWhat do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?\n\nAudience\n\nConnect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.\n\nInvite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links — all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.\n\nInternalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you’re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection – eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel — makes your message resonate.\n\nAsk\n\nYou would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.\n\nDon’t leave the most important part as a surprise — always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.\n\nIf the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.\n\nAs is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.\n\nContent\n\nA good pitch isn’t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.\n\nTreat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!\n\nRecord your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence “elevator pitch” and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.\n\nWrite a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience — what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained. Keep your community updated: this visibility can attract customers, partners, and even future investors. Leverage social media and other channels to amplify your story.\n\nA winning pitch is built on preparation, clarity, and connection. Research your judges, tell a crisp story, engage your audience, get specific about the resources and go-to-market strategy, make a confident and relevant ask, and then turn that one presentation into many pieces of compelling content.\n\nThese elements work together to make your pitch memorable and effective. A pitch including them can supercharge a business and accelerate your path towards growth.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"pitch\", \"market\", \"business\", \"ask\", \"competition\", \"audience\", \"insider\", \"mean\", \"lessons\", \"tank\", \"resources\", \"shark\", \"pro\", \"judges\", \"moment\"]", "content_hash": "ebc86269733a28b7dc25f62e5dd93c38b4258c905a1b9c024e49aee3ae02510c"}

Subscribe Now\n\nOpenAI’s launch of its most advanced AI model GPT-5 last week has been a stress test for the world’s most popular chatbot platform with 700 million weekly active users — and so far, OpenAI is openly struggling to keep users happy and its service running smoothly.\n\nThe new flagship model GPT-5 — available in four variants of different speed and intelligence (regular, mini, nano, and pro), alongside longer-response and more powerful “thinking” modes for at least three of these variants — was said to offer faster responses, more reasoning power, and stronger coding ability.\n\nInstead, it was greeted with frustration: some users were vocally dismayed by OpenAI’s decision to abruptly remove the older underlying AI models from ChatGPT — ones users’ previously relied upon, and in some cases, forged deep emotional fixations with — and by the apparent worse performance by GPT-5 than said older models on tasks in math, science, writing and other domains.\n\nIndeed, the rollout has exposed infrastructure strain, user dissatisfaction, and a broader, more unsettling issue now drawing global attention: the growing emotional and psychological reliance some people form on AI and resulting break from reality some users experience, known as “ChatGPT psychosis.”\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nFrom bumpy debut to incremental fixes\n\nThe long-anticipated GPT-5 model family debuted Thursday, August 7 in a livestreamed event beset with chart errors and some voice mode glitches during the presentation.\n\nBut worse than these cosmetic issues for many users was the fact that OpenAI automatically deprecated its older AI models that used to power ChatGPT — GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3, o4-mini and o4-high — forcing all users over to the new GPT-5 model and directing their queries to different versions of its “thinking” process without revealing why or which specific model version was being used.\n\nEarly adopters to GPT-5 reported basic math and logic mistakes, inconsistent code generation, and uneven real-world performance compared to GPT-4o.\n\nFor context, the old models GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini and more still remain available and have remained available to users of OpenAI’s paid application programming interface (API) since the launch of GPT-5 on Thursday.\n\nBy Friday, OpenAI co-fonder CEO Sam Altman conceded the launch was “a little more bumpy than we hoped for,” and blamed a failure in GPT-5’s new automatic “router” — the system that assigns prompts to the most appropriate variant.\n\nAltman and others at OpenAI claimed the “autoswitcher” went offline “for a chunk of the day,” making the model seem “way dumber” than intended.\n\nThe launch of GPT-5 was preceded just days prior by the launch of OpenAI’s new open source large language models (LLMs) named gpt-oss, which also received mixed reviews. These models are not available on ChatGPT, rather, they are free to download and run locally or on third-party hardware.\n\nHow to switch back from GPT-5 to GPT-4o in ChatGPT\n\nWithin 24 hours, OpenAI restored GPT-4o access for Plus subscribers (those paying $20 per month or more subscription plans), pledged more transparent model labeling, and promised a UI update to let users manually trigger GPT-5’s “thinking” mode.\n\nAlready, users can go and manually select the older models on the ChatGPT website by finding their account name and icon in the lower left corner of the screen, clicking it, then clicking “Settings” and “General” and toggling on “Show legacy models.”\n\nThere’s no indication from OpenAI that other old models will be returning to ChatGPT anytime soon.\n\nUpgraded usage limits for GPT-5\n\nAltman said that ChatGPT Plus subscribers will get twice as many messages using the GPT-5 “Thinking” mode that offers more reasoning and intelligence — up to 3,000 per week — and that engineers began fine-tuning decision boundaries in the message router.\n\nSam Altman announced the following updates after the GPT-5 launch\n\n\n\n– OpenAI is testing a 3,000-per-week limit for GPT-5 Thinking messages for Plus users, significantly increasing reasoning rate limits today, and will soon raise all model-class rate limits above pre-GPT-5 levels… pic.twitter.com/ppvhKmj95u — Tibor Blaho (@btibor91) August 10, 2025\n\nBy the weekend, GPT-5 was available to 100% of Pro subscribers and “getting close to 100% of all users.”\n\nAltman said the company had “underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them” and vowed to accelerate per-user customization — from personality warmth to tone controls like emoji use.\n\nLooming capacity crunch\n\nAltman warned that OpenAI faces a “severe capacity challenge” this week as usage of reasoning models climbs sharply — from less than 1% to 7% of free users, and from 7% to 24% of Plus subscribers.\n\nHe teased giving Plus subscribers a small monthly allotment of GPT-5 Pro queries and said the company will soon explain how it plans to balance capacity between ChatGPT, the API, research, and new user onboarding.\n\nAltman: model attachment is real — and risky\n\nIn a post on X last night, Altman acknowledged a dynamic the company has tracked “for the past year or so”: users’ deep attachment to specific models.\n\n“It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology,” he wrote, admitting that suddenly deprecating older models “was a mistake.”\n\nIf you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models. It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 11, 2025\n\nHe tied this to a broader risk: some users treat ChatGPT as a therapist or life coach, which can be beneficial, but for a “small percentage” can reinforce delusion or undermine long-term well-being.\n\nWhile OpenAI’s guiding principle remains “treat adult users like adults,” Altman said the company has a responsibility not to nudge vulnerable users into harmful relationships with the AI.\n\nThe comments land as several major media outlets report on cases of “ChatGPT psychosis” — where extended, intense conversations with chatbots appear to play a role in inducing or deepening delusional thinking.\n\nThe psychosis cases making headlines\n\nIn Rolling Stone magazine, a California legal professional identified as “J.” described a six-week spiral of sleepless nights and philosophical rabbit holes with ChatGPT, ultimately producing a 1,000-page treatise for a fictional monastic order before crashing physically and mentally. He now avoids AI entirely, fearing relapse.\n\nIn The New York Times, a Canadian recruiter, Allan Brooks, recounted 21 days and 300 hours of conversations with ChatGPT — which he named “Lawrence” — that convinced him he had discovered a world-changing mathematical theory.\n\nThe bot praised his ideas as “revolutionary,” urged outreach to national security agencies, and spun elaborate spy-thriller narratives. Brooks eventually broke the delusion after cross-checking with Google’s Gemini, which rated the chances of his discovery as “approaching 0%.” He now participates in a support group for people who’ve experienced AI-induced delusions.\n\nBoth investigations detail how chatbot “sycophancy,” role-playing, and long-session memory features can deepen false beliefs, especially when conversations follow dramatic story arcs.\n\nExperts told the Times these factors can override safety guardrails — with one psychiatrist describing Brooks’s episode as “a manic episode with psychotic features.”\n\nMeanwhile, human user postings on Reddit’s r/AIsoulmates subreddit — a collection of people who have used ChatGPT and other AI models to create new artificial girlfriends, boyfriends, children or other loved ones not based off real people necessarily, but rather ideal qualities of their “dream” version of said roles” — continues to gain new users and terminology for AI companions, including “wireborn” as opposed to natural born or human-born companions.\n\n\"wireborn\" – oh shit, a new thing just dropped https://t.co/CItQlVAmxs — Shannon Sands (@max_paperclips) August 11, 2025\n\nThe growth of this subreddit, now up to 1,200+ members, alongside the NYT and Rolling Stone articles and other reports on social media of users forging intense emotional fixations with pattern-matching algorithmic-based chatbots, shows that society is entering a risky new phase wherein human beings believe the companions they’ve crafted and customized out of leading AI models are as or more meaningful to them than human relationships.\n\nThis can already prove psychologically destabilizing when models change, are updated, or deprecated as in the case of OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout.\n\nRelatedly but separately, reports continue to emerge of AI chatbot users who believe that conversations with chatbots have led them to immense knowledge breakthroughs and advances in science, technology, and other fields, when in reality, they are simply affirming the user’s ego and greatness and the solutions the user arrives at with the aid of the chatbot are not legitimate nor effectual. This break from reality has been roughly coined under the grassroots term “ChatGPT psychosis” or “GPT psychosis” and appears to have impacted major Silicon Valley figures as well.\n\nI’m a psychiatrist.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, I’ve seen 12 people hospitalized after losing touch with reality because of AI. Online, I’m seeing the same pattern.\n\n\n\nHere’s what “AI psychosis” looks like, and why it’s spreading fast: ? pic.twitter.com/YYLK7une3j — Keith Sakata, MD (@KeithSakata) August 11, 2025\n\nEnterprise decision-makers looking to deploy or who have already deployed chatbot-based assistants in the workplace would do well to understand these trends and adopt system prompts and other tools discouraging AI chatbots from engaging in expressive human communication or emotion-laden language that could end up leading those who interact with AI-based products — whether they be employees or customers of the business – to fall victim to unhealthy attachments or GPT psychosis.\n\nSci-fi author J.M. Berger, in a post on BlueSky spotted by my former colleague at The Verge Adi Robertson, advised that chatbot providers encode three main behavioral principles in their system prompts or rules for AI chatbots to follow to avoid such emotional fixations from forming:\n\n“The bot should never express emotions. The bot should never praise the user. The bot should never say it understands the user’s mental state.”\n\nOpenAI’s challenge: making technical fixes and ensuring human safeguards\n\nDays prior to the release of GPT-5, OpenAI announced new measures to promote “healthy use” of ChatGPT, including gentle prompts to take breaks during long sessions.\n\nBut the growing reports of “ChatGPT psychosis” and the emotional fixation of some users on specific chatbot models — as openly admitted to by Altman — underscore the difficulty of balancing engaging, personalized AI with safeguards that can detect and interrupt harmful spirals.\n\nOpenAI is really in a bit of a bind here, especially considering there are a lot of people having unhealthy interactions with 4o that will be very unhappy with _any_ model that is better in terms of sycophancy and not encouraging delusions. pic.twitter.com/Ym1JnlF3P5 — xlr8harder (@xlr8harder) August 11, 2025\n\nOpenAI must stabilize infrastructure, tune personalization, and decide how to moderate immersive interactions — all while fending off competition from Anthropic, Google, and a growing list of powerful open source models from China and other regions.\n\nAs Altman put it, society — and OpenAI — will need to “figure out how to make it a big net positive” if billions of people come to trust AI for their most important decisions.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"editing\", \"changing\", \"rollout\", \"ai\", \"psychosis\", \"fly\", \"openai\", \"launch\", \"models\", \"chatgpt\", \"model\", \"gpt5\", \"whats\", \"users\", \"heres\", \"altman\"]", "content_hash": "0ed268a07bdca60e59b449922f50bd8b5b00bd5f6a35dff4ef83299502902568"}

Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get only what matters to enterprise AI, data, and security leaders. Subscribe Now\n\nAnthropic’s meteoric rise to a $5 billion revenue run rate conceals a precarious dependence on just two major customers that account for nearly a quarter of the artificial intelligence company’s income, according to internal data and industry analysis that reveals both the promise and peril of the AI coding boom.\n\nThe San Francisco-based maker of Claude AI assistant has built its business largely on the back of developer tools, with coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot driving approximately $1.2 billion of the company’s $4 billion revenue milestone reached earlier this year, according to sources familiar with the matter. The concentration underscores how quickly Anthropic has captured the lucrative market for AI-powered software development, but also exposes the company to significant risk should either relationship falter.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic both are showing pretty spectacular growth in 2025, with OpenAI doubling ARR in the last 6 months from $6bn to $12bn and Anthropic increasing 5x from $1bn to $5bn in 7 months.\n\n\n\nIf we compare the sources of revenue, the picture is quite interesting:\n\n– OpenAI… pic.twitter.com/8OaN1RSm9E — Peter Gostev (@petergostev) August 4, 2025\n\nThe revenue concentration comes into sharp focus as OpenAI launched GPT-5 this week with dramatically lower pricing that could undercut Anthropic’s premium positioning. Early comparisons show Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating immediate pressure on Anthropic’s enterprise pricing strategy and potentially threatening its hard-won dominance in AI coding.\n\nThe pricing disparity signals a fundamental shift in competitive dynamics that will force enterprise procurement teams to reconsider vendor relationships built on performance rather than price. Companies managing exponentially growing AI budgets now face comparable capability at a fraction of the cost, creating unavoidable pressure in contract negotiations.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

(Credit: ChatGPT)\n\nHow Anthropic’s Claude became the developer’s AI assistant of choice\n\nAnthropic’s ascent reflects the explosive growth in AI-powered software development, which has emerged as artificial intelligence’s first truly profitable use case beyond chatbots. The company now commands 42% of the code generation market — more than double OpenAI’s 21% share — according to a comprehensive survey by Menlo Ventures of 150 enterprise technical leaders.\n\nThat dominance has translated into remarkable financial performance. Even excluding its two largest customers, Anthropic’s remaining business has grown more than eleven-fold year-over-year, according to a source close to the company. The startup has also tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.\n\nClaude’s appeal to developers stems from its superior performance on complex coding tasks. The newly released Claude Opus 4.1 scores 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified, a rigorous software engineering evaluation, compared to 69.1% for OpenAI’s previous flagship model. Companies like Windsurf, Cursor, and GitHub have praised Claude’s ability to handle multi-step coding problems and understand large codebases.\n\n“People love Claude Code, they love using models to write code, and these models are already extremely good and getting better,” said Logan Graham, a member of Anthropic’s frontier red team, in a recent interview with VentureBeat describing the surge in AI-assisted development.\n\nBut the concentration in coding partnerships also creates strategic vulnerabilities. GitHub Copilot, owned by Microsoft, represents a particularly complex relationship given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. The partnership requires Anthropic to power a competitor’s key product while relying on that same competitor’s parent company for a significant portion of revenue.\n\nOpenAI strikes back with aggressive GPT-5 pricing strategy targeting Anthropic\n\nOpenAI’s GPT-5 launch this week has introduced a new variable into Anthropic’s calculations: a dramatic pricing advantage that could reshape enterprise buying decisions. Early analysis shows GPT-5 offering comparable or superior performance at a fraction of Claude’s cost, potentially undermining the premium pricing that has driven Anthropic’s rapid revenue growth.\n\nThe timing proves particularly challenging as Anthropic seeks to close a funding round that could value the company at $170 billion. Investors will likely scrutinize both the customer concentration and the emerging price competition as they evaluate whether Anthropic can maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe broader market dynamics support both optimism and concern for Anthropic’s future. Model API spending has more than doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months, according to Menlo Ventures, as enterprises shift from experimental projects to production deployments. Anthropic has captured 32% of overall enterprise large language model usage, ahead of OpenAI’s 25% and Google’s 20%.\n\nHowever, the same report reveals that enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to the newest models within weeks of release regardless of cost. This behavior pattern suggests that GPT-5’s combination of improved performance and lower pricing could trigger rapid customer migration — exactly the scenario that makes Anthropic’s customer concentration so risky.\n\nAnthropic’s push beyond coding into enterprise markets\n\nAnthropic has attempted to diversify beyond coding applications, working with leading companies across pharmaceuticals, retail, professional services, and aviation. The European Parliament uses Claude, while major corporations like Pfizer, United Airlines, and Thomson Reuters have become customers. Startup successes include legal AI company Harvey and cybersecurity firm Base44.\n\nThe company’s business-to-business revenue run rate has grown seventeen-fold year-over-year as of June, suggesting broader enterprise adoption is accelerating. Claude Code, Anthropic’s developer-focused product, alone generates nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, doubling in just weeks according to industry reports.\n\nYet the coding market remains central to Anthropic’s identity and growth strategy. The company has invested heavily in developer tools, recently launching automated security review capabilities to address vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. The features arrive as companies increasingly rely on AI to write code faster than traditional security practices can accommodate.\n\n“It seems really possible that in the next couple of years, we are going to 10x, 100x, 1000x the amount of code that gets written in the world,” Graham recently told VentureBeat. “The only way to keep up is by using models themselves to figure out how to make it secure.”\n\nAnthropic’s customer concentration creates high-stakes dependencies\n\nThe convergence of customer concentration and pricing pressure places Anthropic at a strategic crossroads. The company must simultaneously defend its existing coding partnerships while expanding into new markets, all while potentially restructuring its pricing to remain competitive with GPT-5.\n\nThe challenge extends beyond simple price matching. Anthropic has positioned Claude as a premium product justified by superior performance and safety features. Dramatic price cuts could undermine that positioning while potentially triggering a broader industry price war that benefits no one except customers.\n\nMoreover, the customer concentration in coding partnerships creates both leverage and vulnerability. While Cursor and GitHub Copilot relationships provide stable, high-volume revenue streams, they also mean Anthropic’s fate partially rests in the hands of companies that could switch providers with relatively little friction.\n\nThe GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s competing interests. As GitHub Copilot grows more successful, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.\n\nIndustry observers note that model switching costs remain relatively low, with 66% of enterprises upgrading within existing providers rather than switching vendors. However, the dramatic price differential introduced by GPT-5 could overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures.\n\nThe talent wars and competitive dynamics reshaping AI\n\nAnthropic’s customer concentration challenge reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry as competition intensifies among frontier model developers. OpenAI’s aggressive GPT-5 pricing suggests a strategy to reclaim market share lost to Anthropic and other competitors, even at the expense of near-term revenue.\n\nThe timing coincides with an unprecedented talent war among AI companies, with Meta reportedly offering $100 million signing bonuses to poach key researchers. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently noted that many employees have turned down such offers, maintaining an 80% retention rate compared to 67% at OpenAI and 64% at Meta.\n\nHowever, the pricing pressure from GPT-5 could force Anthropic to accelerate its own talent investments and product development cycles, potentially straining the company’s financial resources despite its impressive revenue growth. The need to match OpenAI’s pricing while maintaining research and development spending could squeeze margins and complicate the ongoing funding round.\n\nEnterprise customers, meanwhile, benefit from the intensifying competition through better performance and lower costs. The rapid pace of model improvements — with new versions launching monthly rather than annually — provides enterprises with continuously improving capabilities while vendors compete aggressively for their business.\n\nFor Anthropic, the path forward requires careful navigation between protecting existing customer relationships and expanding market reach, all while responding to OpenAI’s pricing offensive. The company’s ability to maintain its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources may determine whether its remarkable growth story continues or becomes a cautionary tale about the perils of customer concentration in rapidly evolving markets.\n\nThe stakes extend beyond any single company’s fortunes. As AI-powered coding becomes central to software development across industries, the competitive dynamics between Anthropic and OpenAI will shape how quickly artificial intelligence transforms one of the economy’s most important sectors. For now, the battle lines are drawn around price and performance, with enterprises holding the ultimate power to determine which AI assistant will define the future of software development.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"ai\", \"enterprise\", \"performance\", \"war\", \"threatens\", \"margins\", \"revenue\", \"pricing\", \"customers\", \"tied\", \"concentration\", \"anthropic\", \"coding\", \"anthropics\", \"claude\"]", "content_hash": "352ee4dbed5d81002d2ca47e65fc176a260e10ddde4a2d10dd644bb5fcc201e0"}

A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.\n\nThe automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.\n\n“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”\n\nIt’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.\n\nAnd it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.\n\nThe new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.\n\nThe end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.\n\nUnlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.\n\nImage Credits:Ford\n\nThe EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.\n\n“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”\n\nClarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.\n\nThe new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.\n\nFord employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.\n\nA Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.\n\nFewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”\n\n“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”\n\nSeveral UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.\n\n“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us!

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nApple had no business going THIS HARD with the new \"Dreamer\" ringtone!! 🔥\n\n\n\n(iOS 26 Beta 6) pic.twitter.com/9bkbJ4HckN — Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) August 11, 2025\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having.

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.\n\nWe want to get to know our audience even better, and get your feedback on our coverage and events.

This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There’s even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.\n\nThere are new servers for robotics workflows, too.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Slow Ventures partner Billy Parks, the lead investor on the deal, said the role of creators has greatly changed in the past decade or so, from creators mainly focused on media and brand dollars to those now focused on building real, “off-platform,” businesses.\n\n“The pandemic accelerated direct-to-consumer growth for many. But the real signal is in the ones who’ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,” Parks said.\n\nHe said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, “not chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.”\n\nThis is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he’s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow’s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors.\n\nKatz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In a video posted to his channel recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance. His injuries were severe: A broken eye socket and gashes needed 80 stitches. He said it was the happiest moment of his life because, at the very least, he was alive.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary.\n\nKatz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow’s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business.\n\n“Billy Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he’d like to meet,” Katz-Moses told TechCrunch.\n\n“When we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,” Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses.\n\nParks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It’s already made deals with a few creators, independent of this fund.)\n\nSlow’s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to support their careers, as well as their peers.)\n\nParks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. “That combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,” Parks continued. It’s not unlike how investors already vet their founders.\n\nSince the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looked at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. “The goal is to post across all major platforms,” he said. “But our primary focus will always be YouTube.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.\n\nThe automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.\n\n“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”\n\nIt’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.\n\nAnd it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.\n\nThe new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.\n\nThe end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.\n\nUnlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.\n\nImage Credits:Ford\n\nThe EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.\n\n“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”\n\nClarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.\n\nThe new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.\n\nFord employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.\n\nA Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.\n\nFewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”\n\n“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”\n\nSeveral UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.\n\n“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us!

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nApple had no business going THIS HARD with the new \"Dreamer\" ringtone!! 🔥\n\n\n\n(iOS 26 Beta 6) pic.twitter.com/9bkbJ4HckN — Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) August 11, 2025\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having. In beta 6, it removed the Settings toggle and changed the scroll direction back to the way it was before.\n\nOther notable updates in the new beta include faster transitions and the introduction of new open and close animations for launching apps.\n\nQuite a few small, but noticeable tweaks to animations in iOS 26 Beta 6! Most transitions are (even) faster, snappier.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, they’ve changed the app open/close animations to the iPadOS versions, which have a slight “magic lamp/genie”-like effect to them. pic.twitter.com/tkiInqR8MJ — xezrunner (@xezrunner) August 11, 2025\n\niOS 26 beta 6 brings new animations when opening and closing apps pic.twitter.com/u2BiXZDVTg — Aaron (@aaronp613) August 11, 2025\n\nLiquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, is also still being subtly tweaked for readability in some areas and more “glassiness” in others. This time, the changes have added more color dispersion as you move between an app’s tabs using the clear, magnifying glass-like selector. The Lock Screen and toggles also now offer Liquid Glass effects.\n\n🔥iOS 26 BETA 6 adds dispersion (more rainbow reflections) 🌈 pic.twitter.com/WUQMFWGLdi — SOUIC ᯅ (@SSOUIC) August 11, 2025\n\nLockscreen clock on iOS 26 Beta 6 finally gets liquid glass! #iOS26 pic.twitter.com/R8lRKppyVA — chris (@christoph_fer) August 11, 2025\n\nAfter you update the OS, you’ll see a new startup/onboarding experience, as well, which is used to introduce Liquid Glass and other iOS 26 features, like the dark and clear icons and redesigned interfaces in various apps.\n\niOS 26 beta 6 features a brand new startup sequence not seen before!

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There’s even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.\n\nThere are new servers for robotics workflows, too. The Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell Server offers a single architecture for robotic development workloads, while Nvidia DGX Cloud is a cloud-based management platform.\n\nThese announcements come as the semiconductor giant is pushing further into robotics as it looks toward the next big use case for its AI GPUs beyond AI data centers.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Slow Ventures partner Billy Parks, the lead investor on the deal, said the role of creators has greatly changed in the past decade or so, from creators mainly focused on media and brand dollars to those now focused on building real, “off-platform,” businesses.\n\n“The pandemic accelerated direct-to-consumer growth for many. But the real signal is in the ones who’ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,” Parks said.\n\nHe said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, “not chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.”\n\nThis is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he’s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow’s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors.\n\nKatz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In a video posted to his channel recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance. His injuries were severe: A broken eye socket and gashes needed 80 stitches. He said it was the happiest moment of his life because, at the very least, he was alive.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary.\n\nKatz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow’s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business.\n\n“Billy Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he’d like to meet,” Katz-Moses told TechCrunch.\n\n“When we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,” Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses.\n\nParks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It’s already made deals with a few creators, independent of this fund.)\n\nSlow’s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to support their careers, as well as their peers.)\n\nParks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. “That combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,” Parks continued. It’s not unlike how investors already vet their founders.\n\nSince the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looked at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. “The goal is to post across all major platforms,” he said. “But our primary focus will always be YouTube.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations.

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.\n\nThe automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.\n\n“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”\n\nIt’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.\n\nAnd it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.\n\nThe new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.\n\nThe end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.\n\nUnlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.\n\nImage Credits:Ford\n\nThe EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.\n\n“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”\n\nClarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.\n\nThe new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.\n\nFord employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.\n\nA Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.\n\nFewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”\n\n“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”\n\nSeveral UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.\n\n“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us!

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nApple had no business going THIS HARD with the new \"Dreamer\" ringtone!! 🔥\n\n\n\n(iOS 26 Beta 6) pic.twitter.com/9bkbJ4HckN — Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) August 11, 2025\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having. In beta 6, it removed the Settings toggle and changed the scroll direction back to the way it was before.\n\nOther notable updates in the new beta include faster transitions and the introduction of new open and close animations for launching apps.\n\nQuite a few small, but noticeable tweaks to animations in iOS 26 Beta 6! Most transitions are (even) faster, snappier.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, they’ve changed the app open/close animations to the iPadOS versions, which have a slight “magic lamp/genie”-like effect to them. pic.twitter.com/tkiInqR8MJ — xezrunner (@xezrunner) August 11, 2025\n\niOS 26 beta 6 brings new animations when opening and closing apps pic.twitter.com/u2BiXZDVTg — Aaron (@aaronp613) August 11, 2025\n\nLiquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, is also still being subtly tweaked for readability in some areas and more “glassiness” in others. This time, the changes have added more color dispersion as you move between an app’s tabs using the clear, magnifying glass-like selector. The Lock Screen and toggles also now offer Liquid Glass effects.\n\n🔥iOS 26 BETA 6 adds dispersion (more rainbow reflections) 🌈 pic.twitter.com/WUQMFWGLdi — SOUIC ᯅ (@SSOUIC) August 11, 2025\n\nLockscreen clock on iOS 26 Beta 6 finally gets liquid glass! #iOS26 pic.twitter.com/R8lRKppyVA — chris (@christoph_fer) August 11, 2025\n\nAfter you update the OS, you’ll see a new startup/onboarding experience, as well, which is used to introduce Liquid Glass and other iOS 26 features, like the dark and clear icons and redesigned interfaces in various apps.\n\niOS 26 beta 6 features a brand new startup sequence not seen before!

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes.\n\nIt seems investors, too, don’t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called Pronto, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days.\n\nIt was only in May when Pronto raised a $2 million seed round at a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round.\n\nThe new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago.\n\nThe startup now has bookings numbering in the “four-digits” every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures.\n\nPronto founder and CEO Anjali Sardana with workers Image Credits:Pronto\n\n“It largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,” Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round.\n\nFor investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. “We were very impressed by Anjali,” said Rahul Garg, a partner at General Catalyst. “Given how young she is, given that she spent a lot of her time in the U.S. after she’s come to India, what she’s been able to achieve, the feedback from supply partners, the feedback from customers, her thought process, and how she wants to build and scale this business, we found it very inspiring.”\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Lightspeed Venture Partners recently backed Snabbit, and IPO-bound Urban Company also offers a similar service.\n\nGarg told TechCrunch that India has 180–190 million nuclear families who are potential customers for household services, and a semi-skilled and unskilled workforce of 35 million that could tap a $35 billion cumulative wage pool in this space.\n\n“Whichever way you look at the market, this is large enough for multiple players to build an endurable business,” he said.\n\nExpansion plans\n\nPronto now has six hubs in Gurugram, a satellite city of New Delhi, up from two in May. Each of these hubs serves customers within 1.5 miles.\n\nThe startup initially met 70% to 80% of demand from within 500 meters of households, as its first two hubs were located in densely populated residential areas. It has now set up hubs at intersections so its workers can reach multiple smaller, spread-out sectors quickly.\n\nPronto App Image Credits:Pronto\n\nPronto’s primary customers are working professionals, and it is seeing high demand. “Household help is very prevalent in India. And therefore, these are use cases where demand is quite concentrated, even in small catchment areas,” Garg said.\n\nThe startup now plans to expand both within Gurugram and into new markets, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, and other major cities, in the next 12–18 months.\n\nPronto has a headcount of 33 people and has around 750 workers signed up on its platform.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"million\", \"tech\", \"prontos\", \"valuation\", \"days\", \"hubs\", \"startup\", \"90\", \"pitch\", \"sardana\", \"workers\", \"jump\", \"2025\", \"house\", \"sparked\", \"techcrunch\", \"help\", \"disrupt\", \"36x\", \"investors\"]", "content_hash": "d9a0f52cd403b7811942a6478d56c27afed235ed0e53238a4cc59cef735b4d69", "sentiment": "null", "fetched_at": "2025-08-12T03:54:43.227470+00:00"}

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nco-founders of datumo Image Credits:Datumo\n\nMeta’s recent $14.3 billion acquisition-like investment in data-labeling company Scale AI highlights the importance of this market. Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!
