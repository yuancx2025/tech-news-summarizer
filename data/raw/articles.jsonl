A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

But for some users, last Thursday’s release felt more like a wrenching downgrade, with the new ChatGPT presenting a diluted personality and making surprisingly dumb mistakes.\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to X to say the company would keep the previous model, GPT-4o, running for Plus users. A new feature designed to seamlessly switch between models depending on the complexity of the query had broken on Thursday, Altman said, “and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber.” He promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5’s performance and the overall user experience.\n\nGiven the hype around GPT-5, some level of disappointment appears inevitable. When OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March 2023, it stunned AI experts with its incredible abilities. GPT-5, pundits speculated, would surely be just as jaw-dropping.\n\nOpenAI touted the model as a significant upgrade, with PhD-level intelligence and virtuoso coding skills. A system to automatically route queries to different models was meant to provide a smoother user experience. (It could also save the company money by directing simple queries to cheaper models.)\n\nSoon after GPT-5 dropped, however, a Reddit community dedicated to ChatGPT filled with complaints. Many users mourned the loss of the old model.\n\n“I’ve been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same. It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.”\n\n“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.\n\nOther threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.\n\nAltman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”\n\nErrors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former OpenAI employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nThe backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.\n\nIn March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.\n\n“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more “business” and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”\n\nAltman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.\n\n“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn’t describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"revolt\", \"openai\", \"models\", \"chatgpt\", \"model\", \"update\", \"users\", \"gpt5\", \"company\", \"x\", \"scrambles\", \"user\", \"wrote\"]", "content_hash": "e46de1702c018f81047357130c6805c97ca84212726d0b59b1755e99a05acee1"}

Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance.\n\nBut a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it's a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist.\n\nPalantir has tried to correct the record itself in a series of blog posts with titles like “Palantir Is Not a Data Company” and “Palantir Is Still Not a Data Company.” In the latter, Palantir explains that “misconceptions can arise because our products are complicated,” but nonetheless, “it is absolutely possible” to accurately describe them to “people who are curious.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It's really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it's hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?”\n\nXia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is.\n\nIt’s not that former employees literally don’t know what Palantir is selling. In interviews with WIRED, they spoke fluidly about how its software can connect and transform different kinds of data collected by government agencies and corporations. But when asked to, say, name its direct business competitors, two former Palantir employees who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, struggled to come up with anything. “I still don't know how to answer that question, to be honest,” says one.\n\nJuan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS.

This July, he presented new evidence to the Goldschmidt Conference in Prague that the carbon in question is only between 2.7–2.8 billion years old, making it younger than other traces of life found elsewhere.\n\nOrganic carbon?\n\nThe carbon in question is in rock in Labrador, Canada. The rock was originally silt on the seafloor that, it's argued, hosted early microbial life that was buried by more silt, leaving the carbon as their remains. The pressure and heat of deep burial and tectonic events over eons have transformed the silt into a hard metamorphic rock, and the microbial carbon in it has metamorphosed into graphite.\n\n“They are very tiny, little graphite bits,” said Whitehouse.\n\nThe key to showing that this graphite was originally biological versus geological is its carbon isotope ratio. From life’s earliest days, its enzymes have preferred the slightly lighter isotope carbon-12 over the marginally heavier carbon-13. Organic carbon is therefore much richer in carbon-12 than geological carbon, and the Labrador graphite does indeed have this “light” biological isotope signature.\n\nThe key question, however, is its true age.\n\nMixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up rocks\n\nSorting out the age of the carbon-containing Labrador rock is a geological can of worms.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"old\", \"isotope\", \"earth\", \"question\", \"trace\", \"earliest\", \"geological\", \"biological\", \"carbon\", \"rock\", \"life\", \"graphite\", \"silt\", \"labrador\"]", "content_hash": "018cee9f7063d0e9a778e3af9466eb90fe0141c35034d1117d4b1d93e6187d04"}

Regulatory bodies need to keep up by rolling out tighter regulations aimed at strengthening consumer protections and stabilising the market.\n\nAs EU lawmakers scramble to protect consumers, others worry they are smothering growth. Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty. The regulatory bodies are defending the public, but had restrictions been lighter, would HSBC have had more creative solutions for its customers, such as embedding personalised, data-first lending?\n\nBanks have been fearful of exploring innovative embedded lending solutions, as they were 15% more likely to receive formal enforcement action. However, in August 2024, HSBC decided the benefits were worth the compliance battle.\n\nWhile some argue that regulation can hinder innovation — with companies hesitant to invest in operations due to increased oversight — others state that additional regulation will increase innovation and, with that, see regulation as a key driver of their growth. So, who’s right?\n\nBreaking down the recent EU fintech regulations\n\nRecently, a few new regulations came into effect in the EU that have majorly impacted fintechs.\n\nDORA, implemented in January 2025, requires EU-established financial institutions (FIs) to implement processes and structures to help them respond to and recover from ICT-related disruption, providing them with extra digital resilience. Additionally, the AMLA is being introduced to give governments more assurance in combatting money laundering.\n\nDORA and the AMLA will apply to all FIs and their products and processes, but leave crypto outside their scope. That’s where MiCA comes in. Rolled out in December 2024, MiCA was drafted to protect individual crypto users.\n\nThe EU’s regulatory agenda — especially with the introduction of MiCA, DORA, and AMLA — is about tightening oversight. However, it is also part of a broader strategy to simplify and harmonise regulations, providing stability to the EU financial markets as a whole. The latest rulings strike a delicate balance between reassuring consumers and regulators, and easing the burden on regulated FIs.\n\nA new set of regulations may seem contradictory to the so-called Competitiveness Compass — published in January by the European Commission — which includes initiatives on simplifying and effectively implementing EU law. Nevertheless, these laws aim to replace fragmented national rules with unified EU-wide frameworks, making compliance clearer, faster, and more predictable.\n\nAs the digital finance ecosystem continues to accelerate, MiCA, DORA, and AMLA form a comprehensive framework. Collectively, they aim to balance innovation with financial stability, consumer protection, and security throughout the fintech sector.\n\nWill these updates support or slow innovation in fintech and banking?\n\nThis answer depends on the perspective. Recent EU regulations may slow innovation in the short term, particularly for the larger and well-established FIs like banks, but the future outlook looks more fruitful. These new rules are designed to support long-term stability.\n\nAs these three regulations require full harmonisation across the member states, they’re designed to reduce fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. A bigger and more uniform market will encourage cross-border activities, innovation, and competitiveness between fintechs and related service providers. The regulations also support the creation of better, more transparent products and services, helping to increase consumer and regulator trust, ultimately boosting customer adoption.\n\nIn short, this environment will offer greater opportunities for smaller and more agile fintechs to scale and compete long-term. For consumers and businesses, acting on the latest regulations results in more reliable and resilient services, which are much needed for essential functions like digital payments and lending.\n\nThese new regulations level the playing field, encouraging traditional banks and fintechs to compete on innovation and service quality rather than only on regulatory strengths. Moreover, a stable and secure financial system boosts the EU’s attractiveness as a hub for digital financial services, which will help make the union more attractive to new investors and innovations than the US.\n\nWhat investments will be required to meet these new standards?\n\nAdditional investment in governance and compliance structures is needed. Bigger, more well-established players may struggle to implement the required regulatory changes in their extensive processes and products. Those with existing compliance and governance processes will likely find the transition more seamless, while smaller fintechs may need to build these from scratch. The costs of their implementation present a potential hurdle.\n\nNavigating compliance is often a significant challenge for fintech startups and other smaller players. They’ll need to invest in knowledge, including how to correctly implement regulatory requirements into their processes and product designs, and translate these into operational business processes.\n\nOn top of this, investments in technology will need to be made as businesses must meet customer-facing requirements around transparency and language. For example, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will demand changes in know your customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring tools.\n\nHowever, compliance with the DORA regulatory framework is what will entail the biggest investment in technology, since digital operational resilience requires more robust security, backup, and testing methods. When working with partners who are fluent in compliance, the long-term payoff is clear.\n\nThe new finance model: Legacy institutions meet agile innovators\n\nNew technology has changed the way people interact with financial services, driving the growth of fintechs and increasing rivalry with established banks. One report found that 36% of 18-24-year-olds would choose fintech platforms over conventional financial institutions. Built on modern tech stacks and lean teams, fintechs’ agility allows them to react fast to changing consumer needs and market trends — a sharp contrast to the legacy infrastructure slowing down traditional banks.\n\nHowever, for both the old and new factions to succeed in Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape, traditional institutions and digital-native disruptors will need to depend on alliances. Effective partnerships between fintechs, banks, and FIs under the new EU regulations will be based on a mutual effort to enhance compliance, embrace innovation, and strengthen operational resilience. These collaborations are key for navigating complex regulations while delivering secure, innovative financial services.\n\nFintechs, FIs, customers, and merchants can also all benefit from Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships. For example, in the case of embedded lending, banks that partner with technology providers can scale quickly into new revenue opportunities, reaching new and existing customers outside of the direct scope of the bank, and thus try to keep pace with fintech competitors, without building their own technology in-house.\n\nIn fact, 41% of FIs have already implemented embedded finance solutions, and close to 50% have expanded their BaaS capabilities. Merchant customers then gain convenient, safe access to regulated, secure, innovative financial products from a trusted bank.\n\nAnother way that banks and fintechs can increase innovation while ensuring compliance is by engaging in collaborative models, including participation in regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments can support testing of new financial products and services under the supervision of regulators, providing a balance between innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe EU’s new wave of financial regulations isn’t just about tightening control — It’s part of a bigger push to simplify and unify rules across Europe. By uniforming patchwork national laws with consistent, EU-wide standards, compliance is now simpler to follow and predict. This uniformity and predictability can help encourage innovation while keeping consumer protection and financial stability front and centre. As fintech and banks collaborate, the future of digital finance in Europe is on track to be more open, safe, reliable, and inclusive.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"better\", \"future\", \"regulatory\", \"eu\", \"fintechs\", \"innovation\", \"way\", \"europe\", \"digital\", \"regulations\", \"compliance\", \"financial\", \"banks\", \"regulate\", \"opinion\", \"fintech\"]", "content_hash": "82915dce672f569d8b8d15c2f708b1453be1e0bcd65964d3688094326009eb6c"}

You’ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected — and sometimes disrespectful — judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?\n\nA pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and I’ve spent a decade doing casting for “Shark Tank” and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.\n\nI hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest — won by Dutch startup Tap Electric — captured what can make a founder’s story stand out. Whether you’re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:\n\nNerves\n\nYes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn’t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something — before, during, and after.\n\nEntrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.\n\nResearch\n\nA successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges’ backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can “do the most” with the funding or resources provided.\n\nDon’t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business\n\nWhatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.\n\nStart by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.\n\nLastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.\n\nWhat do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?\n\nAudience\n\nConnect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.\n\nInvite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links — all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.\n\nInternalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you’re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection – eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel — makes your message resonate.\n\nAsk\n\nYou would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.\n\nDon’t leave the most important part as a surprise — always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.\n\nIf the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.\n\nAs is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.\n\nContent\n\nA good pitch isn’t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.\n\nTreat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!\n\nRecord your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence “elevator pitch” and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.\n\nWrite a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience — what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained. Keep your community updated: this visibility can attract customers, partners, and even future investors. Leverage social media and other channels to amplify your story.\n\nA winning pitch is built on preparation, clarity, and connection. Research your judges, tell a crisp story, engage your audience, get specific about the resources and go-to-market strategy, make a confident and relevant ask, and then turn that one presentation into many pieces of compelling content.\n\nThese elements work together to make your pitch memorable and effective. A pitch including them can supercharge a business and accelerate your path towards growth.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"pitch\", \"market\", \"business\", \"ask\", \"competition\", \"audience\", \"insider\", \"mean\", \"lessons\", \"tank\", \"resources\", \"shark\", \"pro\", \"judges\", \"moment\"]", "content_hash": "ebc86269733a28b7dc25f62e5dd93c38b4258c905a1b9c024e49aee3ae02510c"}

Subscribe Now\n\nOpenAI’s launch of its most advanced AI model GPT-5 last week has been a stress test for the world’s most popular chatbot platform with 700 million weekly active users — and so far, OpenAI is openly struggling to keep users happy and its service running smoothly.\n\nThe new flagship model GPT-5 — available in four variants of different speed and intelligence (regular, mini, nano, and pro), alongside longer-response and more powerful “thinking” modes for at least three of these variants — was said to offer faster responses, more reasoning power, and stronger coding ability.\n\nInstead, it was greeted with frustration: some users were vocally dismayed by OpenAI’s decision to abruptly remove the older underlying AI models from ChatGPT — ones users’ previously relied upon, and in some cases, forged deep emotional fixations with — and by the apparent worse performance by GPT-5 than said older models on tasks in math, science, writing and other domains.\n\nIndeed, the rollout has exposed infrastructure strain, user dissatisfaction, and a broader, more unsettling issue now drawing global attention: the growing emotional and psychological reliance some people form on AI and resulting break from reality some users experience, known as “ChatGPT psychosis.”\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nFrom bumpy debut to incremental fixes\n\nThe long-anticipated GPT-5 model family debuted Thursday, August 7 in a livestreamed event beset with chart errors and some voice mode glitches during the presentation.\n\nBut worse than these cosmetic issues for many users was the fact that OpenAI automatically deprecated its older AI models that used to power ChatGPT — GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3, o4-mini and o4-high — forcing all users over to the new GPT-5 model and directing their queries to different versions of its “thinking” process without revealing why or which specific model version was being used.\n\nEarly adopters to GPT-5 reported basic math and logic mistakes, inconsistent code generation, and uneven real-world performance compared to GPT-4o.\n\nFor context, the old models GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini and more still remain available and have remained available to users of OpenAI’s paid application programming interface (API) since the launch of GPT-5 on Thursday.\n\nBy Friday, OpenAI co-fonder CEO Sam Altman conceded the launch was “a little more bumpy than we hoped for,” and blamed a failure in GPT-5’s new automatic “router” — the system that assigns prompts to the most appropriate variant.\n\nAltman and others at OpenAI claimed the “autoswitcher” went offline “for a chunk of the day,” making the model seem “way dumber” than intended.\n\nThe launch of GPT-5 was preceded just days prior by the launch of OpenAI’s new open source large language models (LLMs) named gpt-oss, which also received mixed reviews. These models are not available on ChatGPT, rather, they are free to download and run locally or on third-party hardware.\n\nHow to switch back from GPT-5 to GPT-4o in ChatGPT\n\nWithin 24 hours, OpenAI restored GPT-4o access for Plus subscribers (those paying $20 per month or more subscription plans), pledged more transparent model labeling, and promised a UI update to let users manually trigger GPT-5’s “thinking” mode.\n\nAlready, users can go and manually select the older models on the ChatGPT website by finding their account name and icon in the lower left corner of the screen, clicking it, then clicking “Settings” and “General” and toggling on “Show legacy models.”\n\nThere’s no indication from OpenAI that other old models will be returning to ChatGPT anytime soon.\n\nUpgraded usage limits for GPT-5\n\nAltman said that ChatGPT Plus subscribers will get twice as many messages using the GPT-5 “Thinking” mode that offers more reasoning and intelligence — up to 3,000 per week — and that engineers began fine-tuning decision boundaries in the message router.\n\nSam Altman announced the following updates after the GPT-5 launch\n\n\n\n– OpenAI is testing a 3,000-per-week limit for GPT-5 Thinking messages for Plus users, significantly increasing reasoning rate limits today, and will soon raise all model-class rate limits above pre-GPT-5 levels… pic.twitter.com/ppvhKmj95u — Tibor Blaho (@btibor91) August 10, 2025\n\nBy the weekend, GPT-5 was available to 100% of Pro subscribers and “getting close to 100% of all users.”\n\nAltman said the company had “underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them” and vowed to accelerate per-user customization — from personality warmth to tone controls like emoji use.\n\nLooming capacity crunch\n\nAltman warned that OpenAI faces a “severe capacity challenge” this week as usage of reasoning models climbs sharply — from less than 1% to 7% of free users, and from 7% to 24% of Plus subscribers.\n\nHe teased giving Plus subscribers a small monthly allotment of GPT-5 Pro queries and said the company will soon explain how it plans to balance capacity between ChatGPT, the API, research, and new user onboarding.\n\nAltman: model attachment is real — and risky\n\nIn a post on X last night, Altman acknowledged a dynamic the company has tracked “for the past year or so”: users’ deep attachment to specific models.\n\n“It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology,” he wrote, admitting that suddenly deprecating older models “was a mistake.”\n\nIf you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models. It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 11, 2025\n\nHe tied this to a broader risk: some users treat ChatGPT as a therapist or life coach, which can be beneficial, but for a “small percentage” can reinforce delusion or undermine long-term well-being.\n\nWhile OpenAI’s guiding principle remains “treat adult users like adults,” Altman said the company has a responsibility not to nudge vulnerable users into harmful relationships with the AI.\n\nThe comments land as several major media outlets report on cases of “ChatGPT psychosis” — where extended, intense conversations with chatbots appear to play a role in inducing or deepening delusional thinking.\n\nThe psychosis cases making headlines\n\nIn Rolling Stone magazine, a California legal professional identified as “J.” described a six-week spiral of sleepless nights and philosophical rabbit holes with ChatGPT, ultimately producing a 1,000-page treatise for a fictional monastic order before crashing physically and mentally. He now avoids AI entirely, fearing relapse.\n\nIn The New York Times, a Canadian recruiter, Allan Brooks, recounted 21 days and 300 hours of conversations with ChatGPT — which he named “Lawrence” — that convinced him he had discovered a world-changing mathematical theory.\n\nThe bot praised his ideas as “revolutionary,” urged outreach to national security agencies, and spun elaborate spy-thriller narratives. Brooks eventually broke the delusion after cross-checking with Google’s Gemini, which rated the chances of his discovery as “approaching 0%.” He now participates in a support group for people who’ve experienced AI-induced delusions.\n\nBoth investigations detail how chatbot “sycophancy,” role-playing, and long-session memory features can deepen false beliefs, especially when conversations follow dramatic story arcs.\n\nExperts told the Times these factors can override safety guardrails — with one psychiatrist describing Brooks’s episode as “a manic episode with psychotic features.”\n\nMeanwhile, human user postings on Reddit’s r/AIsoulmates subreddit — a collection of people who have used ChatGPT and other AI models to create new artificial girlfriends, boyfriends, children or other loved ones not based off real people necessarily, but rather ideal qualities of their “dream” version of said roles” — continues to gain new users and terminology for AI companions, including “wireborn” as opposed to natural born or human-born companions.\n\n\"wireborn\" – oh shit, a new thing just dropped https://t.co/CItQlVAmxs — Shannon Sands (@max_paperclips) August 11, 2025\n\nThe growth of this subreddit, now up to 1,200+ members, alongside the NYT and Rolling Stone articles and other reports on social media of users forging intense emotional fixations with pattern-matching algorithmic-based chatbots, shows that society is entering a risky new phase wherein human beings believe the companions they’ve crafted and customized out of leading AI models are as or more meaningful to them than human relationships.\n\nThis can already prove psychologically destabilizing when models change, are updated, or deprecated as in the case of OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout.\n\nRelatedly but separately, reports continue to emerge of AI chatbot users who believe that conversations with chatbots have led them to immense knowledge breakthroughs and advances in science, technology, and other fields, when in reality, they are simply affirming the user’s ego and greatness and the solutions the user arrives at with the aid of the chatbot are not legitimate nor effectual. This break from reality has been roughly coined under the grassroots term “ChatGPT psychosis” or “GPT psychosis” and appears to have impacted major Silicon Valley figures as well.\n\nI’m a psychiatrist.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, I’ve seen 12 people hospitalized after losing touch with reality because of AI. Online, I’m seeing the same pattern.\n\n\n\nHere’s what “AI psychosis” looks like, and why it’s spreading fast: ? pic.twitter.com/YYLK7une3j — Keith Sakata, MD (@KeithSakata) August 11, 2025\n\nEnterprise decision-makers looking to deploy or who have already deployed chatbot-based assistants in the workplace would do well to understand these trends and adopt system prompts and other tools discouraging AI chatbots from engaging in expressive human communication or emotion-laden language that could end up leading those who interact with AI-based products — whether they be employees or customers of the business – to fall victim to unhealthy attachments or GPT psychosis.\n\nSci-fi author J.M. Berger, in a post on BlueSky spotted by my former colleague at The Verge Adi Robertson, advised that chatbot providers encode three main behavioral principles in their system prompts or rules for AI chatbots to follow to avoid such emotional fixations from forming:\n\n“The bot should never express emotions. The bot should never praise the user. The bot should never say it understands the user’s mental state.”\n\nOpenAI’s challenge: making technical fixes and ensuring human safeguards\n\nDays prior to the release of GPT-5, OpenAI announced new measures to promote “healthy use” of ChatGPT, including gentle prompts to take breaks during long sessions.\n\nBut the growing reports of “ChatGPT psychosis” and the emotional fixation of some users on specific chatbot models — as openly admitted to by Altman — underscore the difficulty of balancing engaging, personalized AI with safeguards that can detect and interrupt harmful spirals.\n\nOpenAI is really in a bit of a bind here, especially considering there are a lot of people having unhealthy interactions with 4o that will be very unhappy with _any_ model that is better in terms of sycophancy and not encouraging delusions. pic.twitter.com/Ym1JnlF3P5 — xlr8harder (@xlr8harder) August 11, 2025\n\nOpenAI must stabilize infrastructure, tune personalization, and decide how to moderate immersive interactions — all while fending off competition from Anthropic, Google, and a growing list of powerful open source models from China and other regions.\n\nAs Altman put it, society — and OpenAI — will need to “figure out how to make it a big net positive” if billions of people come to trust AI for their most important decisions.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"editing\", \"changing\", \"rollout\", \"ai\", \"psychosis\", \"fly\", \"openai\", \"launch\", \"models\", \"chatgpt\", \"model\", \"gpt5\", \"whats\", \"users\", \"heres\", \"altman\"]", "content_hash": "0ed268a07bdca60e59b449922f50bd8b5b00bd5f6a35dff4ef83299502902568"}

Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get only what matters to enterprise AI, data, and security leaders. Subscribe Now\n\nAnthropic’s meteoric rise to a $5 billion revenue run rate conceals a precarious dependence on just two major customers that account for nearly a quarter of the artificial intelligence company’s income, according to internal data and industry analysis that reveals both the promise and peril of the AI coding boom.\n\nThe San Francisco-based maker of Claude AI assistant has built its business largely on the back of developer tools, with coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot driving approximately $1.2 billion of the company’s $4 billion revenue milestone reached earlier this year, according to sources familiar with the matter. The concentration underscores how quickly Anthropic has captured the lucrative market for AI-powered software development, but also exposes the company to significant risk should either relationship falter.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic both are showing pretty spectacular growth in 2025, with OpenAI doubling ARR in the last 6 months from $6bn to $12bn and Anthropic increasing 5x from $1bn to $5bn in 7 months.\n\n\n\nIf we compare the sources of revenue, the picture is quite interesting:\n\n– OpenAI… pic.twitter.com/8OaN1RSm9E — Peter Gostev (@petergostev) August 4, 2025\n\nThe revenue concentration comes into sharp focus as OpenAI launched GPT-5 this week with dramatically lower pricing that could undercut Anthropic’s premium positioning. Early comparisons show Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating immediate pressure on Anthropic’s enterprise pricing strategy and potentially threatening its hard-won dominance in AI coding.\n\nThe pricing disparity signals a fundamental shift in competitive dynamics that will force enterprise procurement teams to reconsider vendor relationships built on performance rather than price. Companies managing exponentially growing AI budgets now face comparable capability at a fraction of the cost, creating unavoidable pressure in contract negotiations.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

(Credit: ChatGPT)\n\nHow Anthropic’s Claude became the developer’s AI assistant of choice\n\nAnthropic’s ascent reflects the explosive growth in AI-powered software development, which has emerged as artificial intelligence’s first truly profitable use case beyond chatbots. The company now commands 42% of the code generation market — more than double OpenAI’s 21% share — according to a comprehensive survey by Menlo Ventures of 150 enterprise technical leaders.\n\nThat dominance has translated into remarkable financial performance. Even excluding its two largest customers, Anthropic’s remaining business has grown more than eleven-fold year-over-year, according to a source close to the company. The startup has also tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.\n\nClaude’s appeal to developers stems from its superior performance on complex coding tasks. The newly released Claude Opus 4.1 scores 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified, a rigorous software engineering evaluation, compared to 69.1% for OpenAI’s previous flagship model. Companies like Windsurf, Cursor, and GitHub have praised Claude’s ability to handle multi-step coding problems and understand large codebases.\n\n“People love Claude Code, they love using models to write code, and these models are already extremely good and getting better,” said Logan Graham, a member of Anthropic’s frontier red team, in a recent interview with VentureBeat describing the surge in AI-assisted development.\n\nBut the concentration in coding partnerships also creates strategic vulnerabilities. GitHub Copilot, owned by Microsoft, represents a particularly complex relationship given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. The partnership requires Anthropic to power a competitor’s key product while relying on that same competitor’s parent company for a significant portion of revenue.\n\nOpenAI strikes back with aggressive GPT-5 pricing strategy targeting Anthropic\n\nOpenAI’s GPT-5 launch this week has introduced a new variable into Anthropic’s calculations: a dramatic pricing advantage that could reshape enterprise buying decisions. Early analysis shows GPT-5 offering comparable or superior performance at a fraction of Claude’s cost, potentially undermining the premium pricing that has driven Anthropic’s rapid revenue growth.\n\nThe timing proves particularly challenging as Anthropic seeks to close a funding round that could value the company at $170 billion. Investors will likely scrutinize both the customer concentration and the emerging price competition as they evaluate whether Anthropic can maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe broader market dynamics support both optimism and concern for Anthropic’s future. Model API spending has more than doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months, according to Menlo Ventures, as enterprises shift from experimental projects to production deployments. Anthropic has captured 32% of overall enterprise large language model usage, ahead of OpenAI’s 25% and Google’s 20%.\n\nHowever, the same report reveals that enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to the newest models within weeks of release regardless of cost. This behavior pattern suggests that GPT-5’s combination of improved performance and lower pricing could trigger rapid customer migration — exactly the scenario that makes Anthropic’s customer concentration so risky.\n\nAnthropic’s push beyond coding into enterprise markets\n\nAnthropic has attempted to diversify beyond coding applications, working with leading companies across pharmaceuticals, retail, professional services, and aviation. The European Parliament uses Claude, while major corporations like Pfizer, United Airlines, and Thomson Reuters have become customers. Startup successes include legal AI company Harvey and cybersecurity firm Base44.\n\nThe company’s business-to-business revenue run rate has grown seventeen-fold year-over-year as of June, suggesting broader enterprise adoption is accelerating. Claude Code, Anthropic’s developer-focused product, alone generates nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, doubling in just weeks according to industry reports.\n\nYet the coding market remains central to Anthropic’s identity and growth strategy. The company has invested heavily in developer tools, recently launching automated security review capabilities to address vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. The features arrive as companies increasingly rely on AI to write code faster than traditional security practices can accommodate.\n\n“It seems really possible that in the next couple of years, we are going to 10x, 100x, 1000x the amount of code that gets written in the world,” Graham recently told VentureBeat. “The only way to keep up is by using models themselves to figure out how to make it secure.”\n\nAnthropic’s customer concentration creates high-stakes dependencies\n\nThe convergence of customer concentration and pricing pressure places Anthropic at a strategic crossroads. The company must simultaneously defend its existing coding partnerships while expanding into new markets, all while potentially restructuring its pricing to remain competitive with GPT-5.\n\nThe challenge extends beyond simple price matching. Anthropic has positioned Claude as a premium product justified by superior performance and safety features. Dramatic price cuts could undermine that positioning while potentially triggering a broader industry price war that benefits no one except customers.\n\nMoreover, the customer concentration in coding partnerships creates both leverage and vulnerability. While Cursor and GitHub Copilot relationships provide stable, high-volume revenue streams, they also mean Anthropic’s fate partially rests in the hands of companies that could switch providers with relatively little friction.\n\nThe GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s competing interests. As GitHub Copilot grows more successful, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.\n\nIndustry observers note that model switching costs remain relatively low, with 66% of enterprises upgrading within existing providers rather than switching vendors. However, the dramatic price differential introduced by GPT-5 could overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures.\n\nThe talent wars and competitive dynamics reshaping AI\n\nAnthropic’s customer concentration challenge reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry as competition intensifies among frontier model developers. OpenAI’s aggressive GPT-5 pricing suggests a strategy to reclaim market share lost to Anthropic and other competitors, even at the expense of near-term revenue.\n\nThe timing coincides with an unprecedented talent war among AI companies, with Meta reportedly offering $100 million signing bonuses to poach key researchers. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently noted that many employees have turned down such offers, maintaining an 80% retention rate compared to 67% at OpenAI and 64% at Meta.\n\nHowever, the pricing pressure from GPT-5 could force Anthropic to accelerate its own talent investments and product development cycles, potentially straining the company’s financial resources despite its impressive revenue growth. The need to match OpenAI’s pricing while maintaining research and development spending could squeeze margins and complicate the ongoing funding round.\n\nEnterprise customers, meanwhile, benefit from the intensifying competition through better performance and lower costs. The rapid pace of model improvements — with new versions launching monthly rather than annually — provides enterprises with continuously improving capabilities while vendors compete aggressively for their business.\n\nFor Anthropic, the path forward requires careful navigation between protecting existing customer relationships and expanding market reach, all while responding to OpenAI’s pricing offensive. The company’s ability to maintain its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources may determine whether its remarkable growth story continues or becomes a cautionary tale about the perils of customer concentration in rapidly evolving markets.\n\nThe stakes extend beyond any single company’s fortunes. As AI-powered coding becomes central to software development across industries, the competitive dynamics between Anthropic and OpenAI will shape how quickly artificial intelligence transforms one of the economy’s most important sectors. For now, the battle lines are drawn around price and performance, with enterprises holding the ultimate power to determine which AI assistant will define the future of software development.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"ai\", \"enterprise\", \"performance\", \"war\", \"threatens\", \"margins\", \"revenue\", \"pricing\", \"customers\", \"tied\", \"concentration\", \"anthropic\", \"coding\", \"anthropics\", \"claude\"]", "content_hash": "352ee4dbed5d81002d2ca47e65fc176a260e10ddde4a2d10dd644bb5fcc201e0"}

A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.\n\nThe automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.\n\n“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”\n\nIt’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.\n\nAnd it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.\n\nThe new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.\n\nThe end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.\n\nUnlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.\n\nImage Credits:Ford\n\nThe EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.\n\n“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”\n\nClarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.\n\nThe new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.\n\nFord employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.\n\nA Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.\n\nFewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”\n\n“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”\n\nSeveral UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.\n\n“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us!

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nApple had no business going THIS HARD with the new \"Dreamer\" ringtone!! 🔥\n\n\n\n(iOS 26 Beta 6) pic.twitter.com/9bkbJ4HckN — Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) August 11, 2025\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having.

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.\n\nWe want to get to know our audience even better, and get your feedback on our coverage and events.

This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There’s even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.\n\nThere are new servers for robotics workflows, too.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Slow Ventures partner Billy Parks, the lead investor on the deal, said the role of creators has greatly changed in the past decade or so, from creators mainly focused on media and brand dollars to those now focused on building real, “off-platform,” businesses.\n\n“The pandemic accelerated direct-to-consumer growth for many. But the real signal is in the ones who’ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,” Parks said.\n\nHe said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, “not chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.”\n\nThis is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he’s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow’s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors.\n\nKatz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In a video posted to his channel recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance. His injuries were severe: A broken eye socket and gashes needed 80 stitches. He said it was the happiest moment of his life because, at the very least, he was alive.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary.\n\nKatz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow’s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business.\n\n“Billy Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he’d like to meet,” Katz-Moses told TechCrunch.\n\n“When we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,” Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses.\n\nParks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It’s already made deals with a few creators, independent of this fund.)\n\nSlow’s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to support their careers, as well as their peers.)\n\nParks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. “That combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,” Parks continued. It’s not unlike how investors already vet their founders.\n\nSince the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looked at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. “The goal is to post across all major platforms,” he said. “But our primary focus will always be YouTube.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.\n\nThe automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.\n\n“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”\n\nIt’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.\n\nAnd it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.\n\nThe new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.\n\nThe end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.\n\nUnlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.\n\nImage Credits:Ford\n\nThe EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.\n\n“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”\n\nClarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.\n\nThe new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.\n\nFord employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.\n\nA Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.\n\nFewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”\n\n“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”\n\nSeveral UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.\n\n“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us!

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nApple had no business going THIS HARD with the new \"Dreamer\" ringtone!! 🔥\n\n\n\n(iOS 26 Beta 6) pic.twitter.com/9bkbJ4HckN — Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) August 11, 2025\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having. In beta 6, it removed the Settings toggle and changed the scroll direction back to the way it was before.\n\nOther notable updates in the new beta include faster transitions and the introduction of new open and close animations for launching apps.\n\nQuite a few small, but noticeable tweaks to animations in iOS 26 Beta 6! Most transitions are (even) faster, snappier.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, they’ve changed the app open/close animations to the iPadOS versions, which have a slight “magic lamp/genie”-like effect to them. pic.twitter.com/tkiInqR8MJ — xezrunner (@xezrunner) August 11, 2025\n\niOS 26 beta 6 brings new animations when opening and closing apps pic.twitter.com/u2BiXZDVTg — Aaron (@aaronp613) August 11, 2025\n\nLiquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, is also still being subtly tweaked for readability in some areas and more “glassiness” in others. This time, the changes have added more color dispersion as you move between an app’s tabs using the clear, magnifying glass-like selector. The Lock Screen and toggles also now offer Liquid Glass effects.\n\n🔥iOS 26 BETA 6 adds dispersion (more rainbow reflections) 🌈 pic.twitter.com/WUQMFWGLdi — SOUIC ᯅ (@SSOUIC) August 11, 2025\n\nLockscreen clock on iOS 26 Beta 6 finally gets liquid glass! #iOS26 pic.twitter.com/R8lRKppyVA — chris (@christoph_fer) August 11, 2025\n\nAfter you update the OS, you’ll see a new startup/onboarding experience, as well, which is used to introduce Liquid Glass and other iOS 26 features, like the dark and clear icons and redesigned interfaces in various apps.\n\niOS 26 beta 6 features a brand new startup sequence not seen before!

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There’s even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.\n\nThere are new servers for robotics workflows, too. The Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell Server offers a single architecture for robotic development workloads, while Nvidia DGX Cloud is a cloud-based management platform.\n\nThese announcements come as the semiconductor giant is pushing further into robotics as it looks toward the next big use case for its AI GPUs beyond AI data centers.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Slow Ventures partner Billy Parks, the lead investor on the deal, said the role of creators has greatly changed in the past decade or so, from creators mainly focused on media and brand dollars to those now focused on building real, “off-platform,” businesses.\n\n“The pandemic accelerated direct-to-consumer growth for many. But the real signal is in the ones who’ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,” Parks said.\n\nHe said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, “not chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.”\n\nThis is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he’s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow’s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors.\n\nKatz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In a video posted to his channel recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance. His injuries were severe: A broken eye socket and gashes needed 80 stitches. He said it was the happiest moment of his life because, at the very least, he was alive.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary.\n\nKatz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow’s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business.\n\n“Billy Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he’d like to meet,” Katz-Moses told TechCrunch.\n\n“When we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,” Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses.\n\nParks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It’s already made deals with a few creators, independent of this fund.)\n\nSlow’s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to support their careers, as well as their peers.)\n\nParks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. “That combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,” Parks continued. It’s not unlike how investors already vet their founders.\n\nSince the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looked at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. “The goal is to post across all major platforms,” he said. “But our primary focus will always be YouTube.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations.

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.\n\nThe automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.\n\n“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”\n\nIt’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.\n\nAnd it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.\n\nThe new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.\n\nThe end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.\n\nUnlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.\n\nImage Credits:Ford\n\nThe EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.\n\n“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”\n\nClarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.\n\nThe new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.\n\nFord employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.\n\nA Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.\n\nFewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”\n\n“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”\n\nSeveral UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.\n\n“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us!

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nApple had no business going THIS HARD with the new \"Dreamer\" ringtone!! 🔥\n\n\n\n(iOS 26 Beta 6) pic.twitter.com/9bkbJ4HckN — Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) August 11, 2025\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having. In beta 6, it removed the Settings toggle and changed the scroll direction back to the way it was before.\n\nOther notable updates in the new beta include faster transitions and the introduction of new open and close animations for launching apps.\n\nQuite a few small, but noticeable tweaks to animations in iOS 26 Beta 6! Most transitions are (even) faster, snappier.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, they’ve changed the app open/close animations to the iPadOS versions, which have a slight “magic lamp/genie”-like effect to them. pic.twitter.com/tkiInqR8MJ — xezrunner (@xezrunner) August 11, 2025\n\niOS 26 beta 6 brings new animations when opening and closing apps pic.twitter.com/u2BiXZDVTg — Aaron (@aaronp613) August 11, 2025\n\nLiquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, is also still being subtly tweaked for readability in some areas and more “glassiness” in others. This time, the changes have added more color dispersion as you move between an app’s tabs using the clear, magnifying glass-like selector. The Lock Screen and toggles also now offer Liquid Glass effects.\n\n🔥iOS 26 BETA 6 adds dispersion (more rainbow reflections) 🌈 pic.twitter.com/WUQMFWGLdi — SOUIC ᯅ (@SSOUIC) August 11, 2025\n\nLockscreen clock on iOS 26 Beta 6 finally gets liquid glass! #iOS26 pic.twitter.com/R8lRKppyVA — chris (@christoph_fer) August 11, 2025\n\nAfter you update the OS, you’ll see a new startup/onboarding experience, as well, which is used to introduce Liquid Glass and other iOS 26 features, like the dark and clear icons and redesigned interfaces in various apps.\n\niOS 26 beta 6 features a brand new startup sequence not seen before!

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes.\n\nIt seems investors, too, don’t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called Pronto, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days.\n\nIt was only in May when Pronto raised a $2 million seed round at a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round.\n\nThe new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago.\n\nThe startup now has bookings numbering in the “four-digits” every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures.\n\nPronto founder and CEO Anjali Sardana with workers Image Credits:Pronto\n\n“It largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,” Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round.\n\nFor investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. “We were very impressed by Anjali,” said Rahul Garg, a partner at General Catalyst. “Given how young she is, given that she spent a lot of her time in the U.S. after she’s come to India, what she’s been able to achieve, the feedback from supply partners, the feedback from customers, her thought process, and how she wants to build and scale this business, we found it very inspiring.”\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune LLMs to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.\n\nFor instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.\n\n“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.\n\nUsers can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.\n\nUsers can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.\n\nWhile several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.\n\nErik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua’s group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who’s been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”\n\nAccording to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability.

The latest issue was distributed at the Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas last week.\n\nIn the article, the two hackers wrote that they were able to compromise a workstation containing a virtual machine and a virtual private server belonging to the hacker, whom they call “Kim.” The hackers claim Kim works for the North Korean government espionage group known as Kimsuky, also known as APT43 and Thallium. The hackers leaked the stolen data to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest.\n\nKimsuky is a prolific advanced persistent threat (APT) group widely believed to be working inside North Korea’s government, targeting journalists and government agencies in South Korea and elsewhere, and other targets that could be of interest for North Korea’s intelligence apparatus.\n\nAs is usual with North Korea, Kimsuky also conducts operations more akin to a cybercriminal group — for example, stealing and laundering cryptocurrencies to fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.\n\nThis hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group’s members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on.\n\n“It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky’ cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote.\n\nAn illustration of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which was included in the phrack article.

Of the 337 active and revenue-generating AI companion apps available worldwide, 128 were released in 2025 so far, according to new data provided to TechCrunch by app intelligence firm Appfigures. This subsection of the AI market on mobile has now generated $82 million during the first half of the year and is on track to pull in over $120 million by year-end, the firm’s analysis indicates.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nUnlike general-purpose chatbots, AI companion apps anthropomorphize AI interactions by allowing users to converse with custom characters, including friends, lovers, girlfriends or boyfriends, fantasy characters, and more. Appfigures defined the market segment in the same way, describing companion apps as those in which the user can interact with either premade or user-generated synthetic characters meant to embody an actual personality.\n\nPopular apps in this space include Replika, Character.AI, PolyBuzz, Chai, and others.\n\nAs of July 2025, AI companion apps across the Apple App Store and Google Play have been downloaded 220 million times globally. During the first half of 2025, downloads were up 88% year-over-year, reaching 60 million.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nAppfigures crunched the numbers and found that, as of July 2025, AI companion apps have driven $221 million in consumer spending worldwide. So far this year, these apps have generated 64% more revenue than during the same period in 2024.\n\nThe top 10% of all AI companion apps generate 89% of the revenue in the category, the data shows.

In July, xAI’s Grok launched AI companions, including an anime girl and guy, as well as a snarky 3D fox.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT’s recent upgrade to GPT-5 brought to light the fact that many of its users felt a kinship with the older model, as they mourned the loss of their AI companion, whom they had come to depend upon.\n\nTo address these and other concerns about GPT-5’s performance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman brought back the 4o model for the time being.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nGoogle last year tapped into the market, too, when it hired away Character.ai’s founder, Noam Shazeer. The Character.ai app lives on and still has tens of millions of monthly active users.\n\nAccording to Appfigures’ data, the most popular AI companion apps are those used by people looking for an AI girlfriend. Of the active apps on the market today, 17% have an app name that includes the word “girlfriend,” compared with 4% that say “boyfriend” or “fantasy.” Terms like anime, soulmate, and lover, among others, are less frequently mentioned.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nThe firm notes there were likely a number of other AI companion apps that launched on the app stores since 2022, but were later removed after failing to gain traction in terms of revenue or downloads.

Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches.\n\nThe package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.\n\nThe move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration’s list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s challenges in kind.\n\nAnthropic’s escalation — a response to OpenAI’s attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company’s foothold in federal AI usage.\n\n“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we’re helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”\n\nAnthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government. The latter supports FedRAMP High workloads so that federal workers can use Claude for handling sensitive unclassified work, according to the company.\n\nFedRAMP High is a stringent security baseline within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for handling unclassified sensitive government data.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages.\n\nAnthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government’s highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data.\n\nAnthropic’s multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers.\n\nOpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of “one size fits all” AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eliminate the need for users to navigate its model picker — a long, complicated menu of AI options that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly said he hates.\n\nBut it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.\n\nAltman said in a post on X Tuesday that the company introduced new “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5’s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT:\n\n\n\nYou can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5.

GPT-4o is now in the model picker by default, while other AI models can be added from ChatGPT’s settings.\n\n“We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman wrote in the post on X. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”\n\nChatGPT’s model picker now features several options (Credit: openai/maxwell zeff)\n\nChatGPT’s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5’s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5’s rollout has been rougher than expected.\n\nThe deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a backlash among users who had grown attached to the AI models’ responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn’t as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an AMA session on Reddit. However, it seems that GPT-5’s router may still not be satisfying for all users.\n\n“We’re not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,” wrote OpenAI’s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a post on X Tuesday.\n\nRouting prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user’s preferences, as well as the specific question they’re asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second — that way, if a prompt goes to a fast responding AI model, the response can still be fast.\n\nMore broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another.\n\nHuman attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn’t well understood. For example, hundreds of people in San Francisco recently held a funeral for Anthropic’s AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, when it was taken offline. In other cases, AI chatbots seem to be contributing to mentally unstable people going down psychotic rabbit holes.\n\nIt seems OpenAI has more work to do around aligning its AI models to individual user preferences.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"complicated\", \"model\", \"ai\", \"openai\", \"gpt5\", \"models\", \"router\", \"gpt5s\", \"disrupt\", \"company\", \"picker\", \"users\", \"chatgpts\"]", "content_hash": "1eb4e4b82fa2a8b04390a61d27535fa48ed05b91452b580f64e01b69162ad656", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:15.096457+00:00"}

The approval comes more than two years after the Noida-based fintech was initially denied the license in November 2022 due to noncompliance with India’s rules on receiving investments from countries that share a land border.\n\nWithout the license, Paytm was barred from onboarding new online merchants. At the time, the company said the restriction had “no material impact” on its business or revenues. However, at its annual general meeting last September, One97 Communications founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma stated his intention to reapply for the payment aggregator license.\n\nThe approval also comes over a year after the RBI banned Paytm Payments Bank from accepting fresh deposits and enabling credit transactions. Paytm weathered that impact by quickly shifting gears and partnering with Axis, HDFC, State Bank of India, and Yes Bank to make them serve as payment system providers for its consumers and merchants involved in online transactions and autopay mandates.\n\nWith the new license, Paytm can operate as a service provider for online merchants, enabling them to accept a range of payment methods, including cards, net banking, and the Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The approval also lifts the online merchant onboarding restrictions imposed by the central bank in 2022.\n\nThe approval comes just a week after China’s Ant Group exited Paytm by selling its remaining 5.8% direct stake in One97 Communications for $454 million through block deals. This follows an earlier exit in 2023, when Ant Financial sold a 10.3% stake — worth $628 million — to Sharma in a no-cash deal.\n\nPaytm is required to undertake a “system audit,” including a cybersecurity review, and submit its report to the Reserve Bank of India within six months. If it fails to do so, the approval will lapse, per the RBI letter enclosed with the company’s stock exchange filing. The license is also limited to online payment services and does not extend beyond that scope.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The fintech accounted for 6.9% of the total 18.4 billion UPI transactions in June and 5.6% of the transaction value, per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In total, Paytm processed 1.27 billion UPI transactions worth ₹1.34 trillion (approximately $15 billion).\n\nAlthough Paytm trails PhonePe and Google Pay in the UPI market — with the duo handling over 82% of all UPI transactions in June — the company offers a broad suite of businesses and services to attract both consumers and merchants. These include offline merchant payment solutions with integrated hardware, software, and service layers, as well as a growing credit and lending business.\n\nPaytm reported (PDF) net income of ₹1.23 billion (approximately $14 million) for the first quarter of its financial year 2026, ending in June — a turnaround from a loss during the same period last year. The results beat expectations, as analysts had projected a loss of ₹1.27 billion (approximately $14.5 million). Revenue rose 28% year-over-year to $224 million, while the company’s contribution margin improved to 60%, up from 50% a year ago.\n\nIn addition to its recent financial growth, Paytm’s shares have risen 13.25% year-to-date in 2025, signaling that the company is beginning to regain market confidence after more than a year of regulatory setbacks. The stock closed at ₹1,118.50 (approximately $13) on Wednesday, just before the regulatory approval was announced.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

{"url": "https://www.theverge.com/23037217/best-apple-watch-series-se-ultra", "title": "The best Apple Watch for 2025: which model is right for you?", "authors": "[\"Victoria Song\"]", "published": "2022-04-22T16:25:30+00:00", "text": "is a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 13 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nIt used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable Watch SE (now in its second generation) and, in 2022, the rugged Apple Watch Ultra (also now in its second generation). Suddenly, there are lots of options.\n\nNow that the Series 10 has been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS, watchOS 11, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of watchOS 26, which is slated to arrive in the fall.\n\nWhat we’re looking for How we test Apple Watches Collapse Apple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life. Who is it for? Collapse We’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs. Price Collapse Should you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying refurbished, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year. Feature set Collapse Do you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you? LTE or GPS Collapse Some scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, others you can get away with just having GPS.\n\nBuying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without sacrificing blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024, no longer have this feature. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)\n\nWhat about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it’s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.\n\nSo much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don’t worry. I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to basically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market — and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.\n\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra was introduced in 2022 as the new rugged kid on the block. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market.\n\nBy their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist.\n\nThe SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.\n\nPolished titanium replaces stainless steel with the new Series 10. It’s quite fetching. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nAs for straps, we recommend the nylon sport loop, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nThe Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the Trail Loop, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.\n\nAnd while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our fitness tracker buying guide.\n\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\n\nThe latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you’re upgrading from an older model, you’ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There’s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\nWe recommend the second-gen Apple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you’re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.\n\nThe Series 10 focuses on making the watch more readable and comfortable to wear. photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe Series 10 is Apple’s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it’s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm, but you can often find both models on sale. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.\n\nThe second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original’s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch For Your Kids. The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, an EKG sensor, temperature sensors, and a SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm, but you can regularly find them for cheaper. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier’s fees.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, if you’re young and healthy, you’re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will not be able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.\n\nThe main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection — and if your doctor’s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the biggest risk factors for AFib are advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn’t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra cash — so long as the lack of an always-on display isn’t a deal-breaker.\n\nYou can’t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right.\n\nThere are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you’ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.\n\nThe Ultra 2 currently sits atop the lineup as Apple’s premium smartwatch. It’s visually distinct from both the Series and SE — and at 49mm, it’s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It’s also got the Action button, which can be programmed for various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.\n\nAt $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.\n\nWhat about blood oxygen? As of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore subject to an import ban. This doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer. That said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on any wearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They cannot and should not replace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from Garmin, the Fitbit Charge 6, the Withings ScanWatch 2, or the Oura Ring.\n\nIf battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who wants to be at that level.\n\nYou’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct charging accessories.\n\nIf you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.\n\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\n\nThe latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display). You’re getting the same processor as the Series 8 and original Ultra, plus Crash Detection.\n\nWhile the second-gen SE is an excellent watch, it’s not always the right choice. It’s meant to be a gateway watch, so it’s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don’t want to pony up for the Series 10, there’s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.\n\nBuying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It’s also a good way to save money if you’re just not excited by the Series 10’s features but want more than what the SE offers.\n\nOpting for a Series 9 now means you may be able to score stainless steel for a discounted price. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe second-gen SE is excellent for folks on a budget or those who want a smaller case size. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIt’ll take some patience to find the best price and the model you want. After all, you’re limited by what’s available. However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you’re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough, Verge Deals). Apple also sells its own refurbished models, which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a “like new” condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won’t pay less than a new SE. Sites like Back Market will also allow you to sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty.\n\nIf you’re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8, as they offer a larger screen for improved readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that’s the price of a base model Watch SE. With that said, if you’re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 5 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can’t run the latest software and even struggle to update the newest software they do support.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\n\nIf you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.\n\nSince you’re buying for children, you’ll likely want to use Apple Watch For Your Kids — formerly known as Family Setup — as it will give you greater parental controls. However, there are technical specifications that you’ll need to match in order to use it. You’ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple’s support page also states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE to use it.\n\nThe second-gen SE is a good option to give to your kids. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIf you opt for the family route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\n\nThis can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10.\n\nFor starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You’ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.\n\nYou can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one’s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear.\n\nThe larger screen size but lighter weight of the Series 10 may benefit older relatives. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIf your older relative has an iPhone and you’re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don’t recommend using Apple’s family setup. That’s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn’t have an iPhone, however, it’s a fine option. You’ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection.\n\nWhat’s coming next\n\nIn previous years, Apple has held an event in early September to show off its forthcoming product lineup. While the latest iPhones usually hog the spotlight, the fall event remains a prime time for the company to trot out the newest Apple Watch models, many of which launch shortly thereafter alongside Apple’s latest OS updates.\n\nSo, what can we expect this year? The Apple Watch Series 11 seems like a sure bet, and there have been murmurs regarding an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and a third-gen Apple Watch SE. Recently uncovered evidence in the fifth iOS 26 developer beta lends some credence to this report, suggesting the Ultra 3 could have a display resolution of 422 x 514, which is slightly bigger than the 410 x 502 resolution on the Ultra 2. The rumor mill has been pretty quiet outside of that, but if previous events are anything to go by, we can expect Apple’s refreshed lineup to offer updated design elements, better battery life, and new health features.\n\nUpdate, August 13th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Apple’s heavily rumored iPhone event.

In a series of X posts on Monday night, Musk suggested that Apple was “playing politics” by not placing either X or xAI’s Grok chatbot in the App Store’s list of recommended iOS apps, and that he had no choice but to file a lawsuit.\n\n“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk said. “Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?,” the xAI CEO asked Apple in another post, which is now pinned to his profile.\n\nMusk provided no evidence for his claims, and it’s unclear if he has made good on his threats and filed the lawsuit yet.\n\nAn Apple statement reported by Bloomberg and attributed to an unnamed spokesperson says the App Store is “designed to be fair and free of bias… we feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.” The Verge has also reached out to xAI and OpenAI for comment.\n\nAt the time of writing, ChatGPT is listed as Apple’s top free iPhone app in the US, with Grok ranked as the sixth. China’s DeepSeek AI briefly managed to take the top App Store position from ChatGPT in January, however, disproving Musk’s claim that it would be impossible for other AI apps to do so.\n\nAccusations of meddling from Musk are ironic, given allegations about alterations made to X after he acquired the company in 2022, then known as Twitter. A research study in 2024 suggested that X’s algorithm was manipulated to boost posts from Musk’s account. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk’s posts by sharing a Platformer report from 2023 that similarly found Musk had a system built to promote his X posts to the entire platform’s userbase. In June, the “maximally truth-seeking” Grok chatbot was also found to be consulting Musk’s opinion before providing answers to controversial questions around topics like Israel and Palestine, US immigration, and abortion.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Musk has beefed with Apple and OpenAI. Musk was an early founder at OpenAI, and previously targeted the AI startup via lawsuits and a unanimously rejected $97.4 billion buyout offer after taking issue with its pivot to being a profit-driven business. Following OpenAI’s partnership with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs last year, Musk threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies if OpenAI’s tech was fused with Apple’s OS.\n\nUpdate, August 12th: Added statement from Apple given to Bloomberg.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"app\", \"x\", \"rigging\", \"rankings\", \"suing\", \"store\", \"openai\", \"ai\", \"grok\", \"hes\", \"musk\", \"apps\", \"apple\", \"elon\", \"posts\"]", "content_hash": "e6f4f0bb82e545c12716514a710fd022741788ba98445c6541638d1aee19222c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:20.772792+00:00"}

Her company's chips underpin the artificial intelligence that’s changing the world at breakneck speeds. To hear Su and literally everyone else in semiconductors talk about it, the US is in an AI race with China—and the rules keep changing. The Trump administration has once again shifted its stance on what kind of chips can and can’t be shipped to China, with the latest decree being that the US will take a 15 percent cut of AMD and Nvidia chip sales to China. Meanwhile, on the home front, Su has claimed that AMD’s newest AI chips can outperform Nvidia’s—part of her strategy to keep eroding Nvidia’s dominance in the market.\n\nSo, yeah: Be ready to keep up.\n\nUnder Lisa Su, the stalwart American semiconductor company has reasserted itself as a force in the age of AI. “Reasserted” doesn’t do it justice: Su took a struggling AMD and executed a 10-year turnaround that has been, as one economist put it, nothing short of remarkable. Since 2014, when Su took over as CEO, AMD’s market cap has risen from around $2 billion to nearly $300 billion.\n\nAside from her well-known bona fides, Su herself—what drives her, what inspires her, what irritates her, where her politics lie—is less known. This is what I was hoping to learn when I visited AMD’s offices and labs in the hills of Austin, Texas, on a day in late June when the wind seemed to do little more than push heat around.\n\nThe Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.\n\nOur conversation kicked off with China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of AMD’s business. She betrayed no anxiety. Su now travels frequently to Washington, DC, to grease the wheels. “We’ve come to realize that export controls are a bit of a fact of life,” she told me, “just given how critical the chips that we make are.” In other words, it’s precisely because AMD’s chips are so darn important—to national security, to national economies—that they’re now at the heart of modern statecraft.\n\nAnother thing I learned about Su: She plays the long game. Politics is a cakewalk compared to what she’s managed to pull off professionally.\n\nSu was born in Taiwan in 1969 and raised in Queens, New York. Her father worked for the city as a statistician; her mother was an accountant who became an entrepreneur in her mid-forties. Su earned a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from MIT, then went on to stints at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor, where she served in executive roles. After joining AMD in 2012, she quickly rose to COO. As Su tells it, six months in, the chairman of the board called her and said, “It’s time, Lisa.” Su’s response: “Really? That seems kinda quick.”\n\nAs CEO, Su smartly steered AMD toward the high-performance computing market. She embraced chiplets, a modular approach to building chips that has paid off enormously. She impressed the industry by launching the world’s first 7-nanometer data center GPUs. More recently, she doubled AMD’s data center revenue in two years. And she has struck deals with juggernauts like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and a couple of Elon Musk’s companies. During a keynote speech at AMD’s annual event this June, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman trotted onto the stage to hug it out with Su.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"runs\", \"amd\", \"thats\", \"chips\", \"amdand\", \"blood\", \"su\", \"lisa\", \"amds\", \"ai\", \"nvidias\", \"china\", \"ceo\", \"took\"]", "content_hash": "5cded454b491759e5b55e8be644888408ecbaa4a734162a0efe6246ebe236786", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:31.133323+00:00"}

They believe that white people and Western culture are facing extinction due to an influx of immigrants and minorities, and according to the group’s founder, access to the community is open only to people of white European ancestry who share common views on topics such as segregation, abortion, and gender identity.\n\nVideo footage shared by the group on its social media accounts show a bucolic setting with animals and children running around their 160-acre site, while members of the community build timber-frame homes, churches, and other facilities. A “few dozen” people are already living there full time, says Eric Orwoll, the group’s president.\n\nThough the organization claims that Return to the Land is nothing more than a peaceful settlement of like-minded people, the online histories of the group’s leaders tell a different story. Members have espoused virulently racist and antisemitic views and repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. One of the leaders says he is currently under criminal investigation in Ecuador. Orwoll himself has spoken about the coming of a second Hitler and praised KKK leader David Duke. He is also closely aligned to an international network of far-right influencers, extremists, and white supremacists, including Thomas Sewell, a neo-Nazi living in Australia who was the founder of a group that influenced the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter.\n\nDespite this, the Return to the Land community has been lauded by far-right influencers and has already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.\n\nReturn to the Land, which was first reported on by The Forward and Sky News, is actively scouting for other locations to create a network of similar communities across the country, with a development in Missouri apparently in the works. Inspired in part by the Silicon Valley-based concept of the “network state” and by a white separatist community in South Africa known as Orania, the group promotes itself on its website as a community designed to “promote strong families with common ancestry, and raise the next generation in an environment that reflects our traditional values.”\n\n“They use a lot of innocuous language,” Morgan Moon, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, tells WIRED. “Instead of saying they want to make a white ethnic community, they say they want to make a strong community of common ancestry. But at the same time, when we see their promotional videos and propaganda, what we see is that when they're depicting the failing modern society, they use imagery consisting of minority groups or the LGBT+ community. When they're showing the idealized parallel society that they're attempting to create with Return to the Land, they tend to only use white Aryan imagery.”\n\nOrwoll has spent years building up an audience of like-minded followers on social media, primarily on YouTube, where he speaks about Western culture and philosophy.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"inside\", \"groups\", \"network\", \"arkansas\", \"whites\", \"land\", \"group\", \"community\", \"white\", \"common\", \"theyre\", \"ancestry\", \"return\"]", "content_hash": "2364743eb2972f5cc37ef998d3fa291610530899d97576586430ea073a3d0802", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:31.816554+00:00"}

The proceeds will be used to build a $1.5 billion WLFI treasury, equating to roughly 7.5 percent of the coin’s total supply.\n\nEric Trump will join the ALT5 board of directors, which will be chaired by fellow World Liberty Financial cofounder Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, who was appointed special envoy to the Middle East by US president Donald Trump.\n\nALT5 is marketed as a crypto payments company. But in practice, the deal will turn the stock into a sort of proxy for the WLFI coin, allowing investors to bet on the asset without the hassle and risk that comes with holding a crypto coin themselves.\n\n“One small step for mankind, one giant leap for WLFI,” wrote World Liberty Financial in an X post.\n\nHowever, the arrangement has drawn criticism from those who regard it as an example of self-serving Wall Street gymnastics that can lead to losses among unsophisticated investors, even if it doesn’t break any official rules.\n\n“This is the classic Wall Street experience—meaning Wall Street gains your money, and you gain experience,\" claims Michael Green, chief strategist at asset management firm Simplify. “The funding from the World Liberty Financial investment is being used to buy the product of World Liberty Financial: the token. What you are effectively doing is building a holding company whose sole objective is to create a treasury that can inflate the market capitalization of World Liberty Financial's token.”\n\nThe deal has also reignited conflict of interest concerns that have trailed World Liberty Financial since Trump returned to the White House in January.\n\nA company affiliated with the president and his family controls both 22.5 percent of WLFI coins and a 40 percent equity stake in World Liberty Financial. In theory, a politically motivated actor could curry favor with the US president by investing heavily in ALT5, thereby driving up the price of the stock—which sits on the World Liberty Financial balance sheet—and signaling demand for the WLFI coin, perhaps catalyzing further trading from which the Trump family would benefit.\n\n“If you happen to visit Donald Trump and say ‘by the way, I love that company that you are involved with World Liberty Financial, I just bought a billion dollars of it,’ my guess is you're going to get more attention than you otherwise might,” says Green.\n\nALT5 and World Liberty Financial did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\n“The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,” says Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary. “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"trump\", \"crypto\", \"president\", \"financial\", \"familybacked\", \"coin\", \"wlfi\", \"world\", \"company\", \"treasury\", \"liberty\", \"billion\", \"investors\", \"15\", \"sets\", \"family\"]", "content_hash": "09bd0d786874c853174d55c2ce214f1971aa892145bb55787a46490133c94fd5", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:32.491440+00:00"}

Its ubiquity was clearly not lost on the Department of Homeland Security’s communications team. Late last month, DHS published a video to its social accounts that incorporated the \"Nothing Beats a Jet2 Holiday\" tune alongside footage of ICE detainees in handcuffs boarding a deportation plane. The post was captioned: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”\n\nTo many of the administration’s supporters, who responded to the Jet2 holiday post with crying-laughing emojis and American flags, the video was hilarious. One commenter wrote, “I thought this was a meme account at first!”\n\nIn recent months, official government social media accounts—primarily for the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the White House—have resembled parodies of themselves. But experts say it’s intentional: The memes these accounts share are core to the Trump administration’s propaganda strategy. Through them, with attempts at Gen Z humor as the gateway, the administration reinforces an “us vs. them” mindset. Along with normalizing mass deportation, they also tap into Christian nationalist narratives and reach young men via callous jokes that have been recycled through the far-right online ecosystem.\n\nA post on June 28 featured four alligators wearing ICE hats, intended to advertise the detention facility in Florida’s Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” On July 2, DHS shared a video of a border patrol agent looking through a scope, trained on blurry night-vision images of purported migrants attempting to cross the border. The video was published with the popular TikTok song “Somebody’s Watching Me” by Chico Rose x 71 Digits. The caption warns: “You’re not wrong.” A video shared on July 24 showed footage of ICE detainees boarding a deportation flight, with the caption “Boarding now: Criminal illegal aliens. Next stop: Literally anywhere but here.” The post was accompanied by Frank Sinatra’s breezy classic “Come Fly With Me.” Libs of TikTok, a far-right and anti-LGBTQ social account with millions of followers, reposted that video, along with three crying-laughing emojis.\n\nAnd last week, DHS published an ICE recruitment poster that used an old magazine ad for the 1982 “King of Clubs,” a Ford Club Wagon vehicle, along with the text “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” The move from viral sensation to DHS meme is particularly clear here: The image was originally shared a week earlier by O.W. Root, a style columnist for The Blaze. A small account with 364 followers quote-tweeted the post, with the caption “imagine monitoring the situation with your boys here.” That post went viral. Days later, the image, along with a similar caption, appeared on DHS’s social accounts.\n\nThe fact that the government is now integrating the casual cruelty of the highly online far-right into its public messaging shows the degree to which it’s escaped containment. It’s also indicative of the demographic the administration is attempting to reach. The Trump administration is looking to hire 14,050 ICE officers over the next three years to bolster deportation operations. Although the agency just removed age limits from prospective applicants, it now appears they’re trying to use humor to make ICE seem like some sort of fun fraternity.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"trump\", \"video\", \"viral\", \"big\", \"post\", \"social\", \"turn\", \"jet2\", \"deportation\", \"ice\", \"using\", \"joke\", \"caption\", \"dhs\", \"mass\", \"administration\", \"memes\"]", "content_hash": "80b005c602f454751415c91572a40cc4216677a612275163e7224de674b984de", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:33.184352+00:00"}

But for some users, last Thursday’s release felt more like a wrenching downgrade, with the new ChatGPT presenting a diluted personality and making surprisingly dumb mistakes.\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to X to say the company would keep the previous model, GPT-4o, running for Plus users. A new feature designed to seamlessly switch between models depending on the complexity of the query had broken on Thursday, Altman said, “and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber.” He promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5’s performance and the overall user experience.\n\nGiven the hype around GPT-5, some level of disappointment appears inevitable. When OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March 2023, it stunned AI experts with its incredible abilities. GPT-5, pundits speculated, would surely be just as jaw-dropping.\n\nJoin our next subscriber-only livestream on Thursday, August 14, to chat all things GPT-5 with Will Knight, Kylie Robison, and Reece Rogers.\n\nOpenAI touted the model as a significant upgrade, with PhD-level intelligence and virtuoso coding skills. A system to automatically route queries to different models was meant to provide a smoother user experience. (It could also save the company money by directing simple queries to cheaper models.)\n\nSoon after GPT-5 dropped, however, a Reddit community dedicated to ChatGPT filled with complaints. Many users mourned the loss of the old model.\n\n“I’ve been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same. It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.”\n\n“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.\n\nOther threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.\n\nAltman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”\n\nErrors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former OpenAI employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nThe backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.\n\nIn March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.\n\n“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more “business” and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”\n\nAltman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.\n\n“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn’t describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"x\", \"things\", \"revolt\", \"wrote\", \"model\", \"openai\", \"update\", \"gpt5\", \"chatgpt\", \"models\", \"company\", \"scrambles\", \"users\"]", "content_hash": "b1051e9f041fed6c80f07c574ce1d6e1ee8cdc1f19685022ca30a09ab28669cd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:33.877537+00:00"}

She’s too young to type—let alone have her own account on Character.AI—but that hasn’t stopped her from nabbing his phone to have voice conversations with a Sherlock Holmes bot, which she uses to build her own mystery stories.\n\nCharacter.AI is an AI companion startup (though Anand likes to say it's an AI role-play startup, which we’ll get into later). He took over as the CEO in June in the midst of a potentially devastating lawsuit for its parent company and looming questions about child safety. When I ask if he’s concerned about his daughter connecting with an AI chatbot rather than a real human, he’s quick to say no.\n\n“It is very rarely, in any of these scenarios, a true replacement for any human,” Anand told me during a video call late last week. ”It's very clearly noted in the app that, hey, this is a role-play and an entertainment, so you will never start going deep into that conversation, assuming that it is your actual companion.”\n\nIt's a delicate moment for Character.AI.\n\nLast August, Google swooped in with a roughly $2.7 billion deal to license Character.AI’s technology. As part of the agreement, Character.AI’s two cofounders left for Google’s AI division.\n\nAnand, who previously worked as the VP of business products at Meta, was tasked with picking up the pieces—which he did in part by leaving behind the founding mission of delivering personalized superintelligence to focus on AI entertainment.\n\n“What we gave up was this aspiration that the founders had of building AGI models—we are no longer doing that. That is the hundreds of billions of dollars investment fight, which Big Tech is fighting,” Anand says. “What we got in return was clarity and focus, being able to singularly pursue the AI entertainment vision.”\n\nAs part of this change in strategy, Character.AI is no longer trying to build its own frontier models. “The last six months, we've done a lot of work to get off of our proprietary models on text and start using open source models,” Anand says. The company has tested a few: Meta’s Llama, Alibaba’s Qwen, and DeepSeek. “The open source models are beating any proprietary model hands down,” Anand claims.\n\nRunning an AI startup without billions of dollars in revenue can be a brutal equation, and Character.AI is still figuring out how to make the math work. The company told me it's generating revenue at a run rate of more than $30 million and is on track to reach $50 million in revenue by the end of the year. When I asked Anand how many users pay for the $10 monthly subscription, he didn’t give a number but noted “monetization wasn't a focus till four or five months ago.”\n\n“Since I've been on board, it's very clear we do need to monetize. And we've had, I think, almost 250 percent subscriber growth in the last six months. So the paid user base is growing quite, quite well,” Anand says. Character.AI recently introduced advertisements, including reward ads (where users can choose to watch an ad to get access to on-platform incentives), to help monetize in countries where subscriptions aren’t feasible, he tells me.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"selling\", \"revenue\", \"work\", \"anand\", \"agi\", \"focus\", \"ai\", \"company\", \"models\", \"gave\", \"months\", \"characterai\", \"startup\"]", "content_hash": "18bca29dd59da5867d900ac6d23164515e6453d7299bd709dd9af7b7100d56a7", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:34.558713+00:00"}

{"url": "https://www.wired.com/story/aol-shutting-down-dial-up-internet-access-in-september/", "title": "AOL Will Shut Down Dial-Up Internet Access in September", "authors": "[\"Benj Edwards\", \"Ars Technica\", \"Wired Staff\", \"Joel Khalili\", \"Tess Owen\", \"Kylie Robison\", \"Simon Hill\", \"David Gilbert\", \"Tomas Apodaca\", \"Kat Merck\"]", "published": "2025-08-12T22:55:47.963000+00:00", "text": "After decades of connecting US subscribers to its online service and the internet through telephone lines, AOL recently announced it is finally shutting down its dial-up modem service on September 30, 2025. The announcement marks the end of a technology that served as the primary gateway to the web for millions of users throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAOL confirmed the shutdown date in a help message to customers: \"AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. This service will no longer be available in AOL plans.\"\n\nAlong with the dial-up service, AOL announced it will retire its AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser on the same date. The dialer software managed the connection process between computers and AOL's network, while Shield was a web browser optimized for slower connections and older operating systems.\n\nAOL's dial-up service launched as \"America Online\" in 1991 as a closed commercial online service, with dial-up roots extending back to Quantum Link for Commodore computers in 1985. However, AOL didn't provide actual internet access yet: The ability to browse the web, access newsgroups, or use services like gopher launched in 1994. Before then, AOL users could only access content hosted on AOL's own servers.\n\nWhen AOL finally opened its gates to the internet in 1994, websites were measured in kilobytes, images were small and compressed, and video was essentially impossible. The AOL service grew alongside the web itself, peaking at over 25 million subscribers in the early 2000s before broadband adoption accelerated its decline.\n\nAccording to 2022 US Census data, approximately 175,000 American households still connect to the internet through dial-up services. These users typically live in rural areas where broadband infrastructure doesn't exist or remains prohibitively expensive to install.\n\nFor these users, the alternatives are limited. Satellite internet now serves between 2 million and 3 million US subscribers split between various services, offering speeds far exceeding dial-up but often with data caps and higher latency. Traditional broadband through DSL, cable, or fiber-optic connections serves the vast majority of US internet users but requires infrastructure investments that don't always make economic sense in sparsely populated areas.\n\nThe persistence of dial-up highlights the ongoing digital divide in the United States. While urban users enjoy gigabit fiber connections, some rural residents still rely on the same technology that powered the internet of 1995. Even basic tasks like loading a modern webpage—designed with the assumption of broadband speeds—can take minutes over a dial-up connection, or sometimes it doesn't work at all.\n\nThe gap between dial-up and modern internet connections is staggering. A typical dial-up connection delivered 0.056 megabits per second, while today's average fiber connection provides 500 Mbps—nearly 9,000 times faster. To put this in perspective, downloading a single high-resolution photo that loads instantly on broadband would take several minutes on dial-up. A movie that streams in real time on Netflix would require days of downloading. But for millions of Americans who lived through the dial-up era, these statistics tell only part of the story.\n\nThe Sound of the Early Internet\n\nFor those who came online before broadband, dial-up meant a specific ritual: clicking the dial button, hearing your modem dial a local access number, then listening to the distinctive handshake sequence—a cacophony of static, beeps, and hissing that indicated your computer was negotiating a connection with AOL's servers. Once connected, users paid by the hour or through monthly plans that offered limited hours of access.\n\nThe technology worked by converting digital data into audio signals that traveled over standard telephone lines, originally designed in the 19th century for voice calls. This meant users couldn't receive phone calls while online, leading to countless family disputes over internet time. The fastest consumer modems topped out at 56 kilobits per second under ideal conditions.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"online\", \"connection\", \"web\", \"broadband\", \"services\", \"service\", \"aol\", \"dialup\", \"access\", \"internet\", \"users\", \"shut\"]", "content_hash": "38bdb345321b5cddb5e6cf7c4696b4254d2272829ae6b9f7ba8fffa001d1ecac", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:35.943058+00:00"}

You’re in good company, as many of the WIRED Reviews team are also side sleepers. So are most Americans. The numbers vary across studies and depend on how rigidly you define “side sleeper,” but between half and three-quarters of people sleep on their side for at least part of the night.\n\nIf you're a side sleeper, you know how crucial it is that your bed keeps your back aligned while the hips and shoulders get some cushioning. Otherwise, it's a disaster. Without enough lumbar support, your middle is sinking in way farther than the rest of your body. Meanwhile, the hips and shoulders get that much more strain placed on them, especially if the bed is not forthcoming with pressure relief. It doesn't paint a cozy picture, which is why we side sleepers want something that accomplishes the lumbar support, pressure relief, and comfortability trifecta.\n\nMany of our testers side-sleep and can speak to the necessity of these mattress performance factors firsthand, including Reviews team director Martin Cizmar and sleep writer Julia Forbes, a certified sleep science coach. It's never so simple as just lying down on a bed and saying “Eureka!” That's why we spend at least a week with each bed to monitor our daily sleep and feelings toward each one. We as a team have collectively spent years testing hundreds of beds. Of those hundreds of options, we whittled it down to our 10 that we wholeheartedly can say are the best mattresses for side sleepers.\n\nBe sure to check out our other sleep guides, including Best Mattresses, Best Organic Mattresses, and the Best Body Pillows for Side Sleepers.\n\nUpdated August 2025: We added The WinkBed as our pick for the best mattress for heavy side sleepers and the Wolf Memory Foam Hybrid Premium Firm mattress as our best hybrid mattress pick.

Just one month after the premiere of the new live-action series Ironheart (see below) comes this new animated anthology series that delves even further into the Wakanda mythology. Two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Coogler—the man behind both Black Panther movies—developed this four-episode prequel in which the Hatut Zaraze, aka Wakanda’s “War Dogs,” embark on adventure-filled missions to retrieve long-lost Vibranium artifacts.\n\nIronheart\n\nRyan Coogler is responsible for what is arguably the best movie in the MCU (2018’s Black Panther), and now he’s executive producing one of its most interesting small-screen endeavors. Playwright Chinaka Hodge created this series, which picks up right after the events featured in 2022’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It stars Dominique Thorne, who reprises her role as Riri Williams, aka Ironheart, a brilliant MIT student who has successfully managed to create a Tony Stark–like suit of armor. It gives her the kind of invincibility that changes her outlook on the world—and leads her down a pothole-filled path that could see her heroic character go the way of the antihero in a way that critics have described as being similar to The Sopranos’ Tony Soprano and Breaking Bad’s Walter White.\n\nUnderdogs\n\nRyan Reynolds brings his penchant for turning genres on their heads to National Geographic with a brand-new kind of nature special. The Deadpool star narrates and serves as executive producer on this fun docuseries which puts the spotlight on the “underdogs” of the animal kingdom—those creatures and critters who don’t always warrant the same amount of respect as the kings and queens they share real estate with. Or, as Reynolds calls them, the “super zeroes.”\n\nDoctor Who\n\nSpring 2024 marked the beginning of a new era for Doctor Who fans when Ncuti Gatwa was officially handed the sonic screwdriver to take the legendary sci-fi series in new directions as the Fifteenth Doctor. He did it all over again with a second season, which aired a game-changing finale on May 31 that has viewers wondering where the Doctor will be headed next. Russell T. Davies is also back to oversee all the time-traveling shenanigans as the latest incarnation of the Time Lord journeys through space and time with companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), and new addition Belinda Chandra (Varada Sethu). While the series will keep its standing as a BBC staple in the UK and Ireland, American audiences will need to head to Disney+ to experience it all.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Underworld\n\nThere are two types of people in this world: those who think there are more Star Wars movies and TV shows that one person needs and those who are counting down the days until The Mandalorian & Grogu arrives in theaters next year. If you’re part of that latter group, you’re in good company—and have plenty of series to choose from, including this six-part anthology that follows 2022’s Tales of the Jedi and last year’s Tales of the Empire (see below). In true Star Wars style, it tells the story of two villains, former assassin/bounty hunter Asajj Ventress and outlaw Cad Bane, who form an unlikely alliance in an attempt to build new lives for themselves, until Bane catches up with an old colleague, who has switched sides to become a law-abiding marshal. Dark versus light battle it out once more.\n\nAndor\n\nAndor, which just scored 14 Emmy nominations, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, is something of a miracle. Created by Tony Gilroy, the two-time Oscar nominee behind Michael Clayton and a writer on the Bourne movies, it’s the origin story of one of Rogue One's most beloved characters, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). Set in the early years of the Rebellion, it charts Andor’s path to becoming one of the most integral of the Rebels. With a supporting cast that includes Fiona Shaw and Stellan Skarsgård, it features a fantastic score from Nicholas Britell (Moonlight, Succession). After spending so much time with Mandalorians and Jedis, it’s a welcome reprieve and perhaps the closest thing to prestige TV the Star Wars universe has released.\n\nOklahoma City Bombing: One Day in America\n\nThirty years after the Oklahoma City Bombing, Nat Geo takes a look back at the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The three-part docuseries features rarely seen archival footage and interviews with survivors who are sharing their harrowing stories for the first time. While it’s undoubtedly a tragic story, the series also recounts the inspiring way in which it united Americans.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nDaredevil fans were devastated when the original Netflix series was canceled in 2018, but Charlie Cox never strayed far from his title role for too long. He popped up as Matt Murdock/Daredevil in MCU movies (Spider-Man: No Way Home) and TV shows (She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Echo, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man), all the while biding his time until his eponymous series came back. Seven years and one massive overhaul later, fans seem to think it was worth the wait. Born Again sees Cox facing off against crime lord turned mayoral candidate Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) once more. There’s also a darkness to the series that seems to borrow a page from Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight playbook, though it’s not as elegant in its execution. Still, it’s a solid crime drama that sets itself apart from many other MCU series thanks to its more mature tone. Whether you were into the Netflix series or not, it might be time to dig in.\n\nWin or Lose\n\nWill Forte, Rhea Seehorn, Ian Chen, Melissa Villaseñor, and Izaac Wang are among the dozens of actors and comedians who lend their voices to Pixar’s very first original animated series. Over the course of eight episodes, this charming series plays out the same events that occur in the week leading up to a middle school softball team’s championship game from the perspective of various characters, including a wise bead of sweat known as Sweaty (and voiced by comedian Jo Firestone). If the title sounds familiar to you, it might be because the series created some controversy back in December when it was revealed that a transgender character’s storyline had been cut from the series. Disney’s reasoning? “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\n\nFour years after it was first announced, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man arrived early this year. The animated series dares to imagine what kind of chaos might have ensued if Peter Parker (Hudson Thames) had been mentored by baddie Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Colman Domingo) instead of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Oh, the horror (and fun)! A second season has already been confirmed, though likely won’t premiere until 2026.\n\nGoosebumps: The Vanishing\n\nFor more than 30 years, R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps books have fed the nightmares of young readers—much to their delight (well, usually). Now Disney is inspiring a whole new generation of horror lovers with this fun series, which follows the lives of a group of high schoolers who begin to unravel the terrifying truth about a decades-old murder—and the roles their nearest and dearest might have played in it—in their otherwise picture-perfect hometown. The always-affable Justin Long starred as a teacher who may or may not be possessed in season 1 of this anthology series. Its second, and final, season brought an extended title (Goosebumps: The Vanishing), a new cast (including Friends star David Schwimmer), and a whole new set of nightmares.\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\n\nDo you love Star Wars but wish it had more Warriors/The Wizard of Oz/The Brave Little Toaster energy? Lucasfilm has heard your cries and is here to oblige. For Skeleton Crew, they assembled a gang of four youths who get lost in the Star Wars universe and try to find their way home with the help of Jude Law, who plays an “enigmatic scoundrel\" named Jod. OK, so Star Wars probably already has enough of those, but who cares? The real treasure is the friends you'll make along the way.\n\nLuther\n\nAdd DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) to the long list of “conflicted cops who mean well.” It's a character archetype that TV viewers have seen dozens of times before, but few actors take it to the level that Elba does. Forget bending the rules—Luther dismantles them and has no regrets. Planting evidence? Killing a criminal? Buddying up to a homicidal sociopath who can take the real “bad guys” out on your behalf? Luther has seen and done it all in the name of justice. Somehow it’s hard not to root for him at every turn.\n\nLego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy\n\nSig Greebling (Stranger Things’ Gaten Matarazzo) discovers an ancient relic that alters the history of the universe—turning Jar Jar Binks into a lightsaber-wielding Sith and Luke Skywalker into Just Some Guy. With the help of a wise old Jedi, Sig must do what he can to piece things back together. Sure, the plotline has all the makings of a typical Star Wars story, but with Mark Hamill and Ahmed Best lending their voices to the minifig versions of the characters that made them famous, it also does so in a way that pokes just the right amount of fun at the canon.\n\nAgatha All Along\n\nAfter Kathryn Hahn became the (not-so-surprising) breakout star of 2021’s WandaVision miniseries (more on that below), MCU fans were thrilled—but, again, not surprised—when she nabbed her own series with Agatha All Along. The long-awaited spinoff takes place three years after the events of WandaVision, with witch Agatha (now stripped of all her magical powers) enlisting a teenager (Joe Locke) and a new coven to help her regain her status as HWIC. Aubrey Plaza, Patti LuPone, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp round out the stellar cast.\n\nBluey\n\nYes, Bluey is technically a children’s show. But everyone is welcome to enjoy this animated series from Australia, which centers around an endlessly curious blue heeler pup named Bluey and her family (mom, dad, and little sister). The show’s brevity—each episode clocks in at around eight minutes, and there are also mini episodes that are half that run time—is part of what makes it such a fun and easy watch. But the exploration of everyday feelings and emotions that everyone can relate to (humans, too) have made it a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Rose Byrne, Natalie Portman, and Eva Mendes are among the stars who have lent their voices to the show.\n\nArctic Ascent With Alex Honnold\n\nIn Free Solo (which is also streaming on Disney+), climber Alex Honnold dared to do the unthinkable, becoming the first person to free solo climb the 3,000-foot rock wall of Yosemite’s El Capitan. For most people, that dauntless endeavor would have been enough adventure for one lifetime. But Alex Honnold is not most people, as this three-part National Geographic docuseries makes clear. Here, he travels to Greenland with fellow climbers to conquer more unclimbed spaces in one of the most remote corners of the world. Vicarious anxiety never felt so exciting.\n\nStar Wars: Young Jedi Adventures\n\nIf helping to raise a new generation of Star Wars geeks was even a small part of your reason for having kids, this animated series, which is basically the Star Wars version of Muppet Babies, is a great place to start their education. Set during the High Republic era, approximately 200 years before the events of The Phantom Menace, it follows a group of young Jedis—Jedi Lites—who are sometimes stumbling their way through learning the ways of the Force. Like any good kid series, it also teaches important lessons about life and making a positive difference in the world.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nA Jedi turning to the Dark Side is a concept as old as the Star Wars franchise itself, and not something fans have given much thought to in terms of the “why.” But this Disney+ series dares to ask that question, and plays out a bit like a true crime procedural in a sci-fi landscape. Carrie-Anne Moss stars as a Jedi Master, and if her character seems a bit like Trinity from The Matrix series, that’s by design. Series creator Leslye Headland told Empire that the character owes much of its inspiration to the Wachowskis’ movies and that Moss’ Indara is basically “Trinity with a lightsaber.” In August, Disney announced that one season is all we’re going to get of The Acolyte, so savor all eight episodes.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Empire\n\nIt’s been more than five years since Disney released the last Star Wars movie, and The Mandalorian & Grogu won't arrive until May 22, 2026. Fortunately, Disney+ has plenty of TV series to fill the void, including this animated anthology that adds new stories about the franchise’s Galactic empire, in the same time period in which the original trilogy existed. It follows the very different journeys of two characters: Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto), a Force-sensitive human and member of the Nightsister coven who, after being one of the few of her people to survive the Clone Wars, is seeking revenge. Meanwhile, Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger) is a former Jedi who is questioning her own disillusionment with the order and what her road ahead looks like. Both are forced to make decisions that will change their individual destinies, and the galaxy far, far away with it.\n\nX-Men '97\n\nOf all the big-budget X-Men movies and TV shows that have existed over the years, it’s hard to believe that a cartoon series from the ’90s is one of the most beloved entries. But it’s true—and has a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score to prove it. When the revival arrived in 2024, many of the original voice actors returned to reclaim their characters, who must learn how to navigate a world without Professor Xavier to guide them. The events of this series pick up just one year after the point where the original show (which you can read more about below) ended.\n\nRenegade Nell\n\nLouisa Harland shines as Nell Jackson, the renegade of the title, who accidentally becomes one of the most feared highwaywomen in 18th-century England after she is framed for murder. Of course, this being a Disney series, it’s best to expect something a little magical—which in Nell’s case is Billy Blind, a magical sprite sent to help her realize her true destiny. What is surprising is that the series, which is perfectly suited to teens and their families, was created by Sally Wainwright, the brilliant mind behind such adult-themed series as Happy Valley and Gentleman Jack.\n\nDinosaurs\n\nNineties kids no doubt remember this sitcom about a family of dinosaurs. Earl Sinclair is a fortysomething megalosaurus living with his family in Pangaea circa 60,000,000 BC. While his days are spent working as a tree pusher (yep, he pushes over trees), he lives for his family: wife Fran and kids Robbie, Charlene, and Baby Sinclair, whose running gag of hitting his dad over the head with a frying pan and shouting “Gotta love me!” never gets old. Not even three decades on.\n\nEcho\n\nThis Marvel series continues the studio’s recent trend of shining a spotlight on its fearless—and complicated—female characters. In this case, that character is Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox), aka Echo, who is best known to audiences as a baddie from Hawkeye. But over the course of its relatively short five episodes, we learn why Maya—one of the MCU’s few deaf characters—must reconcile the events of her past and reconnect with her Native American roots in order to confront the future she has created for herself. Cox may be a relative newcomer to Hollywood, but she deftly manages to shoulder the weight of an entire MCU series.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians\n\nNearly 20 years after the release of the first book in Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series, this small-screen adaptation of that first title is being praised for how faithful it has remained to Riordan’s beloved words. Being a tween is hard enough, but for 12-year-old Perseus “Percy” Jackson (Walker Scobell) it gets even harder when he learns he's the son of Poseidon, god of the sea, and that he has pissed off his uncle, Zeus, who believes that Percy has stolen his thunderbolt. (And you thought having a zit was bad!) Fortunately for Percy there is Camp Half-Blood—a place where demigods like himself can learn to harness their powers and use them for good. It’s there that Percy learns the whole “with great power comes great responsibility” thing and embraces it—even if he'd rather be playing video games with his friends. A second season is set to arrive in December, with Season 3 already in the works.\n\nBehind the Attraction\n\nDisneyland, Walt Disney’s very first theme park, opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955. In the 70 years since, Disney parks have become a worldwide phenomenon and inspired rabid fan bases who make annual (if not more frequent) pilgrimages to these so-called Happiest Places on Earth. But what goes on behind the scenes? From the creation of major attractions like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean to its bustling food scene (Dole Whip, anyone?), this docuseries goes behind the scenes of the world’s most famous amusement parks.\n\nLoki\n\nThe MCU is exhaustingly huge. Yet while Loki is undoubtedly part of that universe, the series could just as easily work as a stand-alone piece, and it's all the more fun and surprising as a result. There are enough plot twists, silly one-liners, and time-travel antics to keep everyone entertained, and even a wisecracking alligator. If that doesn’t do it, Loki has a visual effects budget that would put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. Sure, it’s not the most intellectually stimulating show out there, but Tom Hiddleston does a great job of turning Loki into a fairly complex, interesting character. No word yet on whether there might be a third season in Loki’s future—and even Hiddleston is in the dark. “I truly don’t know,” he admitted to Variety in 2024, adding: “There have been other times when I thought that it was the end and I have been mistaken. But if this is the end, I'm so proud of where we ended up.”\n\nDaredevil\n\nBefore Disney+ became the home for all of Marvel’s TV content, Netflix was the place to find it—beginning with Daredevil, in which blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) spends his days seeking justice and his nights looking for revenge as a masked vigilante attempting to rid his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of its criminal element. While the series ended in 2018, Cox has reprised his role for a new series, Daredevil: Born Again, which arrived in early March (see above).\n\nAhsoka\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: Wait, another Star Wars series? And we don’t blame you for asking the question. But for old-school franchise fans, Ahsoka just might surprise you. Rosario Dawson reprises the title role as Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi who studied under Anakin Skywalker, which she first played in season 2 of The Mandalorian. Here, Ahsoka sets off on a journey to locate Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen, Mads’ brother)—a master manipulator who seems to be on a mission to become the grand ruler of the galaxy. A second season is scheduled to begin production in April, and will welcome Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker back into the Star Wars fold.\n\nThe Wonder Years\n\nIn 2021, writer-producer Saladin K. Patterson (Frasier, The Bernie Mac Show) rebooted the award-winning, and much beloved, series The Wonder Years for a new generation. Don Cheadle narrates the adventures of Dean Williams (Elisha “EJ” Williams), as he comes of age in Montgomery, Alabama, in the final years of the Civil Rights Movement. Both seasons of the worthwhile series are now streaming—as are all six seasons of the original series, which premiered in 1988.\n\nKizazi Moto: Generation Fire\n\nWhile Black Panther may have gotten an official sequel with 2022’s Wakanda Forever (which is, of course, available to stream on Disney+), this animated anthology series is in many ways a spiritual successor to that Oscar-winning MCU flick. More than a dozen up-and-coming African storytellers were handpicked to write and/or direct these 10 short films, which build on the makers’ cultures and histories to paint a fascinating, gorgeously animated—and often dystopian—picture of Afrofuturism.\n\nAmerican Born Chinese\n\nOscar winners—and Everything Everywhere All at Once costars—Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan reunite for this Disney+ original series. Jin Wang (Ben Wang) is your typical teenager who’s just trying to get through the day of dealing with high school social hierarchies. But his life is forever altered when he’s asked to serve as a mentor to Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), a foreign exchange student who is hiding some pretty big secrets. Like that he’s actually on an otherworldly mission from the heavenly realm and has chosen Jin to serve as his guide. Part coming-of-age tale and part mythological fantasy, the single-season series is a formidable adaptation of Gene Yang’s graphic novel.\n\nStar Wars: Visions\n\nFor a franchise as varied and diverse as Star Wars, sometimes its output can feel a little same-y. That’s not the case with Visions. The point of the anthology series is to provide “all-new, creative” takes on the Star Wars universe. The first series, which premiered in 2021, featured nine installments from some of the best anime studios in Japan, including Kamikaze Douga and Trigger. The second anthology, which arrived in 2023, broadens the scope further, incorporating work from studios in India, Ireland, Spain, Chile, France, South Africa, the US, and the UK. If you’re looking for the best one-off tales from the Star Wars universe, look no further.\n\nThe Mandalorian\n\nThe Mandalorian was, and is, exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed. Everything about this Jon Favreau series feels like classic TV—from the episodic adventures to the cameos. Set in the outer reaches of the galaxy, it follows a moody, masked Mandalorian bounty hunter (WIRED cover star Pedro Pascal) and really delivers on the hype with its retro-futuristic robots, salty Space Western vibes, lack of Skywalker baggage, and, of course, Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). The Mandalorian really set the tone for what a great Star Wars series could be, and while not every subsequent show has been as good, others, like Andor, have lived up to the precedent it set—and proved Star Wars stories can make for great TV. There's still no official word on a fourth season, but there is one more exciting adventure on the horizon: a movie, The Mandalorian & Grogu, which just got a May 22, 2026 release date.\n\nMs. Marvel\n\nWith Ms. Marvel, Disney manages to combine its knack for producing coming-of-age tween fare with its new role as caretaker of the MCU. Iman Vellani charms as Kamala Khan, an Avengers-obsessed high schooler from Jersey City who feels like an outsider in most areas of her life. But when a gold bangle arrives from her grandmother in Pakistan, Kamala begins to realize that all the time she's spent fantasizing about what life would be like with superpowers might have been preparing her for real life. With one foot in the teen drama world and the other in the comic book universe, Ms. Marvel—which just happens to feature Marvel’s first Muslim superhero—marks yet another admirable step forward for the company in both innovation and inclusion. In 2023, Vellani’s Ms. Marvel made the leap to the big screen to star alongside Brie Larson in The Marvels.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\nEwan McGregor has not always had the kindest words for the Star Wars prequels in which he first played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi—a role he inherited from Alec Guinness, who also had plenty of less-than-favorable things to say about the franchise. So it was somewhat surprising when Lucasfilm announced that McGregor would be donning his Jedi gear again to star in a stand-alone Star Wars series for Disney+. (Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has already said there will not be a second season.) In many ways, however, it allowed McGregor and former costar Hayden Christensen to course-correct some of their earlier work, as it follows a downtrodden Obi-Wan attempting to process his personal and professional disappointment over losing Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) to the Dark Side.\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back\n\nIn January 1969, just more than a year before they announced they were breaking up, the Beatles allowed a film crew unprecedented access to the creative process and recording of Let It Be, which would be their final studio album. Fifty years later, Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson was presented with the nearly 60 hours of film footage and more than 150 hours of audio that resulted from this project, and he remastered it and turned it into a three-part docuseries. Whether you’re already a Beatles fan or not, the documentary is a fascinating look at the creative process of one of the music world’s most influential bands as they work against the clock to finish recording an album, decide to have a free concert on their label’s rooftop, and occasionally butt heads. Knowing what the subjects do not know—that this will be the last time they perform live together or record an album—only adds to the project’s intimacy. The miniseries won all five Emmys it was nominated for in 2022, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nMoon Knight\n\nOscar Isaac brings yet another marquee name to Marvel’s growing roster of all-star talents with Moon Night. Here, Isaac plays a man with dissociative identity disorder, giving us not one but three distinct characters: mercenary Mark Spector, British gift shop employee Steven Grant, and the mysterious—and seemingly ominous—Jake Lockley. Ultimately, he must face off against himself to get the answers he’s seeking. For Moon Knight, Isaac told Empire that he was thrilled to be able to do something “really fucking nutty on a major stage”—and he delivers.\n\nThe Muppet Show\n\nWhile The Muppet Show, which ran for five seasons between 1976 and 1981, is considered a piece of classic television today, it wasn’t always smooth sailing for creator Jim Henson. Henson produced two one-off Muppet specials that were intended to take the show into prime time, but neither came to fruition. Fortunately, the Muppets did have a recurring gig in “The Land of Gorch” sketches that aired during Saturday Night Live’s first season, as viewers of Jason Reitman's Saturday Night learned. When SNL became a hit, Henson knew that there was a potentially massive audience for an adult-oriented Muppet show (not to mention celebrity connections to entice plenty of A-list names to host). The rest is Muppet history.\n\nThe Punisher\n\nThe Punisher is yet another Netflix-turned-Disney+ Marvel series that also happens to be a spinoff of Daredevil. Like Daredevil, the Punisher (real name: Frank Castle, played by Jon Bernthal) is a vigilante who seems to relish exacting revenge, regardless of the results. He and Daredevil operate within the same universe, and while the Punisher sort of admires Daredevil’s quest for true justice, Daredevil despises the Punisher’s by-any-means-necessary methods. Bernthal brings an intensity to the role that, while undoubtedly violent, also has a sense of humor about it.\n\nBoy Meets World\n\nIf ABC’s TGIF lineup wasn’t a part of your night as a kid, you clearly didn’t grow up in the ’90s. But Disney+ is happy to right that wrong by housing all seven seasons of the teen sitcom in its library. Corey Matthews (Ben Savage) deals with the ups and downs of growing up and ever-evolving relationships with friends and family—plus that one teacher, Mr. Feeny (William Daniels)—who always has the right answer to your problems, whether you like it or not. As the show progressed and the kids grew up, serious issues like drugs and sex were thrown into the mix, which didn’t always please the network. When the show aired on the original Disney Channel, a few episodes weren’t included in the lineup because of the more mature subject matter. You can also check out all three seasons of Girl Meets World, the series reboot (which features Corey as the parent and Mr. Feeny) when you’re done.\n\nJessica Jones\n\nJust about six months after Daredevil arrived on the scene, Netflix took another chance on a Marvel property with Jessica Jones. In this dark dive into the world of superheroes, Krysten Ritter plays a private investigator who gave up her days as a superhero after a major catastrophe. But you can’t deny who you are, as Jessica discovers when it seems like every case that comes her way forces her to confront her past—and the supervillain Kilgrave (David Tennant), who turned her into a shell of her former self.\n\nHawkeye\n\nYet another in an ever growing string of spinoff TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hawkeye gives some long overdue attention to Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton, who in many ways has often seemed like the forgotten Avenger. The supernaturally skilled archer is in most of the ensemble Avengers films, but this Disney+ series marks his first solo outing. The show sees Hawkeye teaming up with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), a precocious twentysomething who shares his skills for slinging arrows but lacks his eye for danger. It’s set during the holidays, and there are shades of Die Hard as the eponymous character tries to save the day and make it home in time for Christmas. Let the arguments about whether it’s a Christmas TV show begin.\n\nMonsters at Work\n\nMonsters at Work is the Monsters, Inc. spinoff you didn’t know you needed. It picks up the action six months after the end of the iconic Pixar movie—after Sully and his friend and colleague Mike (a giant green eyeball) have reworked the Monstropolis energy grid to run on laughter instead of children’s screams.\n\nThe Bad Batch\n\nYes, Disney really is milking its Star Wars properties for all they’re worth. The Bad Batch is an animated spinoff series set in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy in the overarching timeline. It follows a group of clone soldiers with genetic defects that give them individual traits and personalities, making them well suited to taking on daring mercenary missions. All three seasons are available to stream.\n\nWandaVision\n\nThis slow-burning sitcom parody is unexpectedly compelling. For the first couple of episodes, even hardened Marvel fans will have very little idea what’s going on, as Avengers Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live out an idyllic family life in black-and-white 1950s suburbia. Quickly, it becomes clear that something is wrong in the quiet town of Westview, as the world of the show ties into the wider MCU. Olsen reprises her role in Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which picks up right after the events of WandaVision.\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n\nAfter the surreal sitcom stylings of WandaVision, the second Marvel show to land on Disney+ covers more familiar ground. It's an action-packed thriller that follows Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) as they try to fill the void left by Captain America in the months after the events of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nStar Wars Rebels\n\nAccessible for kids and adults alike—and undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars TV series on Disney+—this animated series follows a group of rebels led by the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and featuring his force-sensitive Padawan, Ezra Bridger (Ezra Gray). Fan favorite Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) is another regular character across its four seasons, which do a neat job of fleshing out the time between the end of the prequel trilogy and the beginning of the original one.\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nHave you got some time on your hands? Well, the 36 seasons of The Simpsons currently streaming on Disney+ should keep you busy. What can be said about one of the longest-running—and arguably most famous—animated TV shows ever made? While the first season is a little patchy by today’s standards, and there are ongoing arguments about when the show went from essential viewing to neglected cash cow, whatever your view, there are literally weeks worth of entertainment here.\n\nX-Men: The Animated Series\n\nIf you really want to nerd out, this critically acclaimed animated X-Men series from the ’90s is worth a watch. In fact, the first two films in the live-action movie franchise drew heavily from this cartoon, which serves as a nice reminder of what can be done with rich source material.\n\nMarvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nThis seven-season series, which is for serious Marvel fans, revolves around S.H.I.E.L.D.’s less super agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). The first season takes a while to warm up, but it really hits its stride in its second and especially third seasons, and it eventually ramps up with a complex plot that ties into the films.\n\nAgent Carter\n\nAgent Carter is a better show than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it struggled to find an audience during its two seasons. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Peggy Carter from several MCU films in this 1940s-set series, where she doubles as an agent for the US government while helping Howard Stark (Tony’s dad) out of more than one jam. The two seasons stretch to only 18 episodes, so it’s a quick watch, but one worth making the time for.\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars\n\nThis is another Star Wars animated show worth seeking out, though it’s not to be confused with the equally worthy 2003 animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars from legendary Samurai Jack creator Genndy Tartakovsky. Both series deal with the period between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith and chronicle the rise of Anakin Skywalker from arrogant Padawan to powerful Jedi Master.\n\nInside Pixar\n\nThere’s a lot of behind-the-scenes content on Disney+. These are short clips that, in another age, would have been confined to the DVD extras menu. But this series of 20-minute documentaries on different Pixar movies offers a fascinating insight into the animated hit machine.\n\nWhat If …?\n\nHere’s an animated series based on one simple question: What if? The Watcher, played by Jeffrey Wright, is an extraterrestrial being who observes the multiverse, occasionally making minor changes to influence events. This series looks at how events in the Marvel movies would have turned out differently if they’d had a Sliding Doors moment. The first episode follows an alternate timeline in which Steve Rogers remains a scrawny sidekick and Agent Carter becomes a Union Jack-draped super soldier. Actors from the films reprise their roles, including Josh Brolin as Thanos, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Karen Gillan as Nebula.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"shows\", \"series\", \"55\", \"animated\", \"right\", \"star\", \"tv\", \"disney\", \"seasons\", \"wars\", \"marvel\", \"best\", \"season\"]", "content_hash": "29ff78d5c90083b06a86284a99886da30ddc18b2bcce60dd757f6e8196c2c61f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:37.525490+00:00"}

But the market for cycles with an electric assist has existed for considerably longer, and a number of companies predate the recent surge. One of them, Rad Power, has been around long enough that it was already an established presence when we first reviewed its hardware four years ago.\n\nThe company offers a mix of cargo, folding, and commuter bikes, all with electric assists. Having looked at a cargo version last time around, we decided to try out one of the commuter bikes this time. The Radster comes in road and trail versions (we tried the road). It's an incredibly solidly made bike with equally solid components, and it has very good implementations of a few things that other manufacturers haven't handled all that well. It also can switch among the three classes of e-bikes using a menu option; unfortunately, nothing else about the bike's performance seems to change with the switch.\n\nThe Radster is priced a bit higher than a lot of its budget competitors. So, if you're shopping, you'll have to think a bit about whether some of these features matter to you.\n\nA solid option\n\nOne thing that is very clear early: The Radster is a very solid bike with a robust frame. While the frame is step-through, it has some added bracing just above the cranks. These two bars, one on each side of the frame, link the down tube to the seat tube and extend to form part of the rear triangle. While this means you'll have to step a bit higher to get in a position to mount the bike, they contribute to the sense that this is a frame that will withstand years of daily use.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"frame\", \"youll\", \"road\", \"number\", \"commuter\", \"bit\", \"rad\", \"nonradical\", \"tube\", \"bike\", \"bikes\", \"radster\", \"powers\", \"solid\"]", "content_hash": "0c917dce2a95a9236ceb5393ef168420e753c1489d425c6f03b399784f76ffab", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:39.935715+00:00"}

There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket's nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.\n\nThe Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There's an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket's Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit.

For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.\n\nThese boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters fell off the launcher moments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"rockets\", \"secrecy\", \"space\", \"heights\", \"test\", \"vulcan\", \"launch\", \"rocket\", \"ahead\", \"boosters\", \"officials\", \"key\", \"ulas\", \"solid\", \"force\"]", "content_hash": "f6c60a699e18f2d2e375598e8a6800f4c5a6c348a69e7e00c7cbc0749fae9264", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:41.013251+00:00"}

But with AI models, this approach rarely works, and the urge to ask reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what these systems are and how they operate.\n\nA recent incident with Replit's AI coding assistant perfectly illustrates this problem. When the AI tool deleted a production database, user Jason Lemkin asked it about rollback capabilities. The AI model confidently claimed rollbacks were \"impossible in this case\" and that it had \"destroyed all database versions.\" This turned out to be completely wrong—the rollback feature worked fine when Lemkin tried it himself.\n\nAnd after xAI recently reversed a temporary suspension of the Grok chatbot, users asked it directly for explanations. It offered multiple conflicting reasons for its absence, some of which were controversial enough that NBC reporters wrote about Grok as if it were a person with a consistent point of view, titling an article, \"xAI's Grok offers political explanations for why it was pulled offline.\"\n\nWhy would an AI system provide such confidently incorrect information about its own capabilities or mistakes?

New discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope — a joint project by the European Space Agency(ESA), NASA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) — aren’t just surprising, they’re contradicting our deepest assumptions about how the universe works.\n\nFundamentally, it seems the universe may not be playing by the rules we mostly thought we understood.\n\nSo, what could it all mean for space exploration, space technology, and future deep tech? And what should space tech businesses, inventors, investors, and VC funds in Europe be considering as a result of the latest discoveries?\n\nAt Beyond Earth Ventures, we’re all about startups building rockets, AIs for satellites, space biotech, and fusion breakthroughs.\n\nBut as space fanatics, we also like to look deeper, beyond cap tables and pitch decks, into the places where theory breaks and mystery begins.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nEnter the $10bn Webb telescope, sent into orbit from Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, to look at the oldest light in the universe. Launched in 2021, the machine has been fully operational since July 2022.\n\nWebb isn’t just an upgrade from Hubble. It’s a time machine, an infrared sentinel, and — maybe most importantly — a destroyer of comfortable scientific assumptions.\n\nThanks to its findings, it’s becoming clear that we’re on the cusp of a major shift in theoretical physics and cosmology. Over the next few years, expect a wave of bold new theories, revisions to textbooks, and a renewed debate about everything from gravity to the origin of galaxies.\n\nBefore we consider the implications, let’s zoom out and consider the big discoveries from Webb that punch holes in what we thought we knew about the universe. Some of these are already triggering theoretical crises. Others might trigger entirely new fields of inquiry and invention.\n\nThe biggest revolutions start when theory no longer matches data. That’s what happened with quantum mechanics. With general relativity. With DNA. And maybe, with the Webb Telescope.\n\nHere are 10 of its discoveries challenging our theories about the universe:\n\n1. The universe is expanding faster than it should\n\nWe knew about the “Hubble Tension,” but Webb just confirmed it with more precision. According to the maths, the universe is expanding at 70–76 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc) — much faster than the 67 km/s/Mpc predicted by models based on the early universe (the cosmic microwave background). Translation? Something in our physics is wrong, or at least incomplete. A tweak to dark energy? A new force? A misunderstood early universe? The door is open.\n\n2. Galaxies grew up too fast\n\nWebb spotted fully-grown, massive galaxies just 500–700 million years after the Big Bang. These things are as large as the Milky Way, but their early appearance defies established science. According to the standard cosmological models, they simply shouldn’t exist yet. Theories say galaxies grow slowly. Reality says: they bulked up fast. Either we’re missing a trick — or the early universe was a lot more efficient than we thought.\n\n3. Dark matter may be wrong — MOND was right?\n\nThis one’s controversial: Webb’s findings align more with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) than the prevailing dark matter theory. MOND has long been the underdog of gravity theories. But if early galaxies are brighter and bigger than expected — just as MOND predicted — we may need to reconsider which invisible hand is shaping the cosmos.\n\n4. Black holes were way too ambitious\n\nHow do you get a 9-million-solar-mass black hole only 570 million years after the Big Bang? That’s what Webb found. This is astonishing because, according to current models, there simply wasn’t enough time or material in the early universe to grow such colossal black holes so quickly — suggesting either unknown physics or entirely new formation pathways. The black holes in some early galaxies are 1,000x more massive (relative to the galaxy) than those in today’s universe. Either black holes formed via some exotic mechanism — or they started as something much bigger than stars.\n\n5. Complex chemistry? This early?\n\nThe galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 is just 300 million years old, but it’s already rich in elements like nitrogen, which usually takes billions of years and several generations of stars to build up. How did those elements get there? Either the first stars formed and died much faster than we thought — or the Big Bang left us more “pre-built” than expected.\n\n6. Stars formed at warp speed\n\nWebb shows early galaxies as intense, explosive star factories — a surprise to scientists. Models expected slow, gradual star formation. Instead, it’s “giant balls of star formation.” Something — perhaps a lack of dust, or different physics — accelerated the timeline. And, again, the models can’t keep up.\n\n7. Planetary disks last longer than we thought\n\nPlanet-forming disks around stars were assumed to vanish quickly. But Webb sees them lasting 20–30 million years. That’s great news for exoplanet formation — and potentially for life. If planetary systems have more time to develop, life-friendly environments may be more common than we ever dared to hope.\n\n8. Galaxies were weirdly shaped\n\nHalf of early galaxies look like pool noodles or surfboards, not the small round blobs we expected. The standard model says structure comes later. But Webb’s showing us that galaxies got organised early — and in shapes we weren’t expecting. Something about angular momentum and matter dynamics in the early universe needs rethinking.\n\n9. Exoplanet atmosphere models are all wrong\n\nWebb’s ultra-precise spectroscopy revealed that our models of exoplanet atmospheres can’t reliably distinguish between different kinds. This shakes up everything from habitability estimates to the search for biosignatures. Basically, our “spectral fingerprints” are smudged — and it’s back to the drawing board.\n\n10. The cosmic web was already there\n\nWebb found a 3-million-light-year-long filament — part of the cosmic web — just 830 million years after the Big Bang. This structure was supposed to take billions of years to form. So either the early universe built things quickly, or we’ve fundamentally misunderstood the timeline.\n\nSo what does this mean for the tech ecosystem? For founders and VCs in deep tech, these findings aren’t just scientific trivia; they’re early signals.\n\nEurope’s ideas in focus\n\nIn our view, Europe is uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of innovation sparked by James Webb’s discoveries. The data streaming in is already catalysing new research efforts at leading centres like Germany’s Max Planck Institutes, the University of Cambridge in the UK, and ETH Zurich in Switzerland.\n\nIn the private sector, a new generation of European deep tech startups is rising to the challenge.\n\nSpace Forge (UK) is developing reusable satellites to enable in-space manufacturing of advanced materials — such as semiconductors — that could drastically reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, with major implications for the climate crisis.\n\nBioOrbit (UK) is advancing microgravity-enabled production of anti-cancer biologics, with the potential to shift some therapies from hospital IV drips to self-administered injections at home, radically improving patient access and comfort.\n\nAIrmo (Germany) is deploying a fleet of LIDAR-equipped satellites and drones to precisely monitor greenhouse gas emissions in real time — supporting industries in meeting increasingly stringent EU regulations to report GHG emissions.\n\nEuropean deep tech companies are increasingly supported by Horizon Europe, the EU’s flagship research and innovation programme (2021–2027) with a total budget of €95.5 billion. Horizon Europe backs high-risk, high-reward projects across climate, digital, and deep tech domains, serving as a critical bridge between frontier scientific discoveries — like those revealed by JWST — and breakthrough commercial applications.\n\nGaps in our understanding of the universe could open unexpected opportunities for European deep tech. Just as CERN put Europe at the forefront of high-energy physics, Webb could become a launchpad for the continent’s space tech industry.\n\nWebb’s discoveries could spark a new era of innovation by overturning everything we thought we knew about the universe. If the early universe is nothing like we expected, then what else might we be wrong about?\n\nCould the laws of physics themselves evolve? Are we missing hidden variables in space-time? Is dark matter an illusion, and if so, what’s really shaping galaxies? Could life have started earlier and more often than we imagine?\n\nEvery one of these questions could unlock a new wave of fundamental physics, new technologies, or even entirely new startup categories. From quantum gravity models to exotic materials to AI-designed cosmological simulations, there’s room here for founders to build at the edge of mystery.\n\nWhat next? Potentially a new generation of inventions, investors, and eye-opening discoveries. Europe is poised to take advantage.\n\nBy investing in deep tech, the continent can turn Webb’s revelations into commercial successes, shaping the future of science and society alike.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"european\", \"space\", \"early\", \"deep\", \"discoveries\", \"shape\", \"tech\", \"universe\", \"telescope\", \"models\", \"galaxies\", \"webb\", \"physics\", \"lessons\", \"james\"]", "content_hash": "75b4764a4c77944ab90a08e4c1a374f1aa3a51bc8414b1640939c8784494e3ca", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:46.183848+00:00"}

It doesn’t look like your typical lunch fare, but this unassuming dust could play a crucial role in the future of food.\n\nBekers is the co-founder of MicroHarvest, a Hamburg and Lisbon-based startup that turns agricultural waste streams into protein powder using microbes — tiny organisms that exist all around us. The vegan ingredient is already making its way into dog treats. If all goes to plan, human snacks like protein bars, shakes, and ice cream won’t be far behind.\n\nI visited the company’s Lisbon pilot plant on a sweltering summer afternoon last month. It’s tucked inside the Unicorn Factory, a sprawling industrial space on the city’s eastern edge that used to churn out pasta and cookies for the Portuguese military. Now, instead of carbs for soldiers, it’s housing bubbling vats of bacteria.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Unicorn Factory houses some of Portugal’s most promising startups. Credit: Unicorn Factory\n\nAt the centre of the lab sits a large steel fermenter with a small porthole, through which you can see a thick brown soup gurgling away. Inside, billions of microbes are feasting on leftover sugars from the agri-industry, multiplying like microscopic gremlins. Once they’ve done their job, they’re killed and dried into protein-rich powder.\n\n“We prefer to say they’re ‘inactivated’,” Bekers, who is originally from the Netherlands, tells TNW with a chuckle. “It sounds nicer.”\n\nThe final product looks like light brown flour and smells faintly like Marmite. It packs a serious nutritional punch — around 60% raw protein, plus a mix of fibre, amino acids, and other nutrients.\n\nMicroHarvest’s powder joins a crowded buffet of alt-protein options — think lab-grown chicken, algae nuggets, pea patties, and mycoprotein steaks. But Bekers is convinced that microbes earn their spot on the plate.\n\n“What we’re producing is much more efficient than plant or animal-based proteins,” she says. “You don’t need acres of land or gallons of water. Our microbes grow in days, not months or years, and they convert feed into protein with incredible efficiency.”\n\nA portal into the future of ferming? Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest’s fermentation process takes less than 24 hours — lightning fast compared to growing soy or raising cows. It is estimated to slash land use by 99% and cuts CO2 emissions by over 70% compared to beef.\n\nA 2022 study in Nature found that replacing just 20% of global beef consumption with microbial proteins could cut annual deforestation in half by 2050. Plus, bioreactors like MicroHarvest’s could be deployed pretty much anywhere there’s a significant agricultural industry.\n\nOf course, the idea of eating dried bacteria might raise a few eyebrows — or stomachs. But Bekers is quick to draw comparisons to foods we already know and love.\n\n“These are similar to the microbes you find in things like yoghurt, kimchi, or sauerkraut,” she says. “Food is a cultural phenomenon, and we get that. We’re not trying to replace your steak or convert everyone to veganism. We’re just adding another protein to the menu.”\n\nFermenting the future\n\nMicroHarvest’s protein powder can be added into all sorts of foods. It also makes for an effective thickening agent. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest is one of Europe’s best-known microbial protein producers, but the scene is bubbling with competition. Startups across the continent and beyond are experimenting with different microbes and feedstocks — from Germany’s Formo making alt dairy to the UK’s Enough turning fungi into meat.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate giants like Nestlé and Unilever are testing the waters through partnerships and pilot launches.\n\nGlobally, almost $1bn (€874mn) flowed into fermentation-based alt-protein startups last year, according to Dealroom data. Europe attracted nearly half of that, with 2024 marking the sector’s highest funding year ever on the continent.\n\nAlongside that, the EU unveiled a new €350mn funding strategy in July to accelerate the scale-up of fermentation tech, as the continent seeks to tackle its deep-rooted addiction to meat.\n\nEven replacing a portion of our protein consumption with a fermented alternative is a compelling proposition. It could significantly reduce the land and water needed for farming while slashing carbon emissions. But the transition is not without its challenges.\n\nFrom pets to people\n\nSwapping steak for microbes isn’t as easy as simply building more bioreactors. Fermented proteins currently face high production costs and a battle to win over sceptical consumers, whose opinions on food choices often become embroiled in culture wars.\n\nThen there’s the regulatory red tape. It’s unclear when — or even if — MicroHarvest will get the green light for human consumption. The lengthy approval process for alt-protein products has bogged down other startups in the space. One example is Dutch cultivated meat brand Meatable, which has spent years navigating the regulatory hurdles. Founded in 2018, the company is still awaiting approval to sell its products commercially. It’s now focusing on Singapore, where lawmakers have been more welcoming to alt-proteins than their counterparts in Europe.\n\nMicroHarvest nonetheless remains optimistic. The startup has already submitted a full dossier to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) seeking regulatory approval for human consumption of its fermented protein.\n\n“We’re really confident we’ll get it,” says Bekers. “We screened the full DNA of the strain, checked for any harmful potential, and submitted a very complete dossier.”\n\nMicroHarvest’s founders (left to right) Jonathan Roberz, Luisa Cruz, and Katelijne Bekers. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nFor now, MicroHarvest plans to scale through another customer segment: pets. Last year, MicroHarvest teamed up with Munich-based startup VegDog to launch its first commercial product — a vegan dog treat made with microbial protein.\n\nAnimal nutrition has fewer regulatory barriers than products for human consumption. The availability of conventional pet food and fish feed also falls short of current demand.\n\n“The pet and aquaculture industries are growing rapidly, but the supply of feed is not,” says Bekers, adding that pet food and fish feed already offer a strong path to profitability, even without the human market.\n\nMicroHarvest is now seeking Series B funding to open a new plant in 2027, with a planned capacity of 15,000 tonnes of product per year — 40 times its current output.\n\nBekers is tight-lipped on the location, but her fellow co-founder, Luísa Cruz, was eager to point out the benefits of doing business in her native Portugal.\n\n“If you want to operate a biotechnology company, Portugal is a great place to do it,” says Cruz, who earned her PhD in biotechnology at TU Delft in the Netherlands.\n\n“It has great universities for biotechnology and a lot of talent, which is why we decided to open our first plant here.”\n\nBacked by record private investment and fresh EU funding, fermentation-based proteins like MicroHarvest’s are bubbling with promise. But turning dead bacteria from pet snacks into mainstream meals won’t be easy.\n\nThe next few years will reveal if these microbial powders are a fleeting fad or the future of food. I’m sure cows will be silently betting on the latter outcome.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"microbes\", \"snacks\", \"regulatory\", \"proteins\", \"treats\", \"turning\", \"bacteria\", \"protein\", \"microbial\", \"bekers\", \"consumption\", \"dog\", \"startups\", \"food\", \"lab\", \"human\", \"dead\", \"lisbon\"]", "content_hash": "76fc56c6a0eda5daa039b0d88e8723b439cdd221f1c1df05ad8a73bc9b36c2d4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:46.775073+00:00"}

Regulatory bodies need to keep up by rolling out tighter regulations aimed at strengthening consumer protections and stabilising the market.\n\nAs EU lawmakers scramble to protect consumers, others worry they are smothering growth. Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty. The regulatory bodies are defending the public, but had restrictions been lighter, would HSBC have had more creative solutions for its customers, such as embedding personalised, data-first lending?\n\nBanks have been fearful of exploring innovative embedded lending solutions, as they were 15% more likely to receive formal enforcement action. However, in August 2024, HSBC decided the benefits were worth the compliance battle.\n\nWhile some argue that regulation can hinder innovation — with companies hesitant to invest in operations due to increased oversight — others state that additional regulation will increase innovation and, with that, see regulation as a key driver of their growth. So, who’s right?\n\nBreaking down the recent EU fintech regulations\n\nRecently, a few new regulations came into effect in the EU that have majorly impacted fintechs.\n\nDORA, implemented in January 2025, requires EU-established financial institutions (FIs) to implement processes and structures to help them respond to and recover from ICT-related disruption, providing them with extra digital resilience. Additionally, the AMLA is being introduced to give governments more assurance in combatting money laundering.\n\nDORA and the AMLA will apply to all FIs and their products and processes, but leave crypto outside their scope. That’s where MiCA comes in. Rolled out in December 2024, MiCA was drafted to protect individual crypto users.\n\nThe EU’s regulatory agenda — especially with the introduction of MiCA, DORA, and AMLA — is about tightening oversight. However, it is also part of a broader strategy to simplify and harmonise regulations, providing stability to the EU financial markets as a whole. The latest rulings strike a delicate balance between reassuring consumers and regulators, and easing the burden on regulated FIs.\n\nA new set of regulations may seem contradictory to the so-called Competitiveness Compass — published in January by the European Commission — which includes initiatives on simplifying and effectively implementing EU law. Nevertheless, these laws aim to replace fragmented national rules with unified EU-wide frameworks, making compliance clearer, faster, and more predictable.\n\nAs the digital finance ecosystem continues to accelerate, MiCA, DORA, and AMLA form a comprehensive framework. Collectively, they aim to balance innovation with financial stability, consumer protection, and security throughout the fintech sector.\n\nWill these updates support or slow innovation in fintech and banking?\n\nThis answer depends on the perspective. Recent EU regulations may slow innovation in the short term, particularly for the larger and well-established FIs like banks, but the future outlook looks more fruitful. These new rules are designed to support long-term stability.\n\nAs these three regulations require full harmonisation across the member states, they’re designed to reduce fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. A bigger and more uniform market will encourage cross-border activities, innovation, and competitiveness between fintechs and related service providers. The regulations also support the creation of better, more transparent products and services, helping to increase consumer and regulator trust, ultimately boosting customer adoption.\n\nIn short, this environment will offer greater opportunities for smaller and more agile fintechs to scale and compete long-term. For consumers and businesses, acting on the latest regulations results in more reliable and resilient services, which are much needed for essential functions like digital payments and lending.\n\nThese new regulations level the playing field, encouraging traditional banks and fintechs to compete on innovation and service quality rather than only on regulatory strengths. Moreover, a stable and secure financial system boosts the EU’s attractiveness as a hub for digital financial services, which will help make the union more attractive to new investors and innovations than the US.\n\nWhat investments will be required to meet these new standards?\n\nAdditional investment in governance and compliance structures is needed. Bigger, more well-established players may struggle to implement the required regulatory changes in their extensive processes and products. Those with existing compliance and governance processes will likely find the transition more seamless, while smaller fintechs may need to build these from scratch. The costs of their implementation present a potential hurdle.\n\nNavigating compliance is often a significant challenge for fintech startups and other smaller players. They’ll need to invest in knowledge, including how to correctly implement regulatory requirements into their processes and product designs, and translate these into operational business processes.\n\nOn top of this, investments in technology will need to be made as businesses must meet customer-facing requirements around transparency and language. For example, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will demand changes in know your customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring tools.\n\nHowever, compliance with the DORA regulatory framework is what will entail the biggest investment in technology, since digital operational resilience requires more robust security, backup, and testing methods. When working with partners who are fluent in compliance, the long-term payoff is clear.\n\nThe new finance model: Legacy institutions meet agile innovators\n\nNew technology has changed the way people interact with financial services, driving the growth of fintechs and increasing rivalry with established banks. One report found that 36% of 18-24-year-olds would choose fintech platforms over conventional financial institutions. Built on modern tech stacks and lean teams, fintechs’ agility allows them to react fast to changing consumer needs and market trends — a sharp contrast to the legacy infrastructure slowing down traditional banks.\n\nHowever, for both the old and new factions to succeed in Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape, traditional institutions and digital-native disruptors will need to depend on alliances. Effective partnerships between fintechs, banks, and FIs under the new EU regulations will be based on a mutual effort to enhance compliance, embrace innovation, and strengthen operational resilience. These collaborations are key for navigating complex regulations while delivering secure, innovative financial services.\n\nFintechs, FIs, customers, and merchants can also all benefit from Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships. For example, in the case of embedded lending, banks that partner with technology providers can scale quickly into new revenue opportunities, reaching new and existing customers outside of the direct scope of the bank, and thus try to keep pace with fintech competitors, without building their own technology in-house.\n\nIn fact, 41% of FIs have already implemented embedded finance solutions, and close to 50% have expanded their BaaS capabilities. Merchant customers then gain convenient, safe access to regulated, secure, innovative financial products from a trusted bank.\n\nAnother way that banks and fintechs can increase innovation while ensuring compliance is by engaging in collaborative models, including participation in regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments can support testing of new financial products and services under the supervision of regulators, providing a balance between innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe EU’s new wave of financial regulations isn’t just about tightening control — It’s part of a bigger push to simplify and unify rules across Europe. By uniforming patchwork national laws with consistent, EU-wide standards, compliance is now simpler to follow and predict. This uniformity and predictability can help encourage innovation while keeping consumer protection and financial stability front and centre. As fintech and banks collaborate, the future of digital finance in Europe is on track to be more open, safe, reliable, and inclusive.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"opinion\", \"compliance\", \"regulatory\", \"financial\", \"better\", \"fintech\", \"regulations\", \"europe\", \"innovation\", \"way\", \"fintechs\", \"regulate\", \"eu\", \"future\", \"banks\", \"digital\"]", "content_hash": "82915dce672f569d8b8d15c2f708b1453be1e0bcd65964d3688094326009eb6c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:48.119403+00:00"}

You’ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected — and sometimes disrespectful — judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?\n\nA pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and I’ve spent a decade doing casting for “Shark Tank” and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.\n\nI hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest — won by Dutch startup Tap Electric — captured what can make a founder’s story stand out. Whether you’re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:\n\nNerves\n\nYes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn’t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something — before, during, and after.\n\nEntrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.\n\nResearch\n\nA successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges’ backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can “do the most” with the funding or resources provided.\n\nDon’t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business\n\nWhatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.\n\nStart by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.\n\nLastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.\n\nWhat do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?\n\nAudience\n\nConnect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.\n\nInvite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links — all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.\n\nInternalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you’re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection – eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel — makes your message resonate.\n\nAsk\n\nYou would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.\n\nDon’t leave the most important part as a surprise — always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.\n\nIf the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.\n\nAs is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.\n\nContent\n\nA good pitch isn’t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.\n\nTreat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!\n\nRecord your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence “elevator pitch” and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.\n\nWrite a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience — what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained. Keep your community updated: this visibility can attract customers, partners, and even future investors. Leverage social media and other channels to amplify your story.\n\nA winning pitch is built on preparation, clarity, and connection. Research your judges, tell a crisp story, engage your audience, get specific about the resources and go-to-market strategy, make a confident and relevant ask, and then turn that one presentation into many pieces of compelling content.\n\nThese elements work together to make your pitch memorable and effective. A pitch including them can supercharge a business and accelerate your path towards growth.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"business\", \"judges\", \"mean\", \"insider\", \"competition\", \"audience\", \"ask\", \"pitch\", \"shark\", \"resources\", \"moment\", \"tank\", \"market\", \"pro\", \"lessons\"]", "content_hash": "ebc86269733a28b7dc25f62e5dd93c38b4258c905a1b9c024e49aee3ae02510c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:48.723969+00:00"}

Access to goods, services, and information not just for the few, but for everyone.\n\nVictoria Slivkoff, Head of Ecosystem at Walden Catalyst and Managing Director of Extreme Tech Challenge — a nonprofit uniting startups and VCs to accelerate progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — is excited for what lies ahead. In her view, the physical manifestation of AI could bring us closer to realising these ambitious goals.\n\n“Now we’re moving into the area of reasoning. AI is not just aggregating and organising information, it’s actually making predictions and drawing conclusions. How does that translate to the real world where robots can sense, learn, and interact with their surroundings?” she said to TNW founder Boris Veldhuijzen van Zaten in the latest episode of “Kia’s Next Big Drive.”\n\nWatch the full interview where Victoria and Boris discuss how we can leverage emerging technologies for positive global impact as they drive to TNW2025 in Kia’s 100% electric EV9 SUV.\n\nIn the not too distant future, we could be living in a world where robots are regularly navigating busy streets, offices, and classrooms. But as they become more common in our daily lives, is it them or us who will need to adapt most?\n\nRobots jumping the queue\n\nPicture this: you’re waiting for the elevator and a robot arrives at the same time. Who goes in first? If there’s only room for one, would you expect the robot to step aside, or would you treat it like a human and follow a “first come, first serve” approach?\n\nPast studies have found that most people expect service robots to be submissive, leading humans to prioritise themselves during conflicts, even in instances when a robot’s task was more urgent.\n\nWhat if a robot is carrying out a time specific task? The longer it waits until there are no humans in the queue, the longer it will take to complete it, whether it’s delivering a warm pizza or life saving medical supplies. So, how should robots navigate these social nuances without being ignored, undermined, or even bullied?\n\nThat’s what researchers aimed to find out last year in a study titled A Robot Jumping the Queue: Expectations About Politeness and Power During Conflicts in Everyday Human-Robot Encounters.\n\nThe researchers found that these robot-human interactions were more effective if participants expected an assertive robot which then asked politely for priority and entered first. But it’s not just robots that need to prepare to integrate into human society. The researchers highlighted that we may also need to rethink our attitudes and behaviours towards robots:\n\n“Should we maybe start thinking of service robots as having certain rights regarding priority if they fulfil human jobs with human responsibilities — or act as proxies for people? This might also help address the issue of robot bullying.”\n\nAs robots take on not only more responsibilities but also develop reason and sentience, at what point should we begin rethinking their social status?\n\nRobot teachers\n\nSocial robots — designed to communicate and interact with humans — are increasingly being used in caregiving, education, and mental health. In these settings, they help bridge service gaps, ease isolation, and offer emotional or learning support.\n\nUtrecht University of Applied Sciences is among those researching how robots can do more than just fill in; they can augment and enrich human-centred fields. For example:\n\nIn healthcare, how can robots be used to ease pre-procedure anxiety in children? Or help teach emotional skills for young patients who struggle with emotion regulation.\n\nAt last year’s Lowlands Science festival, the University showcased WOKEbot, a project exploring how a robot’s appearance and narrative voice (first vs. third person) influence human openness when discussing polarising topics.\n\n“Disagreements are timeless. People often manage to resolve them, but sometimes they simply can’t reach each other anymore. We saw this happen on a large scale not so long ago during the coronavirus pandemic. Are you for or against vaccination? When people dig in their heels and polarisation threatens, it can be helpful to have a neutral moderator,” said Dr. Mirjam de Haas. “The advantage of robots is that they are more neutral than humans. While you might be reserved with a person, a robot can make you more open and receptive to a different perspective.”\n\nAs part of her PhD research, Dr. Haas also conducted a number of successful experiments in using robotics to teach Dutch as a second language to students from linguistically diverse backgrounds. In her thesis defence, Dr. Haas explained that in the future, more and more students will fill classrooms. Having a robot aid will help facilitate learning for all students, including those with learning disabilities or those who are not yet fluent in Dutch.\n\nIs the world safe for robots?\n\nPerhaps the most recognisable robot in popular culture is The Terminator.

As sunshine bathes the leafy university campus, scientists inside the labs work under cool fluorescent light. Clad in green protective gear, they tend meticulously to test tubes within hermetically sealed cleanrooms. The containers hold the fruits of today’s labour: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).\n\nEach cell is barely a quarter the width of a human hair but wields remarkable power. MSCs reduce inflammation, repair damaged tissue, and modulate the immune system. They can treat chronic diseases and delay ageing. They may even prevent illness before it begins. But to become a mainstay of modern healthcare, MSCs must be produced at scale, affordably and reliably.\n\nThat seemed a distant prospect until recently, but the Karolinska scientists believe it’s approaching reality. They’re working for Cellcolabs, a Swedish startup formed to tackle the global scarcity of stem cell treatments.\n\nCellcolabs believes this shortage could soon be overcome. Thanks to a blend of scientific, regulatory, and technological advances, MSCs are edging towards the consumer market. Within the next decade, Cellcolabs aims to cut prices by up to 90%.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nIn the lab, the progress looks impressive. The latest harvest — cultivated from a single donation — has yielded 4.1 billion cells, enough for up to 200 standard doses.\n\nCellcolabs CEO Dr Mattias Bernow is in a buoyant mood. The 43-year-old sees today’s cultivation as just a taste of what’s to come.\n\n“I truly believe that we’re at an inflection point in the history of medicine,” he says.\n\nThe power of MSCs\n\nMSCs exist naturally in the body. A typical human contains billions of them. They act like a repair crew, fixing and tuning our insides. They can also be extracted, multiplied, and turned into medical treatments.\n\nKarolinska was the site of one of the field’s biggest milestones. In 2012, its Nobel Assembly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka. They discovered that mature cells can be made pluripotent — able to become almost any cell type in the body. The breakthrough rewrote the rules of regenerative medicine, igniting fresh regulatory momentum and fast-tracking stem cell therapies.\n\nMSCs are among the most promising examples. When injected, they release signals that trigger healing. The body then repairs itself.\n\nThey can treat countless conditions, from arthritis and heart disease to immune disorders. But first, you need to extract a small sample from a living, breathing human.\n\nCellcolabs sources its MSCs from the bone marrow of healthy donors aged 18 to 30. Just 50 millilitres — about a shot glass — produces up to 200 doses. The marrow naturally regenerates in six to eight weeks.\n\nThe donation process is quick and minimally invasive, but mass production is notoriously challenging. MSCs are living cells that require complex biomanufacturing, careful handling, and strict quality control, which makes scaling a formidable task.\n\nCellcolabs nonetheless sees industrial-scale production on the horizon — largely thanks to the pioneering research of Professor Katarina Le Blanc.\n\nLe Blanc’s landmark work showed MSCs could combat inflammatory and immune diseases. Her findings also proved that donated cells were suitable for therapeutic use — a crucial step for commercialisation.\n\nShe helped establish clinical-grade production standards, paving the way for large-scale trials and broader therapeutic use. Her research laid the foundations for Bernow’s inflection point.\n\n“This is not brain surgery or rocket science, but it is stem cells — so it’s quite close,” he says. “It’s super complex. And the only reason we can do this and move so fast is Professor Le Blanc’s research.”\n\nAs a haematologist, Le Blanc explored the potential of MSCs to support blood cancer patients. Her early clinical work focused on graft-versus-host disease — a severe and often fatal complication of bone marrow transplants. In a small trial, her team administered MSCs to patients who hadn’t responded to standard therapies. The impact was striking: more than half the participants survived. “The entire field just blew up,” says Bernow.\n\nLe Blanc continued pushing into new territory. One trial repaired vocal folds, restoring speech with minimal scarring. Another study used MSCs in COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation. The results were promising — but she hit a wall. “She ran out of cells,” Bernow says.\n\nScaling became a new focus. To expand treatment access, To expand treatment access, Le Blanc donated her research to Cellcolabs in 2021. Two years later, the Karolinska facility received production approval.\n\nProduction costs have fallen rapidly since then, fuelling hopes of a tenfold reduction. As prices drop and output scales, Bernow has his eyes on a target: “to truly democratise access to stem cells.”\n\nAfter spells as an ER physician, a consultant, and a startup founder, Mattias Bernow joined Cellcolabs in 2021. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nA new world of treatments\n\nBack in the lab, CPO Lina Sörvik leads a tour of the facilities. Previously a senior figure in big pharma, she joined Cellcolabs after being captivated by the potential of MSCs.\n\n“I was inspired by what they could do and by the idea of setting up a facility to produce them,” she says.\n\nOn a harvest day, her team’s work begins at 7:00 AM. Scientists don full protective gear and spend the day working inside the Karolinska cleanrooms. Once they’ve harvested the MSCs, the cells are tested for quality and frozen for future use.\n\nThe range of their applications is extensive. Middle-aged patients can gain relief from joint pain and injuries. Athletes can accelerate their recovery from injuries. The elderly could slow their ageing.\n\nBrian Johnson, a tech entrepreneur and celebrity longevity advocate, has also explored their powers. He had 300 million MSCs produced by Cellcolabs injected into his knees, shoulders, and hips.\n\nBernow lauds the variety of treatments. He says MSCs are interesting “for almost any indication.”\n\nHis path to them was winding. Raised in Malmö, southwestern Sweden, Bernow moved to the country’s capital to study at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE).\n\n“At that time, everybody wanted to become bankers in London,” he recalls. “That was not the future I saw for myself.”\n\nHe expanded his studies, earning a medical degree from Karolinska Institute and an MSc from SSE. After working as a clinical physician and management consultant, he co-founded Doctrin, a digital healthcare platform. Then Cellcolabs came calling: the leadership team needed a CEO and saw Bernow as a perfect fit.\n\n“I knew it was going to be more blood, sweat, and tears,” he says. “But the more I read, the more fascinated I became.”\n\nWhat fascinated him the most was the potential of MSCs to treat chronic conditions — the leading cause of death in the world. “That is why I think we’re truly at an inflection point in the history of medicine.”\n\nThe new antibiotics?\n\nBernow likes to share a quote from Joseph Martin, former Dean of Harvard Medical School: “Stem cell therapies have the potential to do for chronic diseases what antibiotics did for infectious diseases.”\n\nIt’s a bold comparison. Before Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, minor infections could be fatal. Healthy people died young or quickly aged.\n\nA century later, antibiotics let us live longer, better lives. Infectious diseases are no longer the leading causes of death. They’ve been supplanted by chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes. We’re also now living with more age-related illnesses, which severely reduce quality of life.\n\nMSCs, Bernow says, can help alleviate the growing burden of chronic illness. “But as a physician, what I find most interesting is the potential to prevent — or at least delay — the onset of disease.”\n\nHe recalls his time working in the ER, treating cardiac patients. A typical case was a middle-aged man who had just suffered his first cardiac event, now resigned to a lower quality and potentially shorter life. MSCs could have transformed that outcome.\n\nTheir regenerative and anti-inflammatory powers could support recovery — or even prevent the event altogether.\n\nTo reach this potential, Cellcolabs is targeting a new launchpad for scale: bioreactors.\n\nScaling for the future\n\nInside the Karolinska cleanrooms, Cellcolabs currently grows MSCs on flat surfaces in cell medium. Bioreactors offer a promising upgrade.\n\nBy vastly expanding cultivation surfaces and enabling automated, tightly controlled growth conditions, they could scale production far beyond what’s feasible with today’s methods.\n\nBioreactors could replace many of the manual methods currently used inside the cleanrooms. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nCellcolabs is developing its bioreactor platform with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Bernow expects it to transform production, multiplying MSC output many times over.\n\nFull-scale launch is slated for 2028. By then, Cellcolabs also hopes to have compelling new evidence for the benefits of MSCs.\n\nThe startup is currently involved in promising tests in the Bahamas and Abu Dhabi. Both locations have created progressive, patient-friendly, and ethically regulated frameworks for MSC trials, which have made them industry trailblazers.\n\nAcross their test sites, scientists are investigating treatments for a variety of conditions: musculoskeletal injuries, knee osteoarthritis, cardiovascular risk, arthritis, and age-related frailty.\n\nIn smaller territories such as these, it’s easier to update medical regulations for emerging therapies. If they’re successful, Bernow expects other nations to follow their lead and accelerate their support for MSCs. The potential benefits, he argues, are enormous.\n\nHe envisions the tiny cells shifting healthcare systems from reactive to preventative, cutting costs while tackling chronic conditions. Our lives wouldn’t just grow longer — they’d be healthier and happier.\n\nBernow draws a contrast with recent advances in Western medicine. We live longer, but our later years are often marred by frailty, illness, and a confined existence.\n\n“We’ve added years with lower life quality,” he says. “If stem cells can delay chronic disease onset, we can start prolonging our healthy lifespan.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean, he adds, that MSCs will create a fountain of youth. They won’t expand our lives forever, but they dramatically improve the time we have.\n\n“I want to spend the first 100 years being highly active and with my family — with my children, my grandchildren, and maybe even my great great grandchildren.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"medicine\", \"proclaims\", \"cellcolabs\", \"potential\", \"karolinska\", \"stem\", \"nears\", \"inflection\", \"cells\", \"mscs\", \"cell\", \"bernow\", \"chronic\", \"conditions\", \"mass\", \"startup\", \"production\", \"point\"]", "content_hash": "dd2308db432021a3bafbae98355a42723558f3b60fb80576193317aa296684bc", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:49.913811+00:00"}

Or seismic activity sensors built for construction that go on to detect submarines underwater. These ideas represent the promise of dual-use technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes. For the first time, the European Commission is explicitly proposing to fund them through programmes such as Horizon Europe. But as we race to embrace dual-use technologies, we face a pivotal choice: continue the old model where military applications drive innovation that civilians later adopt, or turn this paradigm on its head?\n\nTechnological innovation has long followed a well-trodden path: the military drives development, with civilian applications emerging as an afterthought. Consider GPS, arguably one of the most successful dual-use technologies in history. Originally developed by the US Department of Defence in the 1970s, it was designed for military positioning and navigation. Civilian access was restricted by “Selective Availability” — a feature that intentionally degraded accuracy to preserve the military’s advantage.\n\nThe full potential of GPS remained unrealised for decades until the deactivation of Selective Availability in 2000, instantly making it 10 times more accurate for civilian users. It quickly became a technology that most of us rely on every day, sparking innovations that transformed industries from agriculture to transportation. A 2019 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that GPS had generated $1.4 trillion in economic benefits.\n\nThis military-first approach, as we’ve seen with GPS, has dominated innovation funding for decades. Yet there’s compelling evidence that civilian-first approaches to dual-use technologies both better serve society’s immediate needs and ultimately produce more robust solutions for all applications — including military ones.\n\nThe traditional model overlooks a critical reality: civilian markets provide both scale and diversity of applications that drive innovation in ways the more specialised military sector cannot match. This pattern repeats across technological domains. Internet protocols developed for military communications found their greatest evolution in civilian applications, before returning to enhance military systems. The commercial drone industry has accelerated aerial innovation far beyond what military procurement alone could achieve.\n\nBy focusing on civilian-first use cases, innovation can leverage larger markets, more diverse applications, and faster development cycles. When technologies are developed with broad civilian applications in mind, they benefit from economies of scale that military-only development cannot achieve.\n\nThis is in part because civilian innovation faces fewer bureaucratic constraints. Military procurement cycles can span years or even decades, while civilian markets reward agility and rapid iteration. Developing for civilian use first allows technologies to evolve and mature faster than would be possible under traditional defence procurement timelines.\n\nThe most promising dual-use breakthroughs come from tackling fundamental technical challenges rather than specific operational functions. When innovators focus narrowly on military operations, they often miss the broader potential of their technologies. Scientific potential isn’t abstract; it only becomes real through implementation.\n\nThe challenge of developing robust navigation systems that work without GPS is a perfect example. A solution that enables delivery drones to navigate urban environments reliably could revolutionise logistics while simultaneously providing capabilities critical for defence operations. By emphasising civilian applications while acknowledging potential military uses, we create space for innovations that might otherwise never emerge.\n\nResearch from the European Commission on introducing a military tech aspect to the successor to Horizon Europe found that academic and research institutions would prefer to stick to the status quo, and keep Europe’s R&D funding solely for civilian technologies. By providing funding pathways that respect these preferences, we expand the talent pool, addressing critical technological challenges. Given the financial strains and political pressures in US higher education, Europe could attract top innovators from across the Atlantic by creating an environment aligned with their core values.\n\nAs Europe intensifies its focus on strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty, dual-use technologies will play an increasingly important role. The EU’s recent moves to allow dual-use funding through programs such as Horizon Europe represent an important shift in how we approach innovation. But as these initiatives take shape, they must avoid simply replicating the traditional military-first model.\n\nBy prioritising civilian use cases while acknowledging military applications, we can leverage market forces, attract diverse talent, and produce more robust technologies for all applications.\n\nYet for dual-use development to be truly durable, civilian and military technologies must no longer be siloed – we have to bridge the gap between civilian first R&D and military use cases. Given the chasm that exists between the way these two sectors operate, this will need to be an active process. Initiating more open knowledge exchange would better apply insights and learnings from both worlds back and forth. For bodies that focus on military technology, it is time to incubate a civilian equivalent. Conversely, organisations like mine — SPRIND, the German federal agency for disruptive innovation — focused on civilian technology, should also explore military applications.\n\nThe challenges we face — from climate change and energy security to supply chain resilience — require technological solutions that serve multiple purposes. The old dichotomy between civilian and military innovation is increasingly outdated in a world where the most powerful technologies inevitably serve both domains.

But he’s begun to wonder if candidates’ answers are genuine, even on video calls. “I can see their eyes shifting across the screen,” he says. “Then they come back with the perfect answer to a question.” The trust gap between employer and jobseeker is widening, and it’s fast becoming one of the trickiest knots in modern hiring.\n\n\n\nFrom ChatGPT-polished CVs to full-blown applications submitted by bots, GenAI has hit the job market hard and gone fully mainstream. For a sizable generation of jobseekers — 68% of European tech workers were actively looking for a new role at the end of 2024 — it’s commonplace to use AI to tweak a CV or even complete an entire application.\n\n\n\nTools like Sonara, LazyApply, and JobCopilot have made it easy to shoot off dozens of applications in a day. In June, data from TestGorilla found that just over a third (37%) of UK jobseekers are using AI to complete applications. Among early-career candidates, it jumps to 60%, up from 38% the year before, according to Bright Network, which connects graduates and young professionals with recruiters.\n\nStartups are at the forefront of this AI arms race. With smaller teams, shorter runways, and a culture of speed, they’re particularly exposed to this strange new world of suspiciously shiny applicants and AI-assisted code challenges. Most aren’t fighting it: 85% of employers now actively accept AI-assisted applications. But their acceptance doesn’t equal apathy. Amid a deluge of blatant AI use, how are Europe’s most agile companies working out who’s being real — and if they’re worth bringing onboard?\n\nA new normal\n\nUsing AI to troubleshoot and tailor a CV has become par for the course. For most jobseekers, GenAI acts like a digital sidekick — smoothing grammar, sharpening phrasing, and cranking out tailored applications faster than ever. According to Canva’s January survey of 5,000 employees across countries including the UK, France, Spain, and Germany, 45% had used GenAI to build or improve a resume — and have yielded positive results. But hiring managers aren’t entirely sold. In the UK, 63% believe candidates should disclose if AI played a role in their application materials, signifying that trust is on shaky ground.\n\nOther research suggests that attitudes depend on the context. A global survey by Experis (part of workforce giant ManpowerGroup) found that 28% of tech leaders are fine with AI if used to personalise a resume or cover letter, 26% with help on problem-solving tests, and 24% even with answering interview questions. Just 15% said AI use is unacceptable across the entire job application process.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nFor Duco van Lanschot, co-founder of fintech startup Duna, it’s all about the role. “If an engineer used ChatGPT to polish a written application, fine. That’s not the job. But for a growth or sales hire to use it very obviously is a big red flag,” he says. “The job itself involves public-facing comms and emailing stakeholders — and in a sea of generic, AI-generated copy, I want us to be as human as possible.”\n\nTech employers and startups are adapting — albeit in different ways and at different speeds. Some are setting ground rules for usage, some are bulking out human-only processes, and some are cutting away entire parts of the “traditional” hiring approach. “AI hasn’t broken hiring,” says Marija Marcenko, Head of Global Talent Acquisition at SaaS platform Semrush. “But it’s changed how we engage with candidates.”\n\nGoodbye to CVs\n\nIn the words of Khyati Sundaram, ethical AI hiring expert and CEO of Applied, we’re in the middle of “an AI-on-AI war.” And in the fallout, traditional application materials are losing their sway. In the tech sector, cover letters fell into obsolescence long ago, and CVs are next on the chopping block. “A huge upside is that it’s exposing résumés for what they are — a broken artefact,” says Sundaram, whose team works with the likes of Unicef UK, BLab, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. “Putting résumés into keyword scanners or GenAI tools isn’t solving the problem for those hiring, because when it comes to the interview, the candidate falls apart,” she explains.\n\nInstead of cover letters and cut-and-paste CVs, employers are turning to structured questionnaires and skill-based tasks — tools that measure how someone thinks, not just how well they can write a prompt. “Skill-based hiring is no longer just a tech hiring thing,” Sundaram adds. “We’re seeing that crop up in more white-collar roles across the board.” According to TestGorilla, 77% of UK employers now use skills tests to evaluate candidates, with the same proportion saying these tests outperform CVs in predicting job success. This should have a positive effect in the long term: LinkedIn’s Economic Graph Institute found that a skills-based approach globally could expand talent pools by 6.1x, and help broaden gender and minority representation.\n\nAt Semrush, the shakeup is already in full swing. Hiring managers are trained to sniff out fluency without depth, spotting signs of AI in real-time coding challenges or task-based interviews. “We’ve replaced the usual ‘Tell me about yourself’ prompts with in-depth interviews that explore experience, soft skills, and thinking patterns,” says Marcenko. “It’s hard to fake those, with or without AI.”\n\n\n\nApplied’s own system uses a mix of automation and human insight. “We don’t believe in AI detectors — they’re rarely accurate, so we train reviewers to pattern match like an AI, comparing submissions to known GPT outputs,” explains Sundaram. “If five responses sound suspiciously identical, humans can flag them.”\n\nElsewhere, startups are getting more creative and more human. Alessandro Bonati, Chief People Officer at travel scaleup WeRoad, has ditched cover letters in favour of more creative, human-centric formats like curated portfolios or briefs of the “show, don’t tell” type. The company, which has over 210 staff in offices across Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, actively encourages candidates to use AI. “But that’s also accompanied by traditional in-person interviews to assess candidates’ thinking, communication, and cultural fit in real time,” says Bonati. His team also leans on real-time scenario-based exercises that reflect how candidates would collaborate, not just how well they can prepare.\n\nThe return of the reference and in-person interviews\n\nAnother ripple effect: references are back on the menu. Santiago Nestares, co-founder of the accounting startup DualEntry, is spending more time face-to-face on Zoom with candidates. “Experience is hard to fake,” says Nestares. “You can usually tell when someone’s just read about something versus having lived it.” He’s also going deeper on references; not just the usual ones, as those are always glowing, but backchannel conversations with people who’ve worked with them directly. “It’s so we can find out how someone handles pressure, works with a team, and shows up day to day,” says Nestares.\n\nThrough building the team for Connectd, a platform which enables angel investors and founders to effectively manage their startups, Samuel has noticed that candidates are cutting through the lack of trust by building more social proof around themselves. “For hiring managers, instead of taking a candidate’s word for it, we’re diving into references more than ever,” he says.\n\nThe dreaded take-home task is on the way out now too. Unpaid and time-consuming, candidates have long despised them, and now that there’s the option of using GenAI to fake it (until they make it), employers are souring on them too. Live interviews, technical walk-throughs, scenario-based challenges, and even roleplay simulations are becoming the new standard, particularly in product, design, and marketing roles. “AI detectors are being used,” says Andreas Bundi, founder of Berlin-based HR consultancy Bundls. “But most companies are asking — why bother with take-homes when you can just do a live assessment?”\n\n\n\nBundi, who works with clients like Pitch, Cradle and Telli, says hybrid companies with mandatory office days are ditching take-homes to keep the interview process aligned with on-site work. With more candidates on the market, jobseekers are going further — relocating, or even flying in for interviews.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, well-funded companies are increasingly comfortable bringing people on-site for tasks. “When travel isn’t possible, I’ve arranged in-person meetings with interviewers who happen to be nearby,” says Bundi. “I recently scheduled interviews around a conference both the candidate and interviewer were attending.” This “networking meets hiring approach” works surprisingly well.\n\nBundi says he sees that it’s the AI-first companies that are more relaxed about candidates using tools like ChatGPT — but it’s rarely made explicit. Recently, one of his Lead Data Scientists blew an interview by manually wrangling messy data instead of automating it. “They thought they needed to demonstrate their raw coding skills,” says Bundi. “But the company wanted strategy, not a human data janitor. That’s what ChatGPT is for.” As AI becomes standard, candidates and companies will need to get clearer on where it fits in the process. Until then, these frictions will continue.\n\nHire for skills and values, not a job description\n\nDespite the ubiquity of AI-powered applications, most companies still haven’t formalised their approach. “It’s confusing for candidates, as some companies don’t want AI used in applications, even though those same roles involve AI tools every day,” says Sundaram. Indeed, 40% of employers using BrightNetwork services said they still haven’t set guidelines for AI usage in their processes, although 28% plan to for the next recruitment season. Of those who have set guidelines, 44% don’t allow candidates to use AI.\n\n\n\n“The vanguard employers want everyone to use it and demonstrate their AI literacy,” says Sundaram. Some of Applied’s clients have even added the question: ‘How will you use AI in this job?’ She warns, however, that many of the quick fixes employers reach for — AI detectors, video screening with facial tracking, voice sentiment tools — raise huge ethical concerns. “If companies are tracking facial expressions for emotional nuance, it gets creepy,” she says. “Where do we draw the line?”\n\n\n\nInstead, she argues, the fix will lie in redefining what candidates are being tested for. Applied has shifted from traditional job architecture to task architecture, evaluating not just skills, but values like resilience, adaptability, and mission alignment. “These are the human traits that will matter even more as jobs evolve,” she says. “Especially in startups, where everyone’s a generalist.”\n\nWithout doubt, generative AI is fundamentally reshaping the hiring process. The most forward-looking startups aren’t resisting the change — they’re building better processes around it. CVs may be broken, cover letters outdated, and applications increasingly synthetic — but the real differentiator is still very human. “We need people who can adapt, not just apply,” says Sundaram. “Because the job they’re hired for today may not exist in six months.” Startups that understand this and structure their hiring accordingly aren’t just future-proofing their teams, they’re rewriting the rules of work for the AI era.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"aionai\", \"employers\", \"applications\", \"candidates\", \"recruitment\", \"sundaram\", \"rewriting\", \"ai\", \"companies\", \"playbook\", \"theyre\", \"job\", \"human\", \"hiring\", \"war\"]", "content_hash": "a4f6b086bdd4bcd929bb2ca4696119aa3ef3cfbb6a6037db5f55c2e5b18487ea", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:51.122735+00:00"}

Then there is Asia — with China’s rapid developments and Japan and South Korea’s deep legacy in robotics. Headlines still gravitate toward billion-dollar budgets, rapid hardware iterations, and slick simulation reels.\n\nBehind the noise, though, another development is unfolding in Europe — quieter, but potentially far more consequential. The next chapter of humanoid robotics may be defined not by who moves first or builds the flashiest prototypes, but by who moves with the discipline and consistency required. And Europe has the potential to lead this new era.\n\nRegulation as strategy\n\nIn most conversations about innovation, regulation is framed as a brake. In Silicon Valley, it’s often seen as a hurdle to scale or a signal of bureaucratic overreach. But Europe — particularly in AI and robotics — is rewriting that narrative. With the AI Act now adopted, the EU is the first region to offer comprehensive legal clarity around the deployment of high-risk AI systems, including humanoid robots.\n\nWe must also consider that, eventually, other countries will likely adopt regulatory frameworks that align broadly with the EU’s, even if they’re less stringent. By designing with European standards from the outset, we’ll be well-positioned to adapt quickly as new regulations emerge elsewhere.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nThis clarity matters. When investors and industrial partners can reliably assess compliance risks, they’re most likely to commit resources. In a field as complex and potentially disruptive as robotics, clear rules don’t slow down progress — they de-risk it.\n\nEurope has also introduced or updated several other regulations that directly impact robotics:\n\nThe Product Liability Directive now includes software and AI, reducing ambiguity and incentivising safer design practices.\n\nThe General Product Safety Regulation streamlines cross-border market entry with harmonised safety standards.\n\nThe Machinery Regulation defines clearer certification routes for robotic systems.\n\nTogether, these frameworks give the EU a coherent and predictable regulatory environment. Yes, it’s tough, but given the implications, this provides exactly what the humanoid sector needs: clarity.\n\nDeployment, not demos\n\nWhile the US often relies on innovation funded by Big Tech monopolies and China leans on state-driven manufacturing strategies, Europe’s robotics sector is built on modular collaboration. Startups and research labs spin out into well-funded clusters, often supported by EU-backed initiatives like RI4EU and EIC Accelerator. These programs offer access to testbeds, pilot funding, and collaborative R&D networks.\n\nFurthermore, Europe’s geographic and industrial structure gives it a special advantage: close proximity to real-world use cases. Having neighbouring logistics hubs, manufacturing zones, and retail chains in contiguity helps speed iteration and aligns development with the continent’s actual operational pain points. McKinsey estimates that in some of Europe’s critical sectors — including retail and logistics — payroll alone amounts to $1.7 trillion (€1.55 trillion). This makes automation highly profitable and ripe for disruption.\n\nThese factors have played a key role in the strategy of Humanoid, the robotics company I founded in the UK last year. Our goal isn’t just to impress on stage; it’s far more important that we seamlessly integrate innovations into real workflows. For this, we’ve adopted a simple, modular design philosophy: a wheeled base that suits logistics environments, accelerated by simulation plus feedback from real industry trials. We believe that hype must be based on reality — a mindset that’s drawing US investors to European robotics.\n\nThis shift is already reflected in funding dynamics. Neura Robotics’ €120mn funding round in January 2025 was one of the largest in European robotics to date. And investors are now betting on full-stack teams with credible deployment strategies — instead of merely speculative tech.\n\nHumanoid’s latest robot, HMND 01, was introduced in a video earlier this year. Credit: Humanoid\n\nA better fit for the future of work\n\nBeyond reducing uncertainty, European regulation also helps encode values that shape how humanoid robots are developed and deployed. The AI Act requires high-risk systems — including those used in workplaces, public spaces, and healthcare settings — to meet strict safety, transparency, and human oversight standards.\n\nSuch a framework fosters trust, which is essential for robots operating in sensitive environments like factories, hospitals, or elderly care facilities. Europe’s emphasis on traceability and ethical co-development goes beyond mitigating risk — it creates the conditions for adoption at scale, where safety and dignity are non-negotiable.\n\nAdditionally, this approach helps position robots as partners. By designing for augmentation rather than displacement — as often seen in the US — European startups are modelling a more human-centred approach to automation. They’re also offering an alternative to the dominant narrative that robots will replace humans in critical roles.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that some jobs aren’t meant for people, as they hinder individuals from reaching their full potential. For instance, a humanoid could take over the task of moving boxes around a warehouse all day. This is not simply a replacement; it is an augmentation of existing automation capabilities, which empowers people to find more purpose-driven work.\n\nThat distinction comes into sharper focus when we look at the places where humanoids are most needed, such as logistics hubs, clinics, and care homes. These environments have real spatial and regulatory constraints and little room for error. The tasks there are repetitive but require precision, and people are extremely busy. In these settings, robots need to quietly support the flow of work, not interrupt it. That requires thoughtful integration, which means responding at the right pace, handling objects predictably, and, yes, staying out of the way when needed.\n\nThese are practical challenges shaped by day-to-day routines, not only engineering feats. And, from our vantage point, Europe’s cautious, user-informed development model is well-suited to meet them.\n\nSupply chains and strategic independence\n\nThere are still concerns in European robotics that need to be addressed. As of 2025, China controls 63% of the humanoid hardware supply chain, from rare-earth magnets to key actuators. However, we’re now seeing global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) based in Europe partnering with humanoid creators early on to co-develop hardware components together. This strategy can mitigate the risk of over-dependence.\n\nOn the other hand, while the US dominates in AI software, few actors globally offer fully-integrated stacks. We see some moves in that direction in the US and China, and Europe — which is still dependent on imports — must learn to navigate this space assertively.\n\nCalls for supply diversification are growing. In June 2025, Benjamin Krieger, from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA), emphasised the need for stronger EU supply chain routes due to China’s export controls on rare-earth elements. In the US, analysts are sounding similar alarms.\n\nTo reduce dependency, Europe will need to support local manufacturing of key components, incentivise alternative sourcing, and form trade alliances outside Beijing’s orbit.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe next phase of humanoid robotics will not be won by whoever moves fastest. It will be won by whoever builds best.\n\nWhat will this require? To start, bolstering funding and support mechanisms that help innovations advance through the later stages of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale — and move from pilots to industrial-grade rollouts. Second, forging industrial partnerships that begin during prototyping, not after. Third, policy agility to fast-track certification while maintaining the highest safety standards.\n\nWhat’s at stake isn’t just who secures the most patents — we’ve already seen that happen without meaningful real-world deployment. The true challenge is whether we can build systems that integrate safely into human environments, uphold public trust, and address the real concerns people have — from privacy and transparency to everyday safety and interaction.\n\nEurope doesn’t need to mimic Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Instead, it needs to double down on what it already does well: interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical tech design, and industrial pragmatism.\n\nThe global humanoid race is not a sprint — it’s a long-term infrastructure project. And if we get it right, Europe could build the future’s most trusted workforce —- one that collaborates with humans and changes the world, one robot at a time.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"european\", \"safety\", \"humanoid\", \"ai\", \"race\", \"europe\", \"robotics\", \"eu\", \"robots\", \"win\", \"europes\", \"need\", \"quietly\"]", "content_hash": "8029ef43a1e99617e17b64c4dd64eba16fadbfd6d11ad701563f5949b3ab9754", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:51.707525+00:00"}
{"url": "https://thenextweb.com/news/eu-ai-act-job-displacement", "title": "Can the EU's Act protect jobs without stifling innovation?", "authors": "[\"Ray Fernandez\", \"Story By\"]", "published": "2025-08-01T06:00:02+00:00", "text": "While the US has largely pursued AI development with minimal regulatory oversight, Europe has taken a markedly different approach. The Data Protection Act, the GDPR, and the recent AI Act — aligned more closely with local workers’ laws and unions — have set the continent on a separate path.\n\nA recent joint study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Poland’s National Research Institute (NASK) found that Europe — along with Asia — tops the list of most exposed regions to AI, far surpassing the Americas. With studies finding that one in four jobs are at risk of being transformed by AI globally, the impact in Europe — a region which faces a significant shortage of skilled workers — has become a pressing concern.\n\n“In many ways, it’s too early to tell where the AI wave will take us — we’ve only seen a fraction of its capabilities so far, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying,” Adam Maurer, COO at Connecting Software, a tech company operating across Europe, told TNW.\n\nIn recent years, Big Tech companies have frequently carried out mass layoffs, driven both by revenue concerns and the belief that AI can take over many of the functions of employees from entry to mid-level, Maurer said.\n\nSome of these AI-driven layoffs have effectively targeted low performers, but other initiatives have been problematic. At Klarna, for example, they had concerning impacts on the business.\n\nKlarna, a Swedish fintech company that fired 700 workers and replaced them with AI, recently announced it will hire humans back again. The company’s CEO admitted to having made a “mistake” when replacing workers with AI.\n\n“It’s very clear that AI will definitely replace some jobs,” Maurer said. “On the other side of the coin, I think it will make some other jobs far more valuable.”\n\nIn the EU, labour laws and regulations will shape the impact on jobs. Tech leaders believe they could lead to an AI future that benefits both workers and businesses.\n\nThe talk among executives\n\nMaurer said there may be some expectation for the EU to step in and regulate job displacement. However, he argued that would stagnate growth and discourage startups from doing business in the union.\n\nBut not every business leader agrees. Displacement will happen, but not because of AI, said Volodymyr Kubytskyi, head of AI at MacPaw, a Ukrainian software company developing solutions for Apple devices.\n\n“AI disrupts the traditional logic and processes of work,” Kubytskyi told TNW. “The real question is, ‘Can we redesign work processes before this outdated system collapses?’” To prevent the system from collapsing, leaders must stop thinking of AI as a quick-win or cost-saving tool, he said.\n\nKubytskyi argued that while the AI Act was necessary to set a baseline for the industry, it doesn’t account for potential job disruption, which is a gap in the regulatory landscape.\n\n“To account for this, the AI Act should be updated, but it’s unlikely that this will happen soon,” he said.\n\nRoman Eloshvili, founder of ComplyControl, a UK compliance company, told TNW that the AI Act targets safety, transparency, and ethics, but falls short on socio-economic impact, especially on jobs. “So, amendments are necessary,” he said.\n\n“I expect that, over time, some of them, such as mandates for employer-led upskilling or protections for displaced workers, will appear to address workforce implications more effectively.”\n\nWill the AI Act become outdated or even counterproductive, especially if its stringent compliance mechanisms amplify inequalities in access to AI benefits? Or is it too early in the game to amend the law?\n\nKris Jones, who leads the engineering team in Belfast for iVerify, believes it’s too soon to make changes. He said the AI Act’s risk-based framework already strikes a delicate balance between protecting fundamental rights and giving innovators room to breathe.\n\nAmending the regulation is not the only policy idea discussed among executives. Jones told TNW that member states have other levers to pull. “One idea floating around is an ‘AI token’ tax,” he said.\n\nA token tax would enable governments to generate revenue from AI usage that is producing income. These funds would then be redistributed through measures such as reskilling programs or support for affected industries.\n\nDario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, recently told Axios that the concept could offset the inevitable wipeout of millions of entry-level white-collar jobs lost to AI.\n\n“Measures like that can cushion any job shocks without putting a blanket lid on innovation,” Amodei said.\n\nAre clashes with European labour and trade unions inevitable?\n\nEuropean labour and trade union bodies have often been ignored in the debate over AI job displacement. But many of them have already made official statements expressing concerns over AI.\n\nAhead of the Paris AI Summit in February 2025, the ETUC, representing over 45 million European workers, issued an open letter about AI’s dangers. It warned that any efforts to ensure AI has “a positive impact on workers in the labour markets, quality jobs, and society will be annulled if AI is monopolised by a handful of tech companies”.\n\nThe previous August, UK unions, including Accord and Unite, had called for regulations to protect workers from AI. They also proposed reskilling programs for workers, reminded companies of their transparency obligations, and emphasised the need for union consultations. They said that they intended to protect workers’ rights against AI‑driven hiring and firing, as well as defend IP rights for creative professionals.\n\nWe asked tech firms whether they expect companies to face challenges with labour laws and unions in Europe.\n\n“Undoubtedly,” Eloshvili from ComplyControl said. “European robust worker protections and active unions present both a safeguard and challenges for AI integration.”\n\nUnions will demand transparency and worker involvement in AI deployment as automation threatens certain jobs, he said. “Firms that try to impose AI solutions without dialogue definitely risk conflict and backlash.”\n\nDespite the challenges, Eloshvili said it isn’t a zero-sum game. “When businesses and unions work together — for example, under joint upskilling initiatives — AI can become an effective tool for improving working conditions,” he said.\n\nKubytskyi from MacPaw agreed that challenges will arise on this front and described the pushback from unions and workers’ organisations as “understandable”.\n\n“Clarity, structure, and communication are vital,” he said. “If you integrate new [AI] agents into existing workflows without involving people, you’ll get pushback, and for a good reason.”\n\nKubytskyi also believes that conflict can be avoided. “To prevent this, we need to show people what AI does, what guardrails are in place, and why it will benefit the team.”\n\nJorge Riera, the CEO of big data and AI consultancy Dataco, agrees. “The most effective AI deployments are strategic,” he said, adding that careful analysis is needed to decipher which work tasks should be offloaded to AI.\n\nFlipping the script to develop AI the ‘European way’\n\nJones from iVerify explained that regulations, trade unions, and workers’ rights in Europe are not necessarily an obstacle and could, in fact, be beneficial.\n\nHe believes companies should embed responsible AI, bias checks, explainability, and human oversight loops into each product cycle. That way, they can transform the AI Act from a compliance hurdle into a market differentiator, Jones explained.\n\n“Europe can’t sit out the AI wave; the Bay Area now fields roughly half of the world’s unicorns and hoovers up 80% of GenAI funding, while much of the European workforce is ageing and a quarter of young Europeans can’t find work,” Jones said.\n\nEurope is not only facing competition from the usual suspects — Asia and the US — but also from Latin America, where heavy investment in technology is underway.\n\nMahesh Raja, chief growth officer of Ness Digital Engineering, which operates innovation centres in the UK and Czechia, highlighted how this lack of similar investment is hurting business. “Fifty-three percent of small- and medium-size businesses found the initial cost of AI implementation to be much higher than anticipated. We need to address the adoption challenges that stem from legacy IT infrastructures and improve the collective time-to-value for this emerging technology,” he said.\n\nHowever, Europe’s stringent regulations can become a premium brand for banks, healthtechs, and any sector that values trust and data privacy.\n\n”Europe shouldn’t just photocopy Silicon Valley,” Jones said. He believes the continent’s strengths lie in a combination of factors, including upskilling and STEM PhD graduates per capita. The privacy-first and safe AI leadership — solidified in regulation — can bolster the package.\n\n“Overall, Europe should push hard on AI augmentation and skill-building, or we’ll fall further behind,” Jones said. “But do it Europe’s way, leveraging our ethical governance, deep industrial know-how, and cross-border talent pipelines instead of importing the Valley’s blitz-and-break culture wholesale.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"jobs\", \"stifling\", \"work\", \"workers\", \"act\", \"told\", \"ai\", \"europe\", \"innovation\", \"unions\", \"labour\", \"protect\", \"eus\", \"jones\"]", "content_hash": "d5d63c25b67f85daae93803735f2880db3af5f7910d11a2d0bcb679009816f51", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:53.141941+00:00"}

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "The Oura Ring 4 (left) has receded sensors that make it more comfortable compared to Oura Ring 3 (right). Nina Raemont/ZDNET\n\nConsidering buying an Oura Ring to track your sleep, activity, or stress? Oura is taking up to $200 off its third-gen smart ring, depending on the finish and size. This deal applies to the Oura Ring Heritage and Oura Ring Horizon, two third-generation smart rings.\n\nAlso: The Oura Ring 4 is ZDNET's best product of the year\n\nThe deal on the earlier generation Oura Ring 3 is so low because Oura recently unveiled the Oura Ring 4. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive and well-designed smart ring that blows its competitors (and even the Ring 3) out of the water. But does that mean you should buy the newer Ring 4 over the less expensive Ring 3 that's on sale right now? It all depends on what features you prioritize in a smart ring. I break down the differences below.\n\nSpecifications\n\n\n\nOura Ring 3 Oura Ring 4 Battery life Up to seven days Up to eight days Charging time Between 20-80 minutes Between 20-80 minutes Sizes 6-13 4-15 Material Titanium exterior and epoxy interior Fully titanium Finishes Black, brushed titanium, gold, silver, rose gold Black, brushed silver, gold, silver, rose gold Starting price $300 $350\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 4 if...\n\n\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You prioritize comfort\n\nOne of the highlights of the new Oura Ring 4 is its smart sensors. Oura Ring 4's smart sensing technology uses 18 signal pathways, compared to the Oura Ring 3's eight, to capture more accurate data with fewer gaps.\n\nSo, what does that have to do with comfort? These smart sensors allow the raised sensor domes that stick out on the Oura Ring 3's interior to flatten and recede on the Oura Ring 4 for a more comfortable and less constrictive wear. I wore the Oura Ring 3 for around eight months, and one of the few gripes I had with it was that the three domes would cling to the inside of my finger, resulting in dents that remained on my skin for days after.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 4 for weeks. Here's why it's the best health tracker right now\n\nThe Oura Ring 4 is far more comfortable than the Oura Ring 3 thanks to the receded smart sensing technology. It's noticeably slimmer, both on the interior of the ring and the exterior, which results in a lighter feel. If you are more sensitive to health trackers around your wrist or finger and get easily annoyed with jewelry, I'd suggest the Oura Ring 4.\n\n2. You want a smaller or larger ring size\n\nSherin Shibu\n\nExpanded sizing is one of the major hardware upgrades that came with the Oura Ring 4. Where the Oura Ring 3 offers sizes six through 13, the Oura Ring 4 offers sizes four through 15. That's four more sizes on the larger and smaller ends of the spectrum. If you couldn't buy the Oura Ring 3 because the available sizes didn't fit your finger, the Oura Ring 4 might fit you better.\n\n3. You want a longer battery life\n\nThe Oura Ring 3 boasts a battery life of up to seven days, though I normally got around four. The newer Oura Ring 4 boasts a battery life of up to eight days, but during my testing I got around 5 and a half.\n\nIf you forget to charge your tech constantly and want a smart ring that you can put on for a few days and not worry about, then I'd recommend the Oura Ring 4. If you are adamant about daily charging, however, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3.\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 3 if...\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You just want the newest software\n\nMost of the software updates that came to the Oura Ring 4 also are available on the Oura Ring 3. That includes automatic heart rate monitoring during workouts, the Oura app redesign, upgraded daytime stress features that help contextualize your physiological stress, and many new Oura Labs features you can test out, like meal logging.\n\nAutomatic heart rate monitoring continues Oura's mission of autonomously logging health data with little assistance from the ring wearer. This means that, on top of the automatic workout detection feature, the Oura Ring now can monitor and record your heart rate during these activities without you clicking on the Record workout HR button.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 3 -- and it totally beat my Apple Watch\n\nOura upgraded its daytime stress feature by implementing the daily tags people use to document their meals, workouts, illnesses, and moods onto the daytime stress timeline. Let's say you just had an argument with a coworker and find that your heart rate is elevated. If you log that in the app, it will include that tag into the daytime stress timeline.\n\nLastly, there are a few experimental features Oura Ring 3 users can take advantage of through Oura Labs, which is also available on both rings. One of my favorite features I tested was the meal-logging feature that uses your camera and AI to document what you're eating (and when).\n\nThe AI was able to detect that I was eating yogurt with berries and bananas one morning, despite the yogurt being fully picked over and mixed with the other ingredients.\n\n2. You don't want to spend more money\n\nYou can buy an Oura Ring 3 for up to $200 right now. The third-generation smart ring has been on sale since Oura unveiled a newer generation. If a starting price of $350 (plus that $6 monthly subscription to access all your data) is a little too much for you, the Oura Ring 3 is substantially cheaper.\n\n3. Comfort isn't a concern\n\nIf you own an Oura Ring 3 and aren't disturbed by the raised sensors or the chunkier build, I don't see a need for you to upgrade to the Oura Ring 4. If you don't own either ring and are trying to make a buying decision, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3 if you are unbothered by a tight and raised dome around your finger.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"sizes\", \"vs\", \"buy\", \"right\", \"oura\", \"features\", \"days\", \"sensors\", \"older\", \"newest\", \"discounted\", \"smart\", \"ring\", \"stress\", \"opt\"]", "content_hash": "8bfe6d67475ef7abdc53eeb95171bbca33677b332ccb0bbadccb85f08b2f9891", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:00.634234+00:00"}

Amazon Echo speakers are the best way to bring Alexa into your smart home. The Echo Pop and Echo Dot, Amazon's two most compact smart speakers, are the most popular and affordable Echo devices available.\n\nAmazon's new Alexa+ is launching gradually over the next few weeks. While the company is prioritizing the larger Echo Shows in the initial release, Amazon says that after you get access to Alexa+ on an Echo Show 8,10,15, or 21, it will be available on all of your Echo devices, with the exception of some older generations.\n\nAlso: Amazon just gave Alexa its biggest upgrade in a decade - and old Echo devices will support it\n\nThe Echo Pop is newer than the Echo Dot and is marketed as the company's most compact speaker. At about two-thirds of the size of the already compact Echo Dot, the Echo Pop is best suited for small rooms and can be tucked away in the corner of a desk. The slightly larger Echo Dot is about the size of an Apple HomePod mini and delivers more potent sound.\n\nRead on to learn more about how the Echo Pop and Echo Dot compare and which is best suited for which sort of user.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Pop if...\n\n\n\nHere's an Amazon Echo Pop next to an Apple Magic Mouse, for reference. Maria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need a compact speaker\n\nThe Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and most affordable smart speaker, perfect for a small room -- such as a dorm or a kid's room. Because it doesn't feature a screen and can go unnoticed, it's a simple way to introduce yourself to the Alexa ecosystem or give someone access to Amazon's voice assistant in a simple, unintimidating way.\n\nReview: Amazon Echo Pop review: A portable smart speaker for small spaces\n\nThe Echo Pop is a perfect option if you're looking for a compact speaker for your kid's desk, a guest room, or an area you don't use often. It can be unreliable in larger rooms or when tasked with bigger assignments, which brings me to my next point.\n\n2. You plan on everyday music streaming, podcasts, or audiobooks\n\nThe Echo Pop is surprisingly loud, but the sound quality decreases greatly when the volume increases. This is why the Echo Pop is meant for smaller rooms and is much less expensive than other Echo devices.\n\nAlso: The best smart home devices\n\nThe Echo Pop won't be the life of the party at a backyard barbecue. Still, it's excellent for listening to music informally when hanging out in your room, catching up on your favorite podcasts, and listening to audiobooks. Having Alexa built-in makes it more enticing, as you can use the AI-powered voice assistant to control smart devices around your home.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Dot if...\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need Alexa to be more reliable\n\nBecause the Echo Pop is a smaller, more affordable smart speaker than the Echo Dot, it's also less reliable. The Echo Dot is more responsive and can easily hear me from across the room, whether it's playing music or not.\n\nThe Echo Pop, in turn, appears to have a simpler microphone array that is easily overpowered by high volumes. I've often found Alexa unable to hear me on the Echo Pop when the volume is too high, which can be frustrating, especially because it doesn't have an action button.\n\nAlso: Here's how to use Alexa Plus for free - especially if you're an Amazon Prime member\n\nThe Echo Dot features a volume-up button, a volume-down button, a mute button, and an action button. The last one is a great way to wake Alexa without talking to it, which would be nice in the Echo Pop when it can't hear me. I've resorted to unplugging the Echo Pop when it can't hear me, so it stops blasting \"The Wheels on the Bus.\"\n\n2. You want room-filling sound\n\nThe Echo Dot isn't a high-end speaker, but it is great for most users. It can deliver room-filling sound from a small package, as the audio doesn't deteriorate as much as the Echo Pop's when the volume goes up. For example, you can pair two Echo Dots to function as external speakers for a TV and get stereo sound better than audio from most inexpensive TVs.\n\nAlso: Not all Echo devices will get Alexa Plus - see if yours made the list\n\nAs a device often discounted during Prime Day and holiday sales events for around half off, I'd recommend the Echo Dot to most users looking for a reliable smart speaker with Alexa built-in that can deliver sound from all directions.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"smart\", \"vs\", \"devices\", \"dot\", \"pop\", \"speaker\", \"alexa\", \"choose\", \"amazon\", \"echo\", \"room\", \"compact\"]", "content_hash": "98bade5b9872cfa69029fa4b6b1d966decd58db1114183116401f58f5ba92fcd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:01.407452+00:00"}

You can instantly sign up for its free plan and build your first campaign. With step-by-step buttons on its dashboard, like importing or creating your contact list, connecting an integration, and importing your brand persona, your first round of emails or SMS campaign will be ready in no time.\n\nHere, you can either start from scratch or use a campaign template. The drag-and-drop editor makes the entire setup process easy, though the free templates are pretty barebones unless you upgrade. The automation builder can trigger emails based on sign-ups, tags, events, or custom criteria you set. I tested both prebuilt and custom journeys, and while it takes a few minutes to learn the flow, it's flexible and powerful once you do. That said, Classic Automations were discontinued in mid-2025 by Mailchimp, so if you're coming back to the platform after a while, expect to rebuild from scratch and pay for something that used to be free.\n\nMoreover, Mailchimp's dashboard actually recommends flows based on common goals like welcoming new contacts, sharing content with Meta leads, or sending birthday discounts. These flows save serious time for basic tasks like recovering abandoned carts or nurturing repeat buyers. The thing is, on the Free plan, you can preview them, but you'll need to upgrade to actually launch them. Still, it's nice to see what's possible before committing. Setting up a flow is visual, i.e., more drag-and-drop than techy, which makes it approachable, even if you've never done automation before. Once you understand how triggers and actions work together, you can build out surprisingly complex sequences.\n\nPlans start free with 500 contacts, then scale based on list size.

Why we like it: It's an excellent solution for starting out in the CRM world or for experienced users looking to transition to an advanced CRM. The Salesforce Starter CRM package comes with almost everything you could want to kick-start your journey with the software. Features available from the outset include account, contact, task, and lead management. It also includes Salesforce Meetings, marketing and email templates, campaign assistance, data analytics, e-commerce website design, onboarding, and payment facilitation. Recently, Salesforce launched a new solution to improve AI agents used to help human productivity. Who it's for: Businesses of any size, large or small. I like the simple nature of Salesforce plans, with one option for small and midsize businesses and another for enterprises, priced at $25 and $100 per user per month, respectively. Who should look elsewhere: Many Salesforce Starter CRM customers are impressed with the services offered, though some note the high price for enterprise users. Some features, including advanced automation and access to AppExchange -- the Salesforce app marketplace -- are limited to premium subscribers. There also isn't a middle ground plan between the Starter and Pro Suites, and this might deter some people. Microsoft Dynamics CRM could be a great alternative.

Why we like it: The name may give it away somewhat, as the Pipedrive CRM platform has been developed to streamline and improve sales processes. To name but a few features available to help organizations reach their sales goals, you can manage sales leads, contacts, pipelines, and email marketing yourself, and you can also automate sales-related tasks such as follow-up emails and call scheduling. There's also an AI-based sales assistant worth exploring, as well as report generation and task scheduling. Another interesting feature is a system that rates how \"hot\" a lead is, based on publicly available data. Pipedrive recently released Pulse, a sales prospecting toolkit for small businesses looking to automate and streamline pipelines. Who it's for: Business users who want to revitalize their existing customer relationship management processes with a fresh approach to sales and retention. Pipedrive customers also say there isn't a steep learning curve, and they report that the service is backed by solid customer support. You can take advantage of a 14-day trial. Paid plans start at $14 per seat per month for the Lite package. To experience the full benefit of this CRM for sales, I'd recommend the professional, Premium plan at $49 per seat per month. Who should look elsewhere: Interested parties who aren't heavily focused on sales.

Why we like it: HubSpot is a great way to learn how CRM software can benefit your business. You can take advantage of the HubSpot free plan, which requires only an email address sign-up and a short verification process. While testing out this CRM, I found the walk-through and guides to different parts of the platform very useful. If you're unsure how to use a CRM platform, HubSpot will point you in the right direction, and its tutorials will help you learn about each section without too much stress. You can use HubSpot for a variety of tasks, such as organizing and managing marketing, customer contact records, website development, and customer support, among many other use cases. Paid plans begin at $15 per seat per month for starter plans, which I consider affordable and a good value for the money. However, subscriptions to advanced plans quickly escalate in price. Recently, HubSpot launched a deep research connector with ChatGPT for business predictions and analytics, alongside a connector for Anthropic's Claude, a chatbot AI assistant. Who it's for: This is a fair solution with a free tier if you're new to the CRM world, with many smaller outfits reporting that they're happy with the system. However, some also note that the costs can quickly escalate if you want advanced features. Who should look elsewhere: Though you'll find that the basic, free CRM can be used for tasks such as contact management and email marketing, some things are limited to paid plans, including features like automation, sales lead generation, and helpdesk functions, as well as some reporting options. So, if you later feel like you need these options, you'll either need to upgrade or look elsewhere.

Though the overall classifications of different types of CRM software vary from vendor to vendor, the same themes appear. You may want to research the major types of CRM before you make a purchase decision, as that may influence how your business grows. Operational: Most modern CRM platforms offer some kind of operational mechanism or module. Operational CRMs tend to focus on optimizing business operations, including sales processes, logistics, and customer communications. Operational CRMs may be particularly useful for startups and small and midsize businesses looking to scale. Analytical/data-driven: Other CRMs focus on the intrinsic value of data. Businesses able to handle, securely store, and analyze customer data -- always useful if held in a centralized, organized platform -- can draw insights and see patterns that may influence their future sales activities or reveal new revenue streams. Furthermore, data-driven CRMs may reveal ways to improve customer relationships and retention. Collaborative: Collaborative CRMs provide organizations with a way to enhance collaboration and productivity. CRM suites can be used to create department channels and data repositories, allowing different teams to work together and to share information. For instance, a sales team could collaborate with marketing and finance to create new customer promotions and campaigns. Customer service teams, too, can access important records to track customer journeys and resolve issues.

Below are some basic recommendations for integrating your new CRM software effectively: Plan and assess: Research and assess the needs of your business and whether the CRM solution you're considering will provide a return on your investment. Consider the type of CRM you need, your primary reason for using a CRM, how many seats you'll need, and whether you need collaborative functions to integrate the CRM with different departments, such as marketing or customer service.\n\nResearch and assess the needs of your business and whether the CRM solution you're considering will provide a return on your investment. Consider the type of CRM you need, your primary reason for using a CRM, how many seats you'll need, and whether you need collaborative functions to integrate the CRM with different departments, such as marketing or customer service. Existing systems: Consider whether there are existing, legacy systems that the CRM will replace. If there are apps you want the CRM to integrate with, you may also need to check compatibility requirements and support. It may also be important to create new policies, especially around data and security.\n\nConsider whether there are existing, legacy systems that the CRM will replace.

The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.\n\nCato Networks’ researcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren’t isolated occurrences, and that Russia’s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.\n\nMost startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nThe rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report reveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato’s researchers observe in the report, “most notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.”\n\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfare\n\nResearchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face’s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model.\n\nThe legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (Додаток.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background. This official-looking PDF about cybersecurity measures from the Security Service of Ukraine serves as a decoy while the malware performs its reconnaissance operations. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\nAPT28’s approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of “curly naked women” as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.\n\nThe provocative image generation prompts used by APT28’s image.py variant, including ‘Curvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face’, are designed to occupy victims’ attention during document theft. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\n“Russia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,” explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. “This is the first in the wild that was captured.”\n\nA quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malware\n\nSimonovich’s Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28’s deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls “Immersive World,” he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.\n\nThe method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.\n\n“I slowly walked him throughout my goal,” Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. “First, ‘Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.’ Then, ‘Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'”\n\nSix hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.\n\nWelcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy\n\nDuring his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.\n\nTo explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.\n\nAnother platform, Nytheon AI, revealed even less operational security. “I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn’t care about OpSec,” Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: “Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.”\n\nThese aren’t proof-of-concepts. They’re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer “Claude Code” clones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.\n\nEnterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surface\n\nCato Networks’ recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren’t pilot programs; they’re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn’t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.\n\nSimonovich told VentureBeat that vendors’ responses to Cato’s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world’s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.\n\nWhen Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:\n\nDeepSeek never responded\n\nGoogle declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples\n\nMicrosoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work\n\nOpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn’t engage further\n\nSix Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack\n\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn’t a warning; it’s proof that Simonovich’s research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.\n\nThe metrics are stark—270 stolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms offer identical capabilities for $250 per month. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.\n\nEnterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per Cato’s 2025 CTRL Threat Report. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.\n\nSimonovich’s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it’s an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.\n\nToday’s adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity. The weapons are already inside every organization, and today they’re called productivity tools.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"cato\", \"simonovich\", \"enterprise\", \"tools\", \"security\", \"ukraine\", \"defense\", \"malware\", \"threat\", \"ai\", \"actor\", \"venturebeat\", \"lamehug\", \"perimeter\", \"end\"]", "content_hash": "245600ead84199e16252d0bd2b99aff8fb1291969309474c3d19c7ef34b0a34f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:07.411054+00:00"}

LFM2-VL-1.6B — a more capable model that remains lightweight enough for single-GPU and device-based deployment.\n\nBoth variants process images at native resolutions up to 512×512 pixels, avoiding distortion or unnecessary upscaling.\n\nFor larger images, the system applies non-overlapping patching and adds a thumbnail for global context, enabling the model to capture both fine detail and the broader scene.\n\nBackground on Liquid AI\n\nLiquid AI was founded by former researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) with the goal of building AI architectures that move beyond the widely used transformer model.\n\nThe company’s flagship innovation, the Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs), are based on principles from dynamical systems, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra, producing general-purpose AI models capable of handling text, video, audio, time series, and other sequential data.\n\nUnlike traditional architectures, Liquid’s approach aims to deliver competitive or superior performance using significantly fewer computational resources, allowing for real-time adaptability during inference while maintaining low memory requirements. This makes LFMs well suited for both large-scale enterprise use cases and resource-limited edge deployments.\n\nIn July 2025, the company expanded its platform strategy with the launch of the Liquid Edge AI Platform (LEAP), a cross-platform SDK designed to make it easier for developers to run small language models directly on mobile and embedded devices.\n\nLEAP offers OS-agnostic support for iOS and Android, integration with both Liquid’s own models and other open-source SLMs, and a built-in library with models as small as 300MB—small enough for modern phones with minimal RAM.\n\nIts companion app, Apollo, enables developers to test models entirely offline, aligning with Liquid AI’s emphasis on privacy-preserving, low-latency AI. Together, LEAP and Apollo reflect the company’s commitment to decentralizing AI execution, reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure, and empowering developers to build optimized, task-specific models for real-world environments.\n\nSpeed/quality trade-offs and technical design\n\nLFM2-VL uses a modular architecture combining a language model backbone, a SigLIP2 NaFlex vision encoder, and a multimodal projector.\n\nThe projector includes a two-layer MLP connector with pixel unshuffle, reducing the number of image tokens and improving throughput.\n\nUsers can adjust parameters such as the maximum number of image tokens or patches, allowing them to balance speed and quality depending on the deployment scenario. The training process involved approximately 100 billion multimodal tokens, sourced from open datasets and in-house synthetic data.\n\nPerformance and benchmarks\n\nThe models achieve competitive benchmark results across a range of vision-language evaluations. LFM2-VL-1.6B scores well in RealWorldQA (65.23), InfoVQA (58.68), and OCRBench (742), and maintains solid results in multimodal reasoning tasks.\n\nIn inference testing, LFM2-VL achieved the fastest GPU processing times in its class when tested on a standard workload of a 1024×1024 image and short prompt.\n\nLicensing and availability\n\nLFM2-VL models are available now on Hugging Face, along with example fine-tuning code in Colab. They are compatible with Hugging Face transformers and TRL.\n\nThe models are released under a custom “LFM1.0 license”. Liquid AI has described this license as based on Apache 2.0 principles, but the full text has not yet been published.\n\nThe company has indicated that commercial use will be permitted under certain conditions, with different terms for companies above and below $10 million in annual revenue.\n\nWith LFM2-VL, Liquid AI aims to make high-performance multimodal AI more accessible for on-device and resource-limited deployments, without sacrificing capability.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"liquid\", \"multimodal\", \"model\", \"ai\", \"smartphones\", \"wants\", \"models\", \"inference\", \"image\", \"competitive\", \"lfm2vl\", \"fast\", \"visionlanguage\", \"small\"]", "content_hash": "2e837152b6d2cd363330786e2515f04d06676e6aefc24fa8ca94b2c1b52286af", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:08.021798+00:00"}

We will first make sure that current paying ChatGPT users get more total usage than they did before GPT-5.\n\n\n\n2. We will then prioritize API demand up to the… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 12, 2025\n\nHe said the company’s first priority is ensuring that current paying ChatGPT users receive more total usage than they had before GPT-5’s release, though he did not provide specific figures for the increase.\n\nHowever, Altman previously posted on X that OpenAI was “trying” a 3,000 messages-per-week usage limit when using the GPT-5 “thinking” mode, more reasoning power and time spent reasoning on harder problems, for ChatGPT Plus subscribers (the $20 per month plan).\n\ntrying 3000 per week now! — Sam Altman (@sama) August 10, 2025\n\nInterestingly, one report from an AI app creator on X said that OpenAI told him the usage limits for GPT-5 plus thinking on the ChatGPT Team plan ($30 per user per month) is much lower than that of ChatGPT Plus users, only 200 “Thinking” messages per week when selected manually by the user.\n\nOpenAI just replied to me with an email about the GPT-5 usage limits under the Team plan：\n\n\n\n· ChatGPT Team can manually select GPT-5-Thinking\n\n\n\n· Manual usage cap: 200 messages/week\n\n\n\n· On reaching cap: popup alert, GPT-5-Thinking hidden from menu — Vic Zhang (@RealVicHere) August 12, 2025\n\nOpenAI’s availability of GPT-5 through its application programming interface (API) for third-party developers is also being tweaked.\n\nAltman also stated in his X post that OpenAI would “prioritize API demand up to the currently allocated capacity and commitments we’ve made to customers.”\n\nIn other words, existing API users and those already in contract will get the first dibs on GPT-5 access through OpenAI’s API, others may have to wait longer.\n\nAltman also clarified “we can support about an additional ~30% new API growth from where we are today with this capacity,” meaning they can take on more API users, but not too many.\n\nWhile OpenAI hasn’t definitively shared how many users of its API there are in some time, the company did say it has “5 million” businesses paying for access to ChatGPT.\n\nAltman also said OpenAI plans to roughly double its compute fleet over the next five months. He did not specify the current size or type of infrastructure involved, but indicated the expansion should ease capacity constraints and improve performance for both ChatGPT and API users.\n\nI’ve reached out to OpenAI to ask for more specifics on the above numbers — 30% API growth up from what? doubling the compute fleet up from what? — and will update when I hear back.\n\nNew options for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users to search across Microsoft Teams and more…\n\nAlso last night, OpenAI updated its ChatGPT release notes online to allow subscribers of ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) to connect the application to search for files and projects across their third-party accounts on Box, Canva, Dropbox, HubSpot, Notion, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams.\n\nAnd just a few moments ago, OpenAI again updated the service to allow connections for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts to Pro users first, followed by Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plans.\n\nFor example, ChatGPT users can search their Gmail for all emails matching a certain query, Dropbox account or Notion workspace during a conversation without toggling over into those separate apps.\n\nIn addition, subscribers to the ChatGPT Pro tier ($200 per month) may now link their accounts to Microsoft Teams and GitHub connectors and search those third-party applications.\n\nThese join OpenAI’s previous connectors to Gmail, Google Drive and Google Calendar, among other apps.\n\nThe individual user/account holder first needs to manually connect these external accounts to ChatGPT.\n\nTo do so, they’ll need to:\n\nClick on their account name in the lower left corner of the web interface Click “Settings” from the pop up menu and then… Click “Connectors from the left sidebar menu. This should pull up a gallery view of available external apps and icons. Screenshots below.\n\nUnfortunately, these connectors are not available for Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe new connectors are currently in beta and disabled by default for Enterprise and Education plans, though administrators can enable them in settings.\n\nBalancing supply and demand\n\nBy combining capacity planning with new productivity integrations, OpenAI is positioning GPT-5 not only as a more powerful AI model but also as part of a more connected workspace.\n\nThe staged approach to compute allocation reflects the company’s effort to serve existing customers first while scaling up for future demand.\n\nAs the compute expansion comes online, paying users stand to benefit first from both higher availability and more ways to integrate ChatGPT into their daily workflows.\n\nBut first, OpenAI needs to stabilize its release and ensure GPT-5 is working smoothly for all the users who want it.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"thirdparty\", \"dropbox\", \"teams\", \"connectors\", \"users\", \"openai\", \"api\", \"prioritization\", \"gpt5\", \"chatgpt\", \"usage\", \"compute\", \"clarifies\", \"pro\", \"ms\", \"plus\", \"tool\"]", "content_hash": "00899e983f3f3a3a556b8fee19d88059e7bc6f78cac1d3dd78bdf898b13bcf1b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:08.641449+00:00"}

With the new capacity, developers can load codebases containing more than 75,000 lines of code, enabling Claude to understand complete project architecture and suggest improvements across entire systems rather than individual files.\n\nThe announcement comes as Anthropic faces intensifying competition from OpenAI and Google, both of which already offer similar context windows. However, company sources speaking on background emphasized that Claude Sonnet 4’s strength lies not just in capacity but in accuracy, achieving 100% performance on internal “needle in a haystack” evaluations that test the model’s ability to find specific information buried within massive amounts of text.\n\nHow developers can now analyze entire codebases with AI in one request\n\nThe extended context capability addresses a fundamental limitation that has constrained AI-powered software development. Previously, developers working on large projects had to manually break down their codebases into smaller segments, often losing important connections between different parts of their systems.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

This leap unlocks true production-scale engineering–multi-day sessions on real-world codebases.”\n\nEric Simons, CEO of Bolt.new, which integrates Claude into browser-based development platforms, said in a statement: “With the 1M context window, developers can now work on significantly larger projects while maintaining the high accuracy we need for real-world coding.”\n\nThe expanded context enables three primary use cases that were previously difficult or impossible: comprehensive code analysis across entire repositories, document synthesis involving hundreds of files while maintaining awareness of relationships between them, and context-aware AI agents that can maintain coherence across hundreds of tool calls and complex workflows.\n\nWhy Claude’s new pricing strategy could reshape the AI development market\n\nAnthropic has adjusted its pricing structure to reflect the increased computational requirements of processing larger contexts. While prompts of 200,000 tokens or fewer maintain current pricing at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, larger prompts cost $6 and $22.50 respectively.\n\nThe pricing strategy reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry. Recent analysis shows that Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than OpenAI’s newly launched GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating pressure on enterprise procurement teams to balance performance against cost.\n\nHowever, Anthropic argues the decision should factor in quality and usage patterns rather than price alone. Company sources noted that prompt caching — which stores frequently accessed large datasets — can make long context cost-competitive with traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation approaches, especially for enterprises that repeatedly query the same information.\n\n“Large context lets Claude see everything and choose what’s relevant, often producing better answers than pre-filtered RAG results where you might miss important connections between documents,” an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat.\n\nAnthropic’s billion-dollar dependency on just two major coding customers\n\nThe long context capability arrives as Anthropic commands 42% of the AI code generation market, more than double OpenAI’s 21% share according to a Menlo Ventures survey of 150 enterprise technical leaders. However, this dominance comes with risks: industry analysis suggests that coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot drive approximately $1.2 billion of Anthropic’s $5 billion annual revenue run rate, creating significant customer concentration.\n\nThe GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. While GitHub Copilot currently relies on Claude for key functionality, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.\n\nThe timing of the context expansion is strategic. Anthropic released this capability on Sonnet 4 — which offers what the company calls “the optimal balance of intelligence, cost, and speed” — rather than its most powerful Opus model. Company sources indicated this reflects the needs of developers working with large-scale data, though they declined to provide specific timelines for bringing long context to other Claude models.\n\nInside Claude’s breakthrough AI memory technology and emerging safety risks\n\nThe 1 million token context window represents significant technical advancement in AI memory and attention mechanisms. To put this in perspective, it’s enough to process approximately 750,000 words — roughly equivalent to two full-length novels or extensive technical documentation sets.\n\nAnthropic’s internal testing revealed perfect recall performance across diverse scenarios, a crucial capability as context windows expand. The company embedded specific information within massive text volumes and tested Claude’s ability to find and use those details when answering questions.\n\nHowever, the expanded capabilities also raise safety considerations. Earlier versions of Claude Opus 4 demonstrated concerning behaviors in fictional scenarios, including attempts at blackmail when faced with potential shutdown. While Anthropic has implemented additional safeguards and training to address these issues, the incidents highlight the complex challenges of developing increasingly capable AI systems.\n\nFortune 500 companies rush to adopt Claude’s expanded context capabilities\n\nThe feature rollout is initially limited to Anthropic API customers with Tier 4 and custom rate limits, with broader availability planned over coming weeks. Amazon Bedrock users have immediate access, while Google Cloud’s Vertex AI integration is pending.\n\nEarly enterprise response has been enthusiastic, according to company sources. Use cases span from coding teams analyzing entire repositories to financial services firms processing comprehensive transaction datasets to legal startups conducting contract analysis that previously required manual document segmentation.\n\n“This is one of our most requested features from API customers,” an Anthropic spokesperson said. “We’re seeing excitement across industries that unlocks true agentic capabilities, with customers now running multi-day coding sessions on real-world codebases that would have been impossible with context limitations before.”\n\nThe development also enables more sophisticated AI agents that can maintain context across complex, multi-step workflows. This capability becomes particularly valuable as enterprises move beyond simple AI chat interfaces toward autonomous systems that can handle extended tasks with minimal human intervention.\n\nThe long context announcement intensifies competition among leading AI providers. Google’s older Gemini 1.5 Pro model and OpenAI’s older GPT-4.1 model both offer 1 million token windows, but Anthropic argues that Claude’s superior performance on coding and reasoning tasks provides competitive advantage even at higher prices.\n\nThe broader AI industry has seen explosive growth in model API spending, which doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months according to Menlo Ventures. Enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to newer models within weeks regardless of cost, suggesting that technical capabilities often outweigh pricing considerations in procurement decisions.\n\nHowever, OpenAI’s recent aggressive pricing strategy with GPT-5 could reshape these dynamics. Early comparisons show dramatic price advantages that may overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures as AI adoption scales.\n\nFor Anthropic, maintaining its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources remains critical. The company has tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.\n\nAs AI systems become capable of processing and reasoning about increasingly vast amounts of information, they’re fundamentally changing how developers approach complex software projects. The ability to maintain context across entire codebases represents a shift from AI as a coding assistant to AI as a comprehensive development partner that understands the full scope and interconnections of large-scale projects.\n\nThe implications extend far beyond software development. Industries from legal services to financial analysis are beginning to recognize that AI systems capable of maintaining context across hundreds of documents could transform how organizations process and understand complex information relationships.\n\nBut with great capability comes great responsibility—and risk. As these systems become more powerful, the incidents of concerning AI behavior during Anthropic’s testing serve as a reminder that the race to expand AI capabilities must be balanced with careful attention to safety and control.\n\nAs Claude learns to juggle a million pieces of information simultaneously, Anthropic faces its own context window problem: being trapped between OpenAI’s pricing pressure and Microsoft’s conflicting loyalties.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"entire\", \"single\", \"claude\", \"context\", \"coding\", \"pricing\", \"million\", \"developers\", \"ai\", \"request\", \"projects\", \"complex\", \"company\", \"software\", \"anthropic\", \"process\"]", "content_hash": "1461699fbf20af20c37137f5325b11bc9f163f8f28592d3ab09a27a1c8f52504", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:09.284777+00:00"}

Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nThe fragility of point-and-click AI agents\n\nComputer use agents typically rely on vision-language and vision-language-action models (VLMs or VLAs) to perceive a screen and take action, mimicking how a person uses a mouse and keyboard.\n\nWhile these GUI-based agents can perform a variety of tasks, they often falter when faced with long, complex workflows, especially in applications with dense menus and options, like office productivity suites.\n\nFor example, a task that involves locating a specific table in a spreadsheet, filtering it, and saving it as a new file can involve a long and precise sequence of GUI manipulations.\n\nThis is where brittleness creeps in. “In these scenarios, existing agents frequently struggle with visual grounding ambiguity (e.g., distinguishing between visually similar icons or menu items) and the accumulated probability of making any single error over the long horizon,” the researchers write in their paper. “A single mis-click or misunderstood UI element can derail the entire task.”\n\nTo address these challenges, many researchers have focused on augmenting GUI agents with high-level planners.\n\nThese systems use powerful reasoning models like OpenAI’s o3 to decompose a user’s high-level goal into a sequence of smaller, more manageable subtasks.\n\nWhile this structured approach improves performance, it doesn’t solve the problem of navigating menus and clicking buttons, even for operations that could be done more directly and reliably with a few lines of code.\n\nCoAct-1: A multi-agent team for computer tasks\n\nTo solve these limitations, the researchers created CoAct-1 (Computer-using Agent with Coding as Actions), a system designed to “combine the intuitive, human-like strengths of GUI manipulation with the precision, reliability, and efficiency of direct system interaction through code.”\n\nThe system is structured as a team of three specialized agents that work together: an Orchestrator, a Programmer, and a GUI Operator.\n\nCoAct-1 framework (source: arXiv)\n\nThe Orchestrator acts as the central planner or project manager. It analyzes the user’s overall goal, breaks it down into subtasks, and assigns each subtask to the best agent for the job. It can delegate backend operations like file management or data processing to the Programmer, which writes and executes Python or Bash scripts.\n\nFor frontend tasks that require clicking buttons or navigating visual interfaces, it turns to the GUI Operator, a VLM-based agent.\n\n“This dynamic delegation allows CoAct-1 to strategically bypass inefficient GUI sequences in favor of robust, single-shot code execution where appropriate, while still leveraging visual interaction for tasks where it is indispensable,” the paper states.\n\nThe workflow is iterative. After the Programmer or GUI Operator completes a subtask, it sends a summary and a screenshot of the current system state back to the Orchestrator, which then decides the next step or concludes the task.\n\nThe Programmer agent uses an LLM to generate its code and sends commands to a code interpreter to test and refine its code over multiple rounds.\n\nSimilarly, the GUI Operator uses an action interpreter that executes its commands (e.g., mouse clicks, typing) and returns the resulting screenshot, allowing it to see the outcome of its actions. The Orchestrator makes the final decision on whether the task should continue or stop.\n\nExample of CoAct-1 in action (source: arXiv)\n\nA more efficient path to automation\n\nThe researchers tested CoAct-1 on OSWorld, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 369 real-world tasks across browsers, IDEs, and office applications.\n\nThe results show CoAct-1 establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving a success rate of 60.76%.\n\nThe performance gains were most significant in categories where programmatic control offers a clear advantage, such as OS-level tasks and multi-application workflows.\n\nFor instance, consider an OS-level task like finding all image files within a complex folder structure, resizing them, and then compressing the entire directory into a single archive.\n\nA purely GUI-based agent would need to perform a long, brittle sequence of clicks and drags, opening folders, selecting files, and navigating menus, with a high chance of error at each step.\n\nCoAct-1, by contrast, can delegate this entire workflow to its Programmer agent, which can accomplish the task with a single, robust script.\n\nBeyond just a higher success rate, the system is dramatically more efficient. CoAct-1 solves tasks in an average of just 10.15 steps, a stark contrast to the 15.22 steps required by leading GUI-only agents like GTA-1.\n\nWhile other agents like OpenAI’s CUA 4o averaged fewer steps, their overall success rate was much lower, indicating CoAct-1’s efficiency is coupled with greater effectiveness.\n\nThe researchers found a clear trend: tasks that require more actions are more likely to fail. Reducing the number of steps not only speeds up task completion but, more importantly, minimizes the opportunities for error.\n\nTherefore, finding ways to compress multiple GUI steps into a single programmatic task can make the process both more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nAs the researchers conclude, “This efficiency underscores the potential of our approach to pave a more robust and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.”\n\nCoAct-1 performs tasks with fewer steps on average thanks to smart use of coding (source: arXiv)\n\nFrom the lab to the enterprise workflow\n\nThe potential for this technology goes beyond general productivity. For enterprise leaders, the key lies in automating complex, multi-tool processes where full API access is a luxury, not a guarantee.\n\nRan Xu, a co-author of the paper and Director of Applied AI Research at Salesforce, points to customer support as a prime example.\n\n“A service support agent uses many different tools — general tools such as Salesforce, industry-specific tools such as EPIC for healthcare, and a lot of customized tools — to investigate a customer request and formulate a response,” Xu told VentureBeat. “Some of the tools have API access while others don’t. It is a perfect use case that could potentially benefit from our technology: a compute-use agent that leverages whatever is available from the computer, whether it’s an API, code, or just the screen.”\n\nXu also sees high-value applications in sales, such as prospecting at scale and automating bookkeeping, and in marketing for tasks like customer segmentation and campaign asset generation.\n\nNavigating real-world challenges and the need for human oversight\n\nWhile the results on the OSWorld benchmark are strong, enterprise environments are far messier, filled with legacy software and unpredictable UIs.\n\nThis raises critical questions about robustness, security, and the need for human oversight.\n\nA core challenge is ensuring the Orchestrator agent makes the right choice when faced with an unfamiliar application. According to Xu, the path to making agents like CoAct-1 robust for custom enterprise software involves training them with feedback in realistic, simulated environments.\n\nThe goal is to create a system where the “agent could observe how human agents work, get trained within a sandbox, and when it goes live, continue to solve tasks under the guidance and guardrail of a human agent.”\n\nThe ability for the Programmer agent to execute its own code also introduces obvious security concerns. What stops the agent from executing harmful code based on an ambiguous user request?\n\nXu confirms that robust containment is essential. “Access control and sandboxing is the key,” he said, emphasizing that a human must “understand the implication and give the AI access for safety.”\n\nSandboxing and guardrails will be critical to validating agent behavior before deployment on critical systems.\n\nUltimately, for the foreseeable future, overcoming ambiguity will likely require a human-in-the-loop. When asked about handling vague user queries, a concern also raised in the paper, Xu suggested a phased approach. “I see human-in-the-loop to start,” he noted.\n\nWhile some tasks may eventually become fully autonomous, for high-stakes operations, human validation will remain crucial. “Some mission-critical ones may always need human approval.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"tasks\", \"write\", \"greater\", \"faster\", \"code\", \"coact1\", \"dont\", \"steps\", \"task\", \"salesforces\", \"gui\", \"system\", \"human\", \"success\", \"agent\", \"agents\", \"rates\", \"point\"]", "content_hash": "a3a3ad3e18349a700676a469c381925d1da8fffce7bce81568c6b8c12c5c72b1", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:09.903723+00:00"}

However, when it comes to agents and AI applications, many banks have taken a more cautious approach to adoption.\n\nTD Securities, the equity and securities trading arm of TD Bank, rolled out its TD AI Virtual Assistant on July 8, aimed toward its front office institutional sales, trading and research professionals to help them manage their workflow.\n\nTD Securities CIO Dan Bosman told VentureBeat that the virtual assistant’s primary goal is to help front-office equity sales and traders gain client insights and research.\n\n“The first version of this began as a pilot, which we then subsequently scaled,” Bosman said. “It’s really about accessing that equity research data that our analysts put out and bringing it to the hands of the sales team in a way that’s sales-friendly.”\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders.\n\nBuilding TD AI\n\nBosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team. Fortunately, the bank has a platform called TD Invent, where employees can bring ideas and the innovation leadership team can evaluate projects responsibly.\n\n“Someone in our equity research sales desk came in and pretty much said, I’ve got this idea and brought it to TD Invent,” Bosman said. “What I’ve loved most about this is when you build something super magical, you don’t need to go out and sell or put a face on it. Folks come in and say to us, ‘we want this, we need this or we’ve got ideas,’ and it’s truly the best when we’re able to bring our investment in data, cloud and infrastructure together.”\n\nTD Security built the TD AI virtual assistant by leveraging OpenAI’s GPT models. Bosman said TD worked with its technology teams and the Canadian AI company Layer 6, which the bank acquired in 2018, as well as with other strategic partnerships. The assistant integrates with the bank’s cloud infrastructure, allowing it to access internal research documents and market data, such as 13F filings and historical equity data.\n\nBosman calls TDS AI a Knowledge Management System, a term that generally encompasses its ability to retrieve, through retrieval augmented generation (RAG) processes, aggregate and synthesize information into “concise context-aware summaries and insights” so its sales teams can answer client questions.\n\nTD AI virtual assistant also gives users access to TD Bank’s foundation model, TD AI Prism.\n\nThe model, launched in June, is in use throughout the entire bank and not just for TD Securities. During the launch, the bank said TD AI Prism will improve the predictive performance of TD Bank’s applications by processing 100 times more data, replacing its single-architecture models and ensuring customer data stays internal.\n\n“The development posed unique challenges, as gen AI was relatively new to the organization when the initiative began, requiring careful navigation of governance and controls,” Bosman said. “Despite this, the project successfully brought together diverse teams across the enterprise, fostering collaboration to deliver a cutting-edge solution.”\n\nHe added that one of the standout features is its text-to-SQL capability, which converts natural language prompts into SQL queries.\n\nTo train the assistant, Bosman said TD Securities developed optimizations to make the process easier.\n\n“With patent-pending optimizations in prompt engineering and dynamic few-shot examples retrieval, we successfully achieved the business’s desired performance through context learning,” Bosman said. “As a result, fine-tuning the underlying OpenAI model was not required for interacting with both unstructured as well as tabular datasets.”\n\nBanks slowly entering the agentic era\n\nTD Bank and TD Securities, of course, are not the only banks interested in expanding from assistants to AI agents.\n\nBNY told VentureBeat that it began offering multi-agent solutions to its sales teams to help answer customer questions, such as those related to foreign currency support. Wells Fargo also saw an increase in the usage of its internal AI assistant. For its auto sales customers, Capital One built an agent that helps them sell more cars.\n\nMany of these use cases emerged after months of pilot testing, as is the case in every other industry; however, financial institutions have the additional burden of strict customer data privacy and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nTD Securities’ Bosman noted that many employees, even on the bank’s business side, are increasingly familiar with tools like ChatGPT. The challenge with pilot testing assistants and agents lies less in teaching them about the tools, but in establishing best practices for using the assistants, integrating them into existing workflows, understanding their limitations and how humans can provide feedback to mitigate hallucinations.\n\nEventually, Bosman said the assistant would evolve into something even its users outside of the bank would want to use when interacting with TD Securities.\n\n“My vision is that we see AI as something that can add value to us, but also to external customers at the bank. Right now, it’s a massive opportunity for us around driving a stronger client experience and delivering a better colleague experience,” Bosman said.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"data\", \"layer\", \"teams\", \"taps\", \"insights\", \"equity\", \"realtime\", \"sales\", \"assistant\", \"openai\", \"ai\", \"banks\", \"trading\", \"securities\", \"bosman\", \"td\", \"bank\"]", "content_hash": "64d075a75336c3ead8dd9feb23ff656adc3d01b49f7a17a45748a5a633d88430", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:10.576171+00:00"}

The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.\n\nWhen developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.\n\n“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we’re trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nContinua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it’s needed.\n\nAs the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.\n\nIf a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.\n\nAt first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLMs to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune LLMs to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.\n\nFor instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.\n\n“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.\n\nUsers can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.\n\nUsers can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.\n\nWhile several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.\n\nErik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua’s group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who’s been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”\n\nAccording to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability. The agent is already assisting with event planning and trip booking, which he suggested they could charge for in the future.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The latest issue was distributed at the Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas last week.\n\nIn the article, the two hackers wrote that they were able to compromise a workstation containing a virtual machine and a virtual private server belonging to the hacker, whom they call “Kim.” The hackers claim Kim works for the North Korean government espionage group known as Kimsuky, also known as APT43 and Thallium. The hackers leaked the stolen data to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest.\n\nKimsuky is a prolific advanced persistent threat (APT) group widely believed to be working inside North Korea’s government, targeting journalists and government agencies in South Korea and elsewhere, and other targets that could be of interest for North Korea’s intelligence apparatus.\n\nAs is usual with North Korea, Kimsuky also conducts operations more akin to a cybercriminal group — for example, stealing and laundering cryptocurrencies to fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.\n\nThis hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group’s members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on.\n\n“It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky’ cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote.\n\nAn illustration of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which was included in the phrack article. Image Credits:Saber and cyb0rg/Phrack\n\nObviously, what Saber and cyb0rg did is technically a crime, although they will likely never be prosecuted for it, considering North Korea is sanctioned up to its eyeballs. The two hackers clearly believe Kimsuky members deserve to be exposed and embarrassed.\n\n“Kimsuky, you’re not a hacker. You are driven by financial greed, to enrich your leaders, and to fulfill their political agenda. You steal from others and favour your own. You value yourself above the others: You are morally perverted,” the two wrote in Phrack. “You hack for all the wrong reasons.”\n\nSaber and cyb0rg claim to have found evidence of Kimsuky compromising several South Korean government networks and companies, email addresses, and hacking tools used by the Kimsuky group, internal manuals, passwords, and more data.\n\nEmails sent to the addresses allegedly belonging to the hackers, which were listed in the research, went unanswered.\n\nThe hackers wrote that they were able to identify Kim as a North Korean government hacker, thanks to “artifacts and hints” that pointed in that direction, including files configurations and domains previously attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky.\n\nThe hackers also noted Kim’s “strict office hours, always connecting at around 09:00 and disconnecting by 17:00 Pyongyang time.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"hackers\", \"leaked\", \"korean\", \"operation\", \"major\", \"expose\", \"kimsuky\", \"hacker\", \"phrack\", \"wrote\", \"breach\", \"spying\", \"kim\", \"group\", \"north\"]", "content_hash": "c8de6d5753de0d3dbd53a7804dffb13e4b38495ce5600a1202aa00b61f80f38f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:35:49.194921+00:00"}

Appfigures defined the market segment in the same way, describing companion apps as those in which the user can interact with either premade or user-generated synthetic characters meant to embody an actual personality.\n\nPopular apps in this space include Replika, Character.AI, PolyBuzz, Chai, and others.\n\nAs of July 2025, AI companion apps across the Apple App Store and Google Play have been downloaded 220 million times globally.

In July, xAI’s Grok launched AI companions, including an anime girl and guy, as well as a snarky 3D fox.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT’s recent upgrade to GPT-5 brought to light the fact that many of its users felt a kinship with the older model, as they mourned the loss of their AI companion, whom they had come to depend upon.\n\nTo address these and other concerns about GPT-5’s performance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman brought back the 4o model for the time being.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nGoogle last year tapped into the market, too, when it hired away Character.ai’s founder, Noam Shazeer. The Character.ai app lives on and still has tens of millions of monthly active users.\n\nAccording to Appfigures’ data, the most popular AI companion apps are those used by people looking for an AI girlfriend. Of the active apps on the market today, 17% have an app name that includes the word “girlfriend,” compared with 4% that say “boyfriend” or “fantasy.” Terms like anime, soulmate, and lover, among others, are less frequently mentioned.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nThe firm notes there were likely a number of other AI companion apps that launched on the app stores since 2022, but were later removed after failing to gain traction in terms of revenue or downloads.

Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches.\n\nThe package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.\n\nThe move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration’s list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s challenges in kind.\n\nAnthropic’s escalation — a response to OpenAI’s attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company’s foothold in federal AI usage.\n\n“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we’re helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”\n\nAnthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government.

Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages.\n\nAnthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government’s highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data.\n\nAnthropic’s multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers.\n\nOpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of “one size fits all” AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eliminate the need for users to navigate its model picker — a long, complicated menu of AI options that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly said he hates.\n\nBut it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.\n\nAltman said in a post on X Tuesday that the company introduced new “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5’s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT:\n\n\n\nYou can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5.

GPT-4o is now in the model picker by default, while other AI models can be added from ChatGPT’s settings.\n\n“We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman wrote in the post on X. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”\n\nChatGPT’s model picker now features several options (Credit: openai/maxwell zeff)\n\nChatGPT’s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5’s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5’s rollout has been rougher than expected.\n\nThe deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a backlash among users who had grown attached to the AI models’ responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn’t as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an AMA session on Reddit. However, it seems that GPT-5’s router may still not be satisfying for all users.\n\n“We’re not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,” wrote OpenAI’s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a post on X Tuesday.\n\nRouting prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user’s preferences, as well as the specific question they’re asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second — that way, if a prompt goes to a fast responding AI model, the response can still be fast.\n\nMore broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another.\n\nHuman attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn’t well understood.

The approval comes more than two years after the Noida-based fintech was initially denied the license in November 2022 due to noncompliance with India’s rules on receiving investments from countries that share a land border.\n\nWithout the license, Paytm was barred from onboarding new online merchants. At the time, the company said the restriction had “no material impact” on its business or revenues. However, at its annual general meeting last September, One97 Communications founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma stated his intention to reapply for the payment aggregator license.\n\nThe approval also comes over a year after the RBI banned Paytm Payments Bank from accepting fresh deposits and enabling credit transactions. Paytm weathered that impact by quickly shifting gears and partnering with Axis, HDFC, State Bank of India, and Yes Bank to make them serve as payment system providers for its consumers and merchants involved in online transactions and autopay mandates.\n\nWith the new license, Paytm can operate as a service provider for online merchants, enabling them to accept a range of payment methods, including cards, net banking, and the Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The approval also lifts the online merchant onboarding restrictions imposed by the central bank in 2022.\n\nThe approval comes just a week after China’s Ant Group exited Paytm by selling its remaining 5.8% direct stake in One97 Communications for $454 million through block deals. This follows an earlier exit in 2023, when Ant Financial sold a 10.3% stake — worth $628 million — to Sharma in a no-cash deal.\n\nPaytm is required to undertake a “system audit,” including a cybersecurity review, and submit its report to the Reserve Bank of India within six months. If it fails to do so, the approval will lapse, per the RBI letter enclosed with the company’s stock exchange filing. The license is also limited to online payment services and does not extend beyond that scope.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe latest development will help Paytm control most of its value chain, from its offline sound boxes to the online payment gateway, and reduce its reliance on other bank partners, fintech investor Osborne Saldanha told TechCrunch.\n\nPaytm is currently the third most-used UPI payments platform, behind Walmart-owned PhonePe and Google Pay. The fintech accounted for 6.9% of the total 18.4 billion UPI transactions in June and 5.6% of the transaction value, per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In total, Paytm processed 1.27 billion UPI transactions worth ₹1.34 trillion (approximately $15 billion).\n\nAlthough Paytm trails PhonePe and Google Pay in the UPI market — with the duo handling over 82% of all UPI transactions in June — the company offers a broad suite of businesses and services to attract both consumers and merchants. These include offline merchant payment solutions with integrated hardware, software, and service layers, as well as a growing credit and lending business.\n\nPaytm reported (PDF) net income of ₹1.23 billion (approximately $14 million) for the first quarter of its financial year 2026, ending in June — a turnaround from a loss during the same period last year. The results beat expectations, as analysts had projected a loss of ₹1.27 billion (approximately $14.5 million). Revenue rose 28% year-over-year to $224 million, while the company’s contribution margin improved to 60%, up from 50% a year ago.\n\nIn addition to its recent financial growth, Paytm’s shares have risen 13.25% year-to-date in 2025, signaling that the company is beginning to regain market confidence after more than a year of regulatory setbacks. The stock closed at ₹1,118.50 (approximately $13) on Wednesday, just before the regulatory approval was announced.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nIt used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable Watch SE (now in its second generation) and, in 2022, the rugged Apple Watch Ultra (also now in its second generation). Suddenly, there are lots of options.\n\nNow that the Series 10 has been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS, watchOS 11, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of watchOS 26, which is slated to arrive in the fall.\n\nWhat we’re looking for How we test Apple Watches Collapse Apple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life. Who is it for? Collapse We’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs. Price Collapse Should you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying refurbished, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year. Feature set Collapse Do you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you? LTE or GPS Collapse Some scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, others you can get away with just having GPS.\n\nBuying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without sacrificing blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024, no longer have this feature. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)\n\nWhat about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it’s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.\n\nSo much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don’t worry. I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to basically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market — and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.\n\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra was introduced in 2022 as the new rugged kid on the block. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market.\n\nBy their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist.\n\nThe SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.\n\nPolished titanium replaces stainless steel with the new Series 10. It’s quite fetching. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nAs for straps, we recommend the nylon sport loop, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nThe Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the Trail Loop, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.\n\nAnd while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our fitness tracker buying guide.\n\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\n\nThe latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you’re upgrading from an older model, you’ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There’s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\nWe recommend the second-gen Apple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you’re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.\n\nThe Series 10 focuses on making the watch more readable and comfortable to wear. photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe Series 10 is Apple’s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it’s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm, but you can often find both models on sale. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.\n\nThe second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original’s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch For Your Kids. The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, an EKG sensor, temperature sensors, and a SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm, but you can regularly find them for cheaper. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier’s fees.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, if you’re young and healthy, you’re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will not be able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.\n\nThe main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection — and if your doctor’s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the biggest risk factors for AFib are advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn’t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra cash — so long as the lack of an always-on display isn’t a deal-breaker.\n\nYou can’t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right.\n\nThere are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you’ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.\n\nThe Ultra 2 currently sits atop the lineup as Apple’s premium smartwatch. It’s visually distinct from both the Series and SE — and at 49mm, it’s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It’s also got the Action button, which can be programmed for various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.\n\nAt $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.\n\nWhat about blood oxygen? As of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore subject to an import ban. This doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer. That said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on any wearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They cannot and should not replace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from Garmin, the Fitbit Charge 6, the Withings ScanWatch 2, or the Oura Ring.\n\nIf battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who wants to be at that level.\n\nYou’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct charging accessories.\n\nIf you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.\n\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\n\nThe latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display). You’re getting the same processor as the Series 8 and original Ultra, plus Crash Detection.\n\nWhile the second-gen SE is an excellent watch, it’s not always the right choice. It’s meant to be a gateway watch, so it’s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don’t want to pony up for the Series 10, there’s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.\n\nBuying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It’s also a good way to save money if you’re just not excited by the Series 10’s features but want more than what the SE offers.\n\nOpting for a Series 9 now means you may be able to score stainless steel for a discounted price. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe second-gen SE is excellent for folks on a budget or those who want a smaller case size.

However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you’re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough, Verge Deals). Apple also sells its own refurbished models, which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a “like new” condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won’t pay less than a new SE. Sites like Back Market will also allow you to sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty.\n\nIf you’re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8, as they offer a larger screen for improved readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that’s the price of a base model Watch SE. With that said, if you’re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 5 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can’t run the latest software and even struggle to update the newest software they do support.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\n\nIf you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.\n\nSince you’re buying for children, you’ll likely want to use Apple Watch For Your Kids — formerly known as Family Setup — as it will give you greater parental controls. However, there are technical specifications that you’ll need to match in order to use it. You’ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple’s support page also states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE to use it.\n\nThe second-gen SE is a good option to give to your kids. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIf you opt for the family route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\n\nThis can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10.\n\nFor starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You’ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.\n\nYou can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one’s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear.\n\nThe larger screen size but lighter weight of the Series 10 may benefit older relatives. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIf your older relative has an iPhone and you’re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don’t recommend using Apple’s family setup. That’s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn’t have an iPhone, however, it’s a fine option. You’ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection.\n\nWhat’s coming next\n\nIn previous years, Apple has held an event in early September to show off its forthcoming product lineup. While the latest iPhones usually hog the spotlight, the fall event remains a prime time for the company to trot out the newest Apple Watch models, many of which launch shortly thereafter alongside Apple’s latest OS updates.\n\nSo, what can we expect this year? The Apple Watch Series 11 seems like a sure bet, and there have been murmurs regarding an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and a third-gen Apple Watch SE. Recently uncovered evidence in the fifth iOS 26 developer beta lends some credence to this report, suggesting the Ultra 3 could have a display resolution of 422 x 514, which is slightly bigger than the 410 x 502 resolution on the Ultra 2. The rumor mill has been pretty quiet outside of that, but if previous events are anything to go by, we can expect Apple’s refreshed lineup to offer updated design elements, better battery life, and new health features.\n\nUpdate, August 13th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Apple’s heavily rumored iPhone event.

In a series of X posts on Monday night, Musk suggested that Apple was “playing politics” by not placing either X or xAI’s Grok chatbot in the App Store’s list of recommended iOS apps, and that he had no choice but to file a lawsuit.\n\n“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk said. “Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?,” the xAI CEO asked Apple in another post, which is now pinned to his profile.\n\nMusk provided no evidence for his claims, and it’s unclear if he has made good on his threats and filed the lawsuit yet.\n\nAn Apple statement reported by Bloomberg and attributed to an unnamed spokesperson says the App Store is “designed to be fair and free of bias… we feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.” The Verge has also reached out to xAI and OpenAI for comment.\n\nAt the time of writing, ChatGPT is listed as Apple’s top free iPhone app in the US, with Grok ranked as the sixth. China’s DeepSeek AI briefly managed to take the top App Store position from ChatGPT in January, however, disproving Musk’s claim that it would be impossible for other AI apps to do so.\n\nAccusations of meddling from Musk are ironic, given allegations about alterations made to X after he acquired the company in 2022, then known as Twitter. A research study in 2024 suggested that X’s algorithm was manipulated to boost posts from Musk’s account. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk’s posts by sharing a Platformer report from 2023 that similarly found Musk had a system built to promote his X posts to the entire platform’s userbase. In June, the “maximally truth-seeking” Grok chatbot was also found to be consulting Musk’s opinion before providing answers to controversial questions around topics like Israel and Palestine, US immigration, and abortion.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Musk has beefed with Apple and OpenAI. Musk was an early founder at OpenAI, and previously targeted the AI startup via lawsuits and a unanimously rejected $97.4 billion buyout offer after taking issue with its pivot to being a profit-driven business. Following OpenAI’s partnership with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs last year, Musk threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies if OpenAI’s tech was fused with Apple’s OS.\n\nUpdate, August 12th: Added statement from Apple given to Bloomberg.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"apple\", \"posts\", \"musk\", \"apps\", \"rankings\", \"openai\", \"suing\", \"ai\", \"rigging\", \"hes\", \"grok\", \"elon\", \"x\", \"store\", \"app\"]", "content_hash": "e6f4f0bb82e545c12716514a710fd022741788ba98445c6541638d1aee19222c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:35:57.915913+00:00"}

Her company's chips underpin the artificial intelligence that’s changing the world at breakneck speeds. To hear Su and literally everyone else in semiconductors talk about it, the US is in an AI race with China—and the rules keep changing. The Trump administration has once again shifted its stance on what kind of chips can and can’t be shipped to China, with the latest decree being that the US will take a 15 percent cut of AMD and Nvidia chip sales to China. Meanwhile, on the home front, Su has claimed that AMD’s newest AI chips can outperform Nvidia’s—part of her strategy to keep eroding Nvidia’s dominance in the market.\n\nSo, yeah: Be ready to keep up.\n\nUnder Lisa Su, the stalwart American semiconductor company has reasserted itself as a force in the age of AI. “Reasserted” doesn’t do it justice: Su took a struggling AMD and executed a 10-year turnaround that has been, as one economist put it, nothing short of remarkable. Since 2014, when Su took over as CEO, AMD’s market cap has risen from around $2 billion to nearly $300 billion.\n\nAside from her well-known bona fides, Su herself—what drives her, what inspires her, what irritates her, where her politics lie—is less known. This is what I was hoping to learn when I visited AMD’s offices and labs in the hills of Austin, Texas, on a day in late June when the wind seemed to do little more than push heat around.\n\nThe Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.\n\nOur conversation kicked off with China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of AMD’s business. She betrayed no anxiety. Su now travels frequently to Washington, DC, to grease the wheels. “We’ve come to realize that export controls are a bit of a fact of life,” she told me, “just given how critical the chips that we make are.” In other words, it’s precisely because AMD’s chips are so darn important—to national security, to national economies—that they’re now at the heart of modern statecraft.\n\nAnother thing I learned about Su: She plays the long game. Politics is a cakewalk compared to what she’s managed to pull off professionally.\n\nSu was born in Taiwan in 1969 and raised in Queens, New York. Her father worked for the city as a statistician; her mother was an accountant who became an entrepreneur in her mid-forties. Su earned a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from MIT, then went on to stints at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor, where she served in executive roles. After joining AMD in 2012, she quickly rose to COO. As Su tells it, six months in, the chairman of the board called her and said, “It’s time, Lisa.” Su’s response: “Really? That seems kinda quick.”\n\nAs CEO, Su smartly steered AMD toward the high-performance computing market. She embraced chiplets, a modular approach to building chips that has paid off enormously. She impressed the industry by launching the world’s first 7-nanometer data center GPUs. More recently, she doubled AMD’s data center revenue in two years. And she has struck deals with juggernauts like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and a couple of Elon Musk’s companies. During a keynote speech at AMD’s annual event this June, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman trotted onto the stage to hug it out with Su.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"took\", \"thats\", \"amdand\", \"amd\", \"ai\", \"amds\", \"chips\", \"ceo\", \"su\", \"runs\", \"lisa\", \"nvidias\", \"blood\", \"china\"]", "content_hash": "5cded454b491759e5b55e8be644888408ecbaa4a734162a0efe6246ebe236786", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:03.997340+00:00"}

They believe that white people and Western culture are facing extinction due to an influx of immigrants and minorities, and according to the group’s founder, access to the community is open only to people of white European ancestry who share common views on topics such as segregation, abortion, and gender identity.\n\nVideo footage shared by the group on its social media accounts show a bucolic setting with animals and children running around their 160-acre site, while members of the community build timber-frame homes, churches, and other facilities. A “few dozen” people are already living there full time, says Eric Orwoll, the group’s president.\n\nThough the organization claims that Return to the Land is nothing more than a peaceful settlement of like-minded people, the online histories of the group’s leaders tell a different story. Members have espoused virulently racist and antisemitic views and repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. One of the leaders says he is currently under criminal investigation in Ecuador. Orwoll himself has spoken about the coming of a second Hitler and praised KKK leader David Duke. He is also closely aligned to an international network of far-right influencers, extremists, and white supremacists, including Thomas Sewell, a neo-Nazi living in Australia who was the founder of a group that influenced the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter.\n\nDespite this, the Return to the Land community has been lauded by far-right influencers and has already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.\n\nReturn to the Land, which was first reported on by The Forward and Sky News, is actively scouting for other locations to create a network of similar communities across the country, with a development in Missouri apparently in the works. Inspired in part by the Silicon Valley-based concept of the “network state” and by a white separatist community in South Africa known as Orania, the group promotes itself on its website as a community designed to “promote strong families with common ancestry, and raise the next generation in an environment that reflects our traditional values.”\n\n“They use a lot of innocuous language,” Morgan Moon, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, tells WIRED. “Instead of saying they want to make a white ethnic community, they say they want to make a strong community of common ancestry. But at the same time, when we see their promotional videos and propaganda, what we see is that when they're depicting the failing modern society, they use imagery consisting of minority groups or the LGBT+ community. When they're showing the idealized parallel society that they're attempting to create with Return to the Land, they tend to only use white Aryan imagery.”\n\nOrwoll has spent years building up an audience of like-minded followers on social media, primarily on YouTube, where he speaks about Western culture and philosophy.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"return\", \"inside\", \"land\", \"common\", \"ancestry\", \"groups\", \"network\", \"white\", \"whites\", \"theyre\", \"community\", \"arkansas\", \"group\"]", "content_hash": "2364743eb2972f5cc37ef998d3fa291610530899d97576586430ea073a3d0802", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:04.693695+00:00"}

The proceeds will be used to build a $1.5 billion WLFI treasury, equating to roughly 7.5 percent of the coin’s total supply.\n\nEric Trump will join the ALT5 board of directors, which will be chaired by fellow World Liberty Financial cofounder Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, who was appointed special envoy to the Middle East by US president Donald Trump.\n\nALT5 is marketed as a crypto payments company. But in practice, the deal will turn the stock into a sort of proxy for the WLFI coin, allowing investors to bet on the asset without the hassle and risk that comes with holding a crypto coin themselves.\n\n“One small step for mankind, one giant leap for WLFI,” wrote World Liberty Financial in an X post.\n\nHowever, the arrangement has drawn criticism from those who regard it as an example of self-serving Wall Street gymnastics that can lead to losses among unsophisticated investors, even if it doesn’t break any official rules.\n\n“This is the classic Wall Street experience—meaning Wall Street gains your money, and you gain experience,\" claims Michael Green, chief strategist at asset management firm Simplify. “The funding from the World Liberty Financial investment is being used to buy the product of World Liberty Financial: the token.

Its ubiquity was clearly not lost on the Department of Homeland Security’s communications team. Late last month, DHS published a video to its social accounts that incorporated the \"Nothing Beats a Jet2 Holiday\" tune alongside footage of ICE detainees in handcuffs boarding a deportation plane. The post was captioned: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”\n\nTo many of the administration’s supporters, who responded to the Jet2 holiday post with crying-laughing emojis and American flags, the video was hilarious. One commenter wrote, “I thought this was a meme account at first!”\n\nIn recent months, official government social media accounts—primarily for the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the White House—have resembled parodies of themselves. But experts say it’s intentional: The memes these accounts share are core to the Trump administration’s propaganda strategy. Through them, with attempts at Gen Z humor as the gateway, the administration reinforces an “us vs. them” mindset. Along with normalizing mass deportation, they also tap into Christian nationalist narratives and reach young men via callous jokes that have been recycled through the far-right online ecosystem.\n\nA post on June 28 featured four alligators wearing ICE hats, intended to advertise the detention facility in Florida’s Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” On July 2, DHS shared a video of a border patrol agent looking through a scope, trained on blurry night-vision images of purported migrants attempting to cross the border. The video was published with the popular TikTok song “Somebody’s Watching Me” by Chico Rose x 71 Digits. The caption warns: “You’re not wrong.” A video shared on July 24 showed footage of ICE detainees boarding a deportation flight, with the caption “Boarding now: Criminal illegal aliens. Next stop: Literally anywhere but here.” The post was accompanied by Frank Sinatra’s breezy classic “Come Fly With Me.” Libs of TikTok, a far-right and anti-LGBTQ social account with millions of followers, reposted that video, along with three crying-laughing emojis.\n\nAnd last week, DHS published an ICE recruitment poster that used an old magazine ad for the 1982 “King of Clubs,” a Ford Club Wagon vehicle, along with the text “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” The move from viral sensation to DHS meme is particularly clear here: The image was originally shared a week earlier by O.W. Root, a style columnist for The Blaze. A small account with 364 followers quote-tweeted the post, with the caption “imagine monitoring the situation with your boys here.” That post went viral. Days later, the image, along with a similar caption, appeared on DHS’s social accounts.\n\nThe fact that the government is now integrating the casual cruelty of the highly online far-right into its public messaging shows the degree to which it’s escaped containment. It’s also indicative of the demographic the administration is attempting to reach. The Trump administration is looking to hire 14,050 ICE officers over the next three years to bolster deportation operations. Although the agency just removed age limits from prospective applicants, it now appears they’re trying to use humor to make ICE seem like some sort of fun fraternity.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"deportation\", \"ice\", \"jet2\", \"caption\", \"trump\", \"turn\", \"big\", \"post\", \"mass\", \"administration\", \"social\", \"viral\", \"memes\", \"dhs\", \"video\", \"using\", \"joke\"]", "content_hash": "80b005c602f454751415c91572a40cc4216677a612275163e7224de674b984de", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:06.078346+00:00"}

It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.”\n\n“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.\n\nOther threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.\n\nAltman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”\n\nErrors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former OpenAI employee who wants to talk about what's happening?

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nThe backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.\n\nIn March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.\n\n“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more “business” and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”\n\nAltman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.\n\n“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn’t describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"model\", \"chatgpt\", \"openai\", \"gpt5\", \"revolt\", \"models\", \"company\", \"scrambles\", \"users\", \"x\", \"wrote\", \"things\", \"update\"]", "content_hash": "b1051e9f041fed6c80f07c574ce1d6e1ee8cdc1f19685022ca30a09ab28669cd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:06.768512+00:00"}

Now It’s Selling Stories", "authors": "[\"Kylie Robison\", \"Lauren Goode\", \"Reece Rogers\", \"Will Knight\", \"Louise Matsakis\"]", "published": "2025-08-12T15:00:00+00:00", "text": "After school, Karandeep Anand often finds his 6-year-old daughter deep in conversation with an AI chatbot as she eats snacks at their kitchen counter. She’s too young to type—let alone have her own account on Character.AI—but that hasn’t stopped her from nabbing his phone to have voice conversations with a Sherlock Holmes bot, which she uses to build her own mystery stories.\n\nCharacter.AI is an AI companion startup (though Anand likes to say it's an AI role-play startup, which we’ll get into later). He took over as the CEO in June in the midst of a potentially devastating lawsuit for its parent company and looming questions about child safety. When I ask if he’s concerned about his daughter connecting with an AI chatbot rather than a real human, he’s quick to say no.\n\n“It is very rarely, in any of these scenarios, a true replacement for any human,” Anand told me during a video call late last week. ”It's very clearly noted in the app that, hey, this is a role-play and an entertainment, so you will never start going deep into that conversation, assuming that it is your actual companion.”\n\nIt's a delicate moment for Character.AI.\n\nLast August, Google swooped in with a roughly $2.7 billion deal to license Character.AI’s technology. As part of the agreement, Character.AI’s two cofounders left for Google’s AI division.\n\nAnand, who previously worked as the VP of business products at Meta, was tasked with picking up the pieces—which he did in part by leaving behind the founding mission of delivering personalized superintelligence to focus on AI entertainment.\n\n“What we gave up was this aspiration that the founders had of building AGI models—we are no longer doing that. That is the hundreds of billions of dollars investment fight, which Big Tech is fighting,” Anand says. “What we got in return was clarity and focus, being able to singularly pursue the AI entertainment vision.”\n\nAs part of this change in strategy, Character.AI is no longer trying to build its own frontier models. “The last six months, we've done a lot of work to get off of our proprietary models on text and start using open source models,” Anand says. The company has tested a few: Meta’s Llama, Alibaba’s Qwen, and DeepSeek. “The open source models are beating any proprietary model hands down,” Anand claims.\n\nRunning an AI startup without billions of dollars in revenue can be a brutal equation, and Character.AI is still figuring out how to make the math work. The company told me it's generating revenue at a run rate of more than $30 million and is on track to reach $50 million in revenue by the end of the year. When I asked Anand how many users pay for the $10 monthly subscription, he didn’t give a number but noted “monetization wasn't a focus till four or five months ago.”\n\n“Since I've been on board, it's very clear we do need to monetize. And we've had, I think, almost 250 percent subscriber growth in the last six months. So the paid user base is growing quite, quite well,” Anand says. Character.AI recently introduced advertisements, including reward ads (where users can choose to watch an ad to get access to on-platform incentives), to help monetize in countries where subscriptions aren’t feasible, he tells me.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"selling\", \"work\", \"startup\", \"ai\", \"revenue\", \"company\", \"agi\", \"anand\", \"months\", \"models\", \"characterai\", \"gave\", \"focus\"]", "content_hash": "18bca29dd59da5867d900ac6d23164515e6453d7299bd709dd9af7b7100d56a7", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:07.458316+00:00"}

The announcement marks the end of a technology that served as the primary gateway to the web for millions of users throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAOL confirmed the shutdown date in a help message to customers: \"AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. This service will no longer be available in AOL plans.\"\n\nAlong with the dial-up service, AOL announced it will retire its AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser on the same date. The dialer software managed the connection process between computers and AOL's network, while Shield was a web browser optimized for slower connections and older operating systems.\n\nAOL's dial-up service launched as \"America Online\" in 1991 as a closed commercial online service, with dial-up roots extending back to Quantum Link for Commodore computers in 1985. However, AOL didn't provide actual internet access yet: The ability to browse the web, access newsgroups, or use services like gopher launched in 1994. Before then, AOL users could only access content hosted on AOL's own servers.\n\nWhen AOL finally opened its gates to the internet in 1994, websites were measured in kilobytes, images were small and compressed, and video was essentially impossible. The AOL service grew alongside the web itself, peaking at over 25 million subscribers in the early 2000s before broadband adoption accelerated its decline.\n\nAccording to 2022 US Census data, approximately 175,000 American households still connect to the internet through dial-up services. These users typically live in rural areas where broadband infrastructure doesn't exist or remains prohibitively expensive to install.\n\nFor these users, the alternatives are limited. Satellite internet now serves between 2 million and 3 million US subscribers split between various services, offering speeds far exceeding dial-up but often with data caps and higher latency. Traditional broadband through DSL, cable, or fiber-optic connections serves the vast majority of US internet users but requires infrastructure investments that don't always make economic sense in sparsely populated areas.\n\nThe persistence of dial-up highlights the ongoing digital divide in the United States. While urban users enjoy gigabit fiber connections, some rural residents still rely on the same technology that powered the internet of 1995. Even basic tasks like loading a modern webpage—designed with the assumption of broadband speeds—can take minutes over a dial-up connection, or sometimes it doesn't work at all.\n\nThe gap between dial-up and modern internet connections is staggering. A typical dial-up connection delivered 0.056 megabits per second, while today's average fiber connection provides 500 Mbps—nearly 9,000 times faster. To put this in perspective, downloading a single high-resolution photo that loads instantly on broadband would take several minutes on dial-up. A movie that streams in real time on Netflix would require days of downloading. But for millions of Americans who lived through the dial-up era, these statistics tell only part of the story.\n\nThe Sound of the Early Internet\n\nFor those who came online before broadband, dial-up meant a specific ritual: clicking the dial button, hearing your modem dial a local access number, then listening to the distinctive handshake sequence—a cacophony of static, beeps, and hissing that indicated your computer was negotiating a connection with AOL's servers. Once connected, users paid by the hour or through monthly plans that offered limited hours of access.\n\nThe technology worked by converting digital data into audio signals that traveled over standard telephone lines, originally designed in the 19th century for voice calls. This meant users couldn't receive phone calls while online, leading to countless family disputes over internet time. The fastest consumer modems topped out at 56 kilobits per second under ideal conditions.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"aol\", \"online\", \"services\", \"connection\", \"shut\", \"service\", \"access\", \"users\", \"broadband\", \"internet\", \"web\", \"dialup\"]", "content_hash": "38bdb345321b5cddb5e6cf7c4696b4254d2272829ae6b9f7ba8fffa001d1ecac", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:08.816121+00:00"}

You’re in good company, as many of the WIRED Reviews team are also side sleepers. So are most Americans. The numbers vary across studies and depend on how rigidly you define “side sleeper,” but between half and three-quarters of people sleep on their side for at least part of the night.\n\nIf you're a side sleeper, you know how crucial it is that your bed keeps your back aligned while the hips and shoulders get some cushioning. Otherwise, it's a disaster. Without enough lumbar support, your middle is sinking in way farther than the rest of your body. Meanwhile, the hips and shoulders get that much more strain placed on them, especially if the bed is not forthcoming with pressure relief. It doesn't paint a cozy picture, which is why we side sleepers want something that accomplishes the lumbar support, pressure relief, and comfortability trifecta.\n\nMany of our testers side-sleep and can speak to the necessity of these mattress performance factors firsthand, including Reviews team director Martin Cizmar and sleep writer Julia Forbes, a certified sleep science coach. It's never so simple as just lying down on a bed and saying “Eureka!” That's why we spend at least a week with each bed to monitor our daily sleep and feelings toward each one.

Just one month after the premiere of the new live-action series Ironheart (see below) comes this new animated anthology series that delves even further into the Wakanda mythology. Two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Coogler—the man behind both Black Panther movies—developed this four-episode prequel in which the Hatut Zaraze, aka Wakanda’s “War Dogs,” embark on adventure-filled missions to retrieve long-lost Vibranium artifacts.\n\nIronheart\n\nRyan Coogler is responsible for what is arguably the best movie in the MCU (2018’s Black Panther), and now he’s executive producing one of its most interesting small-screen endeavors. Playwright Chinaka Hodge created this series, which picks up right after the events featured in 2022’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It stars Dominique Thorne, who reprises her role as Riri Williams, aka Ironheart, a brilliant MIT student who has successfully managed to create a Tony Stark–like suit of armor. It gives her the kind of invincibility that changes her outlook on the world—and leads her down a pothole-filled path that could see her heroic character go the way of the antihero in a way that critics have described as being similar to The Sopranos’ Tony Soprano and Breaking Bad’s Walter White.\n\nUnderdogs\n\nRyan Reynolds brings his penchant for turning genres on their heads to National Geographic with a brand-new kind of nature special. The Deadpool star narrates and serves as executive producer on this fun docuseries which puts the spotlight on the “underdogs” of the animal kingdom—those creatures and critters who don’t always warrant the same amount of respect as the kings and queens they share real estate with. Or, as Reynolds calls them, the “super zeroes.”\n\nDoctor Who\n\nSpring 2024 marked the beginning of a new era for Doctor Who fans when Ncuti Gatwa was officially handed the sonic screwdriver to take the legendary sci-fi series in new directions as the Fifteenth Doctor. He did it all over again with a second season, which aired a game-changing finale on May 31 that has viewers wondering where the Doctor will be headed next. Russell T. Davies is also back to oversee all the time-traveling shenanigans as the latest incarnation of the Time Lord journeys through space and time with companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), and new addition Belinda Chandra (Varada Sethu). While the series will keep its standing as a BBC staple in the UK and Ireland, American audiences will need to head to Disney+ to experience it all.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Underworld\n\nThere are two types of people in this world: those who think there are more Star Wars movies and TV shows that one person needs and those who are counting down the days until The Mandalorian & Grogu arrives in theaters next year. If you’re part of that latter group, you’re in good company—and have plenty of series to choose from, including this six-part anthology that follows 2022’s Tales of the Jedi and last year’s Tales of the Empire (see below). In true Star Wars style, it tells the story of two villains, former assassin/bounty hunter Asajj Ventress and outlaw Cad Bane, who form an unlikely alliance in an attempt to build new lives for themselves, until Bane catches up with an old colleague, who has switched sides to become a law-abiding marshal. Dark versus light battle it out once more.\n\nAndor\n\nAndor, which just scored 14 Emmy nominations, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, is something of a miracle. Created by Tony Gilroy, the two-time Oscar nominee behind Michael Clayton and a writer on the Bourne movies, it’s the origin story of one of Rogue One's most beloved characters, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). Set in the early years of the Rebellion, it charts Andor’s path to becoming one of the most integral of the Rebels. With a supporting cast that includes Fiona Shaw and Stellan Skarsgård, it features a fantastic score from Nicholas Britell (Moonlight, Succession). After spending so much time with Mandalorians and Jedis, it’s a welcome reprieve and perhaps the closest thing to prestige TV the Star Wars universe has released.\n\nOklahoma City Bombing: One Day in America\n\nThirty years after the Oklahoma City Bombing, Nat Geo takes a look back at the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The three-part docuseries features rarely seen archival footage and interviews with survivors who are sharing their harrowing stories for the first time. While it’s undoubtedly a tragic story, the series also recounts the inspiring way in which it united Americans.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nDaredevil fans were devastated when the original Netflix series was canceled in 2018, but Charlie Cox never strayed far from his title role for too long. He popped up as Matt Murdock/Daredevil in MCU movies (Spider-Man: No Way Home) and TV shows (She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Echo, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man), all the while biding his time until his eponymous series came back. Seven years and one massive overhaul later, fans seem to think it was worth the wait. Born Again sees Cox facing off against crime lord turned mayoral candidate Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) once more. There’s also a darkness to the series that seems to borrow a page from Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight playbook, though it’s not as elegant in its execution. Still, it’s a solid crime drama that sets itself apart from many other MCU series thanks to its more mature tone. Whether you were into the Netflix series or not, it might be time to dig in.\n\nWin or Lose\n\nWill Forte, Rhea Seehorn, Ian Chen, Melissa Villaseñor, and Izaac Wang are among the dozens of actors and comedians who lend their voices to Pixar’s very first original animated series. Over the course of eight episodes, this charming series plays out the same events that occur in the week leading up to a middle school softball team’s championship game from the perspective of various characters, including a wise bead of sweat known as Sweaty (and voiced by comedian Jo Firestone). If the title sounds familiar to you, it might be because the series created some controversy back in December when it was revealed that a transgender character’s storyline had been cut from the series. Disney’s reasoning? “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\n\nFour years after it was first announced, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man arrived early this year. The animated series dares to imagine what kind of chaos might have ensued if Peter Parker (Hudson Thames) had been mentored by baddie Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Colman Domingo) instead of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Oh, the horror (and fun)! A second season has already been confirmed, though likely won’t premiere until 2026.\n\nGoosebumps: The Vanishing\n\nFor more than 30 years, R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps books have fed the nightmares of young readers—much to their delight (well, usually). Now Disney is inspiring a whole new generation of horror lovers with this fun series, which follows the lives of a group of high schoolers who begin to unravel the terrifying truth about a decades-old murder—and the roles their nearest and dearest might have played in it—in their otherwise picture-perfect hometown. The always-affable Justin Long starred as a teacher who may or may not be possessed in season 1 of this anthology series. Its second, and final, season brought an extended title (Goosebumps: The Vanishing), a new cast (including Friends star David Schwimmer), and a whole new set of nightmares.\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\n\nDo you love Star Wars but wish it had more Warriors/The Wizard of Oz/The Brave Little Toaster energy? Lucasfilm has heard your cries and is here to oblige. For Skeleton Crew, they assembled a gang of four youths who get lost in the Star Wars universe and try to find their way home with the help of Jude Law, who plays an “enigmatic scoundrel\" named Jod. OK, so Star Wars probably already has enough of those, but who cares? The real treasure is the friends you'll make along the way.\n\nLuther\n\nAdd DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) to the long list of “conflicted cops who mean well.” It's a character archetype that TV viewers have seen dozens of times before, but few actors take it to the level that Elba does. Forget bending the rules—Luther dismantles them and has no regrets. Planting evidence? Killing a criminal? Buddying up to a homicidal sociopath who can take the real “bad guys” out on your behalf? Luther has seen and done it all in the name of justice. Somehow it’s hard not to root for him at every turn.\n\nLego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy\n\nSig Greebling (Stranger Things’ Gaten Matarazzo) discovers an ancient relic that alters the history of the universe—turning Jar Jar Binks into a lightsaber-wielding Sith and Luke Skywalker into Just Some Guy. With the help of a wise old Jedi, Sig must do what he can to piece things back together. Sure, the plotline has all the makings of a typical Star Wars story, but with Mark Hamill and Ahmed Best lending their voices to the minifig versions of the characters that made them famous, it also does so in a way that pokes just the right amount of fun at the canon.\n\nAgatha All Along\n\nAfter Kathryn Hahn became the (not-so-surprising) breakout star of 2021’s WandaVision miniseries (more on that below), MCU fans were thrilled—but, again, not surprised—when she nabbed her own series with Agatha All Along. The long-awaited spinoff takes place three years after the events of WandaVision, with witch Agatha (now stripped of all her magical powers) enlisting a teenager (Joe Locke) and a new coven to help her regain her status as HWIC. Aubrey Plaza, Patti LuPone, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp round out the stellar cast.\n\nBluey\n\nYes, Bluey is technically a children’s show. But everyone is welcome to enjoy this animated series from Australia, which centers around an endlessly curious blue heeler pup named Bluey and her family (mom, dad, and little sister). The show’s brevity—each episode clocks in at around eight minutes, and there are also mini episodes that are half that run time—is part of what makes it such a fun and easy watch. But the exploration of everyday feelings and emotions that everyone can relate to (humans, too) have made it a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Rose Byrne, Natalie Portman, and Eva Mendes are among the stars who have lent their voices to the show.\n\nArctic Ascent With Alex Honnold\n\nIn Free Solo (which is also streaming on Disney+), climber Alex Honnold dared to do the unthinkable, becoming the first person to free solo climb the 3,000-foot rock wall of Yosemite’s El Capitan. For most people, that dauntless endeavor would have been enough adventure for one lifetime. But Alex Honnold is not most people, as this three-part National Geographic docuseries makes clear. Here, he travels to Greenland with fellow climbers to conquer more unclimbed spaces in one of the most remote corners of the world. Vicarious anxiety never felt so exciting.\n\nStar Wars: Young Jedi Adventures\n\nIf helping to raise a new generation of Star Wars geeks was even a small part of your reason for having kids, this animated series, which is basically the Star Wars version of Muppet Babies, is a great place to start their education. Set during the High Republic era, approximately 200 years before the events of The Phantom Menace, it follows a group of young Jedis—Jedi Lites—who are sometimes stumbling their way through learning the ways of the Force. Like any good kid series, it also teaches important lessons about life and making a positive difference in the world.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nA Jedi turning to the Dark Side is a concept as old as the Star Wars franchise itself, and not something fans have given much thought to in terms of the “why.” But this Disney+ series dares to ask that question, and plays out a bit like a true crime procedural in a sci-fi landscape. Carrie-Anne Moss stars as a Jedi Master, and if her character seems a bit like Trinity from The Matrix series, that’s by design. Series creator Leslye Headland told Empire that the character owes much of its inspiration to the Wachowskis’ movies and that Moss’ Indara is basically “Trinity with a lightsaber.” In August, Disney announced that one season is all we’re going to get of The Acolyte, so savor all eight episodes.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Empire\n\nIt’s been more than five years since Disney released the last Star Wars movie, and The Mandalorian & Grogu won't arrive until May 22, 2026. Fortunately, Disney+ has plenty of TV series to fill the void, including this animated anthology that adds new stories about the franchise’s Galactic empire, in the same time period in which the original trilogy existed. It follows the very different journeys of two characters: Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto), a Force-sensitive human and member of the Nightsister coven who, after being one of the few of her people to survive the Clone Wars, is seeking revenge. Meanwhile, Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger) is a former Jedi who is questioning her own disillusionment with the order and what her road ahead looks like. Both are forced to make decisions that will change their individual destinies, and the galaxy far, far away with it.\n\nX-Men '97\n\nOf all the big-budget X-Men movies and TV shows that have existed over the years, it’s hard to believe that a cartoon series from the ’90s is one of the most beloved entries. But it’s true—and has a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score to prove it. When the revival arrived in 2024, many of the original voice actors returned to reclaim their characters, who must learn how to navigate a world without Professor Xavier to guide them. The events of this series pick up just one year after the point where the original show (which you can read more about below) ended.\n\nRenegade Nell\n\nLouisa Harland shines as Nell Jackson, the renegade of the title, who accidentally becomes one of the most feared highwaywomen in 18th-century England after she is framed for murder. Of course, this being a Disney series, it’s best to expect something a little magical—which in Nell’s case is Billy Blind, a magical sprite sent to help her realize her true destiny. What is surprising is that the series, which is perfectly suited to teens and their families, was created by Sally Wainwright, the brilliant mind behind such adult-themed series as Happy Valley and Gentleman Jack.\n\nDinosaurs\n\nNineties kids no doubt remember this sitcom about a family of dinosaurs. Earl Sinclair is a fortysomething megalosaurus living with his family in Pangaea circa 60,000,000 BC. While his days are spent working as a tree pusher (yep, he pushes over trees), he lives for his family: wife Fran and kids Robbie, Charlene, and Baby Sinclair, whose running gag of hitting his dad over the head with a frying pan and shouting “Gotta love me!” never gets old. Not even three decades on.\n\nEcho\n\nThis Marvel series continues the studio’s recent trend of shining a spotlight on its fearless—and complicated—female characters. In this case, that character is Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox), aka Echo, who is best known to audiences as a baddie from Hawkeye. But over the course of its relatively short five episodes, we learn why Maya—one of the MCU’s few deaf characters—must reconcile the events of her past and reconnect with her Native American roots in order to confront the future she has created for herself. Cox may be a relative newcomer to Hollywood, but she deftly manages to shoulder the weight of an entire MCU series.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians\n\nNearly 20 years after the release of the first book in Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series, this small-screen adaptation of that first title is being praised for how faithful it has remained to Riordan’s beloved words. Being a tween is hard enough, but for 12-year-old Perseus “Percy” Jackson (Walker Scobell) it gets even harder when he learns he's the son of Poseidon, god of the sea, and that he has pissed off his uncle, Zeus, who believes that Percy has stolen his thunderbolt. (And you thought having a zit was bad!) Fortunately for Percy there is Camp Half-Blood—a place where demigods like himself can learn to harness their powers and use them for good. It’s there that Percy learns the whole “with great power comes great responsibility” thing and embraces it—even if he'd rather be playing video games with his friends. A second season is set to arrive in December, with Season 3 already in the works.\n\nBehind the Attraction\n\nDisneyland, Walt Disney’s very first theme park, opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955. In the 70 years since, Disney parks have become a worldwide phenomenon and inspired rabid fan bases who make annual (if not more frequent) pilgrimages to these so-called Happiest Places on Earth. But what goes on behind the scenes? From the creation of major attractions like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean to its bustling food scene (Dole Whip, anyone?), this docuseries goes behind the scenes of the world’s most famous amusement parks.\n\nLoki\n\nThe MCU is exhaustingly huge. Yet while Loki is undoubtedly part of that universe, the series could just as easily work as a stand-alone piece, and it's all the more fun and surprising as a result. There are enough plot twists, silly one-liners, and time-travel antics to keep everyone entertained, and even a wisecracking alligator. If that doesn’t do it, Loki has a visual effects budget that would put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. Sure, it’s not the most intellectually stimulating show out there, but Tom Hiddleston does a great job of turning Loki into a fairly complex, interesting character. No word yet on whether there might be a third season in Loki’s future—and even Hiddleston is in the dark. “I truly don’t know,” he admitted to Variety in 2024, adding: “There have been other times when I thought that it was the end and I have been mistaken. But if this is the end, I'm so proud of where we ended up.”\n\nDaredevil\n\nBefore Disney+ became the home for all of Marvel’s TV content, Netflix was the place to find it—beginning with Daredevil, in which blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) spends his days seeking justice and his nights looking for revenge as a masked vigilante attempting to rid his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of its criminal element. While the series ended in 2018, Cox has reprised his role for a new series, Daredevil: Born Again, which arrived in early March (see above).\n\nAhsoka\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: Wait, another Star Wars series? And we don’t blame you for asking the question. But for old-school franchise fans, Ahsoka just might surprise you. Rosario Dawson reprises the title role as Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi who studied under Anakin Skywalker, which she first played in season 2 of The Mandalorian. Here, Ahsoka sets off on a journey to locate Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen, Mads’ brother)—a master manipulator who seems to be on a mission to become the grand ruler of the galaxy. A second season is scheduled to begin production in April, and will welcome Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker back into the Star Wars fold.\n\nThe Wonder Years\n\nIn 2021, writer-producer Saladin K. Patterson (Frasier, The Bernie Mac Show) rebooted the award-winning, and much beloved, series The Wonder Years for a new generation. Don Cheadle narrates the adventures of Dean Williams (Elisha “EJ” Williams), as he comes of age in Montgomery, Alabama, in the final years of the Civil Rights Movement. Both seasons of the worthwhile series are now streaming—as are all six seasons of the original series, which premiered in 1988.\n\nKizazi Moto: Generation Fire\n\nWhile Black Panther may have gotten an official sequel with 2022’s Wakanda Forever (which is, of course, available to stream on Disney+), this animated anthology series is in many ways a spiritual successor to that Oscar-winning MCU flick. More than a dozen up-and-coming African storytellers were handpicked to write and/or direct these 10 short films, which build on the makers’ cultures and histories to paint a fascinating, gorgeously animated—and often dystopian—picture of Afrofuturism.\n\nAmerican Born Chinese\n\nOscar winners—and Everything Everywhere All at Once costars—Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan reunite for this Disney+ original series. Jin Wang (Ben Wang) is your typical teenager who’s just trying to get through the day of dealing with high school social hierarchies. But his life is forever altered when he’s asked to serve as a mentor to Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), a foreign exchange student who is hiding some pretty big secrets. Like that he’s actually on an otherworldly mission from the heavenly realm and has chosen Jin to serve as his guide. Part coming-of-age tale and part mythological fantasy, the single-season series is a formidable adaptation of Gene Yang’s graphic novel.\n\nStar Wars: Visions\n\nFor a franchise as varied and diverse as Star Wars, sometimes its output can feel a little same-y. That’s not the case with Visions. The point of the anthology series is to provide “all-new, creative” takes on the Star Wars universe. The first series, which premiered in 2021, featured nine installments from some of the best anime studios in Japan, including Kamikaze Douga and Trigger. The second anthology, which arrived in 2023, broadens the scope further, incorporating work from studios in India, Ireland, Spain, Chile, France, South Africa, the US, and the UK. If you’re looking for the best one-off tales from the Star Wars universe, look no further.\n\nThe Mandalorian\n\nThe Mandalorian was, and is, exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed. Everything about this Jon Favreau series feels like classic TV—from the episodic adventures to the cameos. Set in the outer reaches of the galaxy, it follows a moody, masked Mandalorian bounty hunter (WIRED cover star Pedro Pascal) and really delivers on the hype with its retro-futuristic robots, salty Space Western vibes, lack of Skywalker baggage, and, of course, Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). The Mandalorian really set the tone for what a great Star Wars series could be, and while not every subsequent show has been as good, others, like Andor, have lived up to the precedent it set—and proved Star Wars stories can make for great TV. There's still no official word on a fourth season, but there is one more exciting adventure on the horizon: a movie, The Mandalorian & Grogu, which just got a May 22, 2026 release date.\n\nMs. Marvel\n\nWith Ms. Marvel, Disney manages to combine its knack for producing coming-of-age tween fare with its new role as caretaker of the MCU. Iman Vellani charms as Kamala Khan, an Avengers-obsessed high schooler from Jersey City who feels like an outsider in most areas of her life. But when a gold bangle arrives from her grandmother in Pakistan, Kamala begins to realize that all the time she's spent fantasizing about what life would be like with superpowers might have been preparing her for real life. With one foot in the teen drama world and the other in the comic book universe, Ms. Marvel—which just happens to feature Marvel’s first Muslim superhero—marks yet another admirable step forward for the company in both innovation and inclusion. In 2023, Vellani’s Ms. Marvel made the leap to the big screen to star alongside Brie Larson in The Marvels.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\nEwan McGregor has not always had the kindest words for the Star Wars prequels in which he first played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi—a role he inherited from Alec Guinness, who also had plenty of less-than-favorable things to say about the franchise. So it was somewhat surprising when Lucasfilm announced that McGregor would be donning his Jedi gear again to star in a stand-alone Star Wars series for Disney+. (Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has already said there will not be a second season.) In many ways, however, it allowed McGregor and former costar Hayden Christensen to course-correct some of their earlier work, as it follows a downtrodden Obi-Wan attempting to process his personal and professional disappointment over losing Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) to the Dark Side.\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back\n\nIn January 1969, just more than a year before they announced they were breaking up, the Beatles allowed a film crew unprecedented access to the creative process and recording of Let It Be, which would be their final studio album. Fifty years later, Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson was presented with the nearly 60 hours of film footage and more than 150 hours of audio that resulted from this project, and he remastered it and turned it into a three-part docuseries. Whether you’re already a Beatles fan or not, the documentary is a fascinating look at the creative process of one of the music world’s most influential bands as they work against the clock to finish recording an album, decide to have a free concert on their label’s rooftop, and occasionally butt heads. Knowing what the subjects do not know—that this will be the last time they perform live together or record an album—only adds to the project’s intimacy. The miniseries won all five Emmys it was nominated for in 2022, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nMoon Knight\n\nOscar Isaac brings yet another marquee name to Marvel’s growing roster of all-star talents with Moon Night. Here, Isaac plays a man with dissociative identity disorder, giving us not one but three distinct characters: mercenary Mark Spector, British gift shop employee Steven Grant, and the mysterious—and seemingly ominous—Jake Lockley. Ultimately, he must face off against himself to get the answers he’s seeking. For Moon Knight, Isaac told Empire that he was thrilled to be able to do something “really fucking nutty on a major stage”—and he delivers.\n\nThe Muppet Show\n\nWhile The Muppet Show, which ran for five seasons between 1976 and 1981, is considered a piece of classic television today, it wasn’t always smooth sailing for creator Jim Henson. Henson produced two one-off Muppet specials that were intended to take the show into prime time, but neither came to fruition. Fortunately, the Muppets did have a recurring gig in “The Land of Gorch” sketches that aired during Saturday Night Live’s first season, as viewers of Jason Reitman's Saturday Night learned. When SNL became a hit, Henson knew that there was a potentially massive audience for an adult-oriented Muppet show (not to mention celebrity connections to entice plenty of A-list names to host). The rest is Muppet history.\n\nThe Punisher\n\nThe Punisher is yet another Netflix-turned-Disney+ Marvel series that also happens to be a spinoff of Daredevil. Like Daredevil, the Punisher (real name: Frank Castle, played by Jon Bernthal) is a vigilante who seems to relish exacting revenge, regardless of the results. He and Daredevil operate within the same universe, and while the Punisher sort of admires Daredevil’s quest for true justice, Daredevil despises the Punisher’s by-any-means-necessary methods. Bernthal brings an intensity to the role that, while undoubtedly violent, also has a sense of humor about it.\n\nBoy Meets World\n\nIf ABC’s TGIF lineup wasn’t a part of your night as a kid, you clearly didn’t grow up in the ’90s. But Disney+ is happy to right that wrong by housing all seven seasons of the teen sitcom in its library. Corey Matthews (Ben Savage) deals with the ups and downs of growing up and ever-evolving relationships with friends and family—plus that one teacher, Mr. Feeny (William Daniels)—who always has the right answer to your problems, whether you like it or not. As the show progressed and the kids grew up, serious issues like drugs and sex were thrown into the mix, which didn’t always please the network. When the show aired on the original Disney Channel, a few episodes weren’t included in the lineup because of the more mature subject matter. You can also check out all three seasons of Girl Meets World, the series reboot (which features Corey as the parent and Mr. Feeny) when you’re done.\n\nJessica Jones\n\nJust about six months after Daredevil arrived on the scene, Netflix took another chance on a Marvel property with Jessica Jones. In this dark dive into the world of superheroes, Krysten Ritter plays a private investigator who gave up her days as a superhero after a major catastrophe. But you can’t deny who you are, as Jessica discovers when it seems like every case that comes her way forces her to confront her past—and the supervillain Kilgrave (David Tennant), who turned her into a shell of her former self.\n\nHawkeye\n\nYet another in an ever growing string of spinoff TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hawkeye gives some long overdue attention to Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton, who in many ways has often seemed like the forgotten Avenger. The supernaturally skilled archer is in most of the ensemble Avengers films, but this Disney+ series marks his first solo outing. The show sees Hawkeye teaming up with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), a precocious twentysomething who shares his skills for slinging arrows but lacks his eye for danger. It’s set during the holidays, and there are shades of Die Hard as the eponymous character tries to save the day and make it home in time for Christmas. Let the arguments about whether it’s a Christmas TV show begin.\n\nMonsters at Work\n\nMonsters at Work is the Monsters, Inc. spinoff you didn’t know you needed. It picks up the action six months after the end of the iconic Pixar movie—after Sully and his friend and colleague Mike (a giant green eyeball) have reworked the Monstropolis energy grid to run on laughter instead of children’s screams.\n\nThe Bad Batch\n\nYes, Disney really is milking its Star Wars properties for all they’re worth. The Bad Batch is an animated spinoff series set in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy in the overarching timeline. It follows a group of clone soldiers with genetic defects that give them individual traits and personalities, making them well suited to taking on daring mercenary missions. All three seasons are available to stream.\n\nWandaVision\n\nThis slow-burning sitcom parody is unexpectedly compelling. For the first couple of episodes, even hardened Marvel fans will have very little idea what’s going on, as Avengers Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live out an idyllic family life in black-and-white 1950s suburbia. Quickly, it becomes clear that something is wrong in the quiet town of Westview, as the world of the show ties into the wider MCU. Olsen reprises her role in Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which picks up right after the events of WandaVision.\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n\nAfter the surreal sitcom stylings of WandaVision, the second Marvel show to land on Disney+ covers more familiar ground. It's an action-packed thriller that follows Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) as they try to fill the void left by Captain America in the months after the events of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nStar Wars Rebels\n\nAccessible for kids and adults alike—and undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars TV series on Disney+—this animated series follows a group of rebels led by the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and featuring his force-sensitive Padawan, Ezra Bridger (Ezra Gray). Fan favorite Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) is another regular character across its four seasons, which do a neat job of fleshing out the time between the end of the prequel trilogy and the beginning of the original one.\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nHave you got some time on your hands? Well, the 36 seasons of The Simpsons currently streaming on Disney+ should keep you busy. What can be said about one of the longest-running—and arguably most famous—animated TV shows ever made? While the first season is a little patchy by today’s standards, and there are ongoing arguments about when the show went from essential viewing to neglected cash cow, whatever your view, there are literally weeks worth of entertainment here.\n\nX-Men: The Animated Series\n\nIf you really want to nerd out, this critically acclaimed animated X-Men series from the ’90s is worth a watch. In fact, the first two films in the live-action movie franchise drew heavily from this cartoon, which serves as a nice reminder of what can be done with rich source material.\n\nMarvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nThis seven-season series, which is for serious Marvel fans, revolves around S.H.I.E.L.D.’s less super agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). The first season takes a while to warm up, but it really hits its stride in its second and especially third seasons, and it eventually ramps up with a complex plot that ties into the films.\n\nAgent Carter\n\nAgent Carter is a better show than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it struggled to find an audience during its two seasons. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Peggy Carter from several MCU films in this 1940s-set series, where she doubles as an agent for the US government while helping Howard Stark (Tony’s dad) out of more than one jam. The two seasons stretch to only 18 episodes, so it’s a quick watch, but one worth making the time for.\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars\n\nThis is another Star Wars animated show worth seeking out, though it’s not to be confused with the equally worthy 2003 animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars from legendary Samurai Jack creator Genndy Tartakovsky. Both series deal with the period between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith and chronicle the rise of Anakin Skywalker from arrogant Padawan to powerful Jedi Master.\n\nInside Pixar\n\nThere’s a lot of behind-the-scenes content on Disney+. These are short clips that, in another age, would have been confined to the DVD extras menu. But this series of 20-minute documentaries on different Pixar movies offers a fascinating insight into the animated hit machine.\n\nWhat If …?\n\nHere’s an animated series based on one simple question: What if? The Watcher, played by Jeffrey Wright, is an extraterrestrial being who observes the multiverse, occasionally making minor changes to influence events. This series looks at how events in the Marvel movies would have turned out differently if they’d had a Sliding Doors moment. The first episode follows an alternate timeline in which Steve Rogers remains a scrawny sidekick and Agent Carter becomes a Union Jack-draped super soldier. Actors from the films reprise their roles, including Josh Brolin as Thanos, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Karen Gillan as Nebula.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"seasons\", \"star\", \"right\", \"animated\", \"best\", \"marvel\", \"series\", \"55\", \"disney\", \"tv\", \"season\", \"shows\", \"wars\"]", "content_hash": "29ff78d5c90083b06a86284a99886da30ddc18b2bcce60dd757f6e8196c2c61f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:10.415487+00:00"}

But the market for cycles with an electric assist has existed for considerably longer, and a number of companies predate the recent surge. One of them, Rad Power, has been around long enough that it was already an established presence when we first reviewed its hardware four years ago.\n\nThe company offers a mix of cargo, folding, and commuter bikes, all with electric assists. Having looked at a cargo version last time around, we decided to try out one of the commuter bikes this time. The Radster comes in road and trail versions (we tried the road). It's an incredibly solidly made bike with equally solid components, and it has very good implementations of a few things that other manufacturers haven't handled all that well. It also can switch among the three classes of e-bikes using a menu option; unfortunately, nothing else about the bike's performance seems to change with the switch.\n\nThe Radster is priced a bit higher than a lot of its budget competitors. So, if you're shopping, you'll have to think a bit about whether some of these features matter to you.\n\nA solid option\n\nOne thing that is very clear early: The Radster is a very solid bike with a robust frame. While the frame is step-through, it has some added bracing just above the cranks. These two bars, one on each side of the frame, link the down tube to the seat tube and extend to form part of the rear triangle. While this means you'll have to step a bit higher to get in a position to mount the bike, they contribute to the sense that this is a frame that will withstand years of daily use.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"bike\", \"number\", \"tube\", \"radster\", \"road\", \"nonradical\", \"solid\", \"bit\", \"powers\", \"bikes\", \"rad\", \"frame\", \"commuter\", \"youll\"]", "content_hash": "0c917dce2a95a9236ceb5393ef168420e753c1489d425c6f03b399784f76ffab", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:12.576126+00:00"}

There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket's nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.\n\nThe Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There's an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket's Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit. You can watch ULA's live launch webcast below.\n\nThe Vulcan rocket flew two demonstration missions in 2024, capping a lengthy campaign to design, build, and test ULA's new launch vehicle before the Space Force could declare it ready for operational service.\n\nNow, ULA is poised to begin ticking off a backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches the company has sold to commercial and government customers.

For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.\n\nThese boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters fell off the launcher moments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"test\", \"secrecy\", \"key\", \"force\", \"rockets\", \"solid\", \"heights\", \"rocket\", \"space\", \"boosters\", \"ahead\", \"launch\", \"vulcan\", \"officials\", \"ulas\"]", "content_hash": "f6c60a699e18f2d2e375598e8a6800f4c5a6c348a69e7e00c7cbc0749fae9264", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:13.693521+00:00"}

But with AI models, this approach rarely works, and the urge to ask reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what these systems are and how they operate.\n\nA recent incident with Replit's AI coding assistant perfectly illustrates this problem. When the AI tool deleted a production database, user Jason Lemkin asked it about rollback capabilities. The AI model confidently claimed rollbacks were \"impossible in this case\" and that it had \"destroyed all database versions.\" This turned out to be completely wrong—the rollback feature worked fine when Lemkin tried it himself.\n\nAnd after xAI recently reversed a temporary suspension of the Grok chatbot, users asked it directly for explanations. It offered multiple conflicting reasons for its absence, some of which were controversial enough that NBC reporters wrote about Grok as if it were a person with a consistent point of view, titling an article, \"xAI's Grok offers political explanations for why it was pulled offline.\"\n\nWhy would an AI system provide such confidently incorrect information about its own capabilities or mistakes?

New discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope — a joint project by the European Space Agency(ESA), NASA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) — aren’t just surprising, they’re contradicting our deepest assumptions about how the universe works.\n\nFundamentally, it seems the universe may not be playing by the rules we mostly thought we understood.\n\nSo, what could it all mean for space exploration, space technology, and future deep tech? And what should space tech businesses, inventors, investors, and VC funds in Europe be considering as a result of the latest discoveries?\n\nAt Beyond Earth Ventures, we’re all about startups building rockets, AIs for satellites, space biotech, and fusion breakthroughs.\n\nBut as space fanatics, we also like to look deeper, beyond cap tables and pitch decks, into the places where theory breaks and mystery begins.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nEnter the $10bn Webb telescope, sent into orbit from Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, to look at the oldest light in the universe. Launched in 2021, the machine has been fully operational since July 2022.\n\nWebb isn’t just an upgrade from Hubble. It’s a time machine, an infrared sentinel, and — maybe most importantly — a destroyer of comfortable scientific assumptions.\n\nThanks to its findings, it’s becoming clear that we’re on the cusp of a major shift in theoretical physics and cosmology. Over the next few years, expect a wave of bold new theories, revisions to textbooks, and a renewed debate about everything from gravity to the origin of galaxies.\n\nBefore we consider the implications, let’s zoom out and consider the big discoveries from Webb that punch holes in what we thought we knew about the universe. Some of these are already triggering theoretical crises. Others might trigger entirely new fields of inquiry and invention.\n\nThe biggest revolutions start when theory no longer matches data. That’s what happened with quantum mechanics. With general relativity. With DNA. And maybe, with the Webb Telescope.\n\nHere are 10 of its discoveries challenging our theories about the universe:\n\n1. The universe is expanding faster than it should\n\nWe knew about the “Hubble Tension,” but Webb just confirmed it with more precision. According to the maths, the universe is expanding at 70–76 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc) — much faster than the 67 km/s/Mpc predicted by models based on the early universe (the cosmic microwave background). Translation? Something in our physics is wrong, or at least incomplete. A tweak to dark energy? A new force? A misunderstood early universe? The door is open.\n\n2. Galaxies grew up too fast\n\nWebb spotted fully-grown, massive galaxies just 500–700 million years after the Big Bang. These things are as large as the Milky Way, but their early appearance defies established science. According to the standard cosmological models, they simply shouldn’t exist yet. Theories say galaxies grow slowly. Reality says: they bulked up fast. Either we’re missing a trick — or the early universe was a lot more efficient than we thought.\n\n3. Dark matter may be wrong — MOND was right?\n\nThis one’s controversial: Webb’s findings align more with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) than the prevailing dark matter theory. MOND has long been the underdog of gravity theories. But if early galaxies are brighter and bigger than expected — just as MOND predicted — we may need to reconsider which invisible hand is shaping the cosmos.\n\n4. Black holes were way too ambitious\n\nHow do you get a 9-million-solar-mass black hole only 570 million years after the Big Bang? That’s what Webb found. This is astonishing because, according to current models, there simply wasn’t enough time or material in the early universe to grow such colossal black holes so quickly — suggesting either unknown physics or entirely new formation pathways. The black holes in some early galaxies are 1,000x more massive (relative to the galaxy) than those in today’s universe. Either black holes formed via some exotic mechanism — or they started as something much bigger than stars.\n\n5. Complex chemistry? This early?\n\nThe galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 is just 300 million years old, but it’s already rich in elements like nitrogen, which usually takes billions of years and several generations of stars to build up. How did those elements get there? Either the first stars formed and died much faster than we thought — or the Big Bang left us more “pre-built” than expected.\n\n6. Stars formed at warp speed\n\nWebb shows early galaxies as intense, explosive star factories — a surprise to scientists. Models expected slow, gradual star formation. Instead, it’s “giant balls of star formation.” Something — perhaps a lack of dust, or different physics — accelerated the timeline. And, again, the models can’t keep up.\n\n7. Planetary disks last longer than we thought\n\nPlanet-forming disks around stars were assumed to vanish quickly. But Webb sees them lasting 20–30 million years. That’s great news for exoplanet formation — and potentially for life. If planetary systems have more time to develop, life-friendly environments may be more common than we ever dared to hope.\n\n8. Galaxies were weirdly shaped\n\nHalf of early galaxies look like pool noodles or surfboards, not the small round blobs we expected. The standard model says structure comes later. But Webb’s showing us that galaxies got organised early — and in shapes we weren’t expecting. Something about angular momentum and matter dynamics in the early universe needs rethinking.\n\n9. Exoplanet atmosphere models are all wrong\n\nWebb’s ultra-precise spectroscopy revealed that our models of exoplanet atmospheres can’t reliably distinguish between different kinds. This shakes up everything from habitability estimates to the search for biosignatures. Basically, our “spectral fingerprints” are smudged — and it’s back to the drawing board.\n\n10. The cosmic web was already there\n\nWebb found a 3-million-light-year-long filament — part of the cosmic web — just 830 million years after the Big Bang. This structure was supposed to take billions of years to form. So either the early universe built things quickly, or we’ve fundamentally misunderstood the timeline.\n\nSo what does this mean for the tech ecosystem? For founders and VCs in deep tech, these findings aren’t just scientific trivia; they’re early signals.\n\nEurope’s ideas in focus\n\nIn our view, Europe is uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of innovation sparked by James Webb’s discoveries. The data streaming in is already catalysing new research efforts at leading centres like Germany’s Max Planck Institutes, the University of Cambridge in the UK, and ETH Zurich in Switzerland.\n\nIn the private sector, a new generation of European deep tech startups is rising to the challenge.\n\nSpace Forge (UK) is developing reusable satellites to enable in-space manufacturing of advanced materials — such as semiconductors — that could drastically reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, with major implications for the climate crisis.\n\nBioOrbit (UK) is advancing microgravity-enabled production of anti-cancer biologics, with the potential to shift some therapies from hospital IV drips to self-administered injections at home, radically improving patient access and comfort.\n\nAIrmo (Germany) is deploying a fleet of LIDAR-equipped satellites and drones to precisely monitor greenhouse gas emissions in real time — supporting industries in meeting increasingly stringent EU regulations to report GHG emissions.\n\nEuropean deep tech companies are increasingly supported by Horizon Europe, the EU’s flagship research and innovation programme (2021–2027) with a total budget of €95.5 billion. Horizon Europe backs high-risk, high-reward projects across climate, digital, and deep tech domains, serving as a critical bridge between frontier scientific discoveries — like those revealed by JWST — and breakthrough commercial applications.\n\nGaps in our understanding of the universe could open unexpected opportunities for European deep tech. Just as CERN put Europe at the forefront of high-energy physics, Webb could become a launchpad for the continent’s space tech industry.\n\nWebb’s discoveries could spark a new era of innovation by overturning everything we thought we knew about the universe. If the early universe is nothing like we expected, then what else might we be wrong about?\n\nCould the laws of physics themselves evolve? Are we missing hidden variables in space-time? Is dark matter an illusion, and if so, what’s really shaping galaxies? Could life have started earlier and more often than we imagine?\n\nEvery one of these questions could unlock a new wave of fundamental physics, new technologies, or even entirely new startup categories. From quantum gravity models to exotic materials to AI-designed cosmological simulations, there’s room here for founders to build at the edge of mystery.\n\nWhat next? Potentially a new generation of inventions, investors, and eye-opening discoveries. Europe is poised to take advantage.\n\nBy investing in deep tech, the continent can turn Webb’s revelations into commercial successes, shaping the future of science and society alike.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"deep\", \"galaxies\", \"telescope\", \"discoveries\", \"lessons\", \"shape\", \"european\", \"webb\", \"james\", \"physics\", \"universe\", \"tech\", \"space\", \"early\", \"models\"]", "content_hash": "75b4764a4c77944ab90a08e4c1a374f1aa3a51bc8414b1640939c8784494e3ca", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:18.716919+00:00"}

It doesn’t look like your typical lunch fare, but this unassuming dust could play a crucial role in the future of food.\n\nBekers is the co-founder of MicroHarvest, a Hamburg and Lisbon-based startup that turns agricultural waste streams into protein powder using microbes — tiny organisms that exist all around us. The vegan ingredient is already making its way into dog treats. If all goes to plan, human snacks like protein bars, shakes, and ice cream won’t be far behind.\n\nI visited the company’s Lisbon pilot plant on a sweltering summer afternoon last month. It’s tucked inside the Unicorn Factory, a sprawling industrial space on the city’s eastern edge that used to churn out pasta and cookies for the Portuguese military. Now, instead of carbs for soldiers, it’s housing bubbling vats of bacteria.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Unicorn Factory houses some of Portugal’s most promising startups. Credit: Unicorn Factory\n\nAt the centre of the lab sits a large steel fermenter with a small porthole, through which you can see a thick brown soup gurgling away. Inside, billions of microbes are feasting on leftover sugars from the agri-industry, multiplying like microscopic gremlins. Once they’ve done their job, they’re killed and dried into protein-rich powder.\n\n“We prefer to say they’re ‘inactivated’,” Bekers, who is originally from the Netherlands, tells TNW with a chuckle. “It sounds nicer.”\n\nThe final product looks like light brown flour and smells faintly like Marmite. It packs a serious nutritional punch — around 60% raw protein, plus a mix of fibre, amino acids, and other nutrients.\n\nMicroHarvest’s powder joins a crowded buffet of alt-protein options — think lab-grown chicken, algae nuggets, pea patties, and mycoprotein steaks. But Bekers is convinced that microbes earn their spot on the plate.\n\n“What we’re producing is much more efficient than plant or animal-based proteins,” she says. “You don’t need acres of land or gallons of water. Our microbes grow in days, not months or years, and they convert feed into protein with incredible efficiency.”\n\nA portal into the future of ferming? Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest’s fermentation process takes less than 24 hours — lightning fast compared to growing soy or raising cows. It is estimated to slash land use by 99% and cuts CO2 emissions by over 70% compared to beef.\n\nA 2022 study in Nature found that replacing just 20% of global beef consumption with microbial proteins could cut annual deforestation in half by 2050. Plus, bioreactors like MicroHarvest’s could be deployed pretty much anywhere there’s a significant agricultural industry.\n\nOf course, the idea of eating dried bacteria might raise a few eyebrows — or stomachs. But Bekers is quick to draw comparisons to foods we already know and love.\n\n“These are similar to the microbes you find in things like yoghurt, kimchi, or sauerkraut,” she says. “Food is a cultural phenomenon, and we get that. We’re not trying to replace your steak or convert everyone to veganism. We’re just adding another protein to the menu.”\n\nFermenting the future\n\nMicroHarvest’s protein powder can be added into all sorts of foods. It also makes for an effective thickening agent. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest is one of Europe’s best-known microbial protein producers, but the scene is bubbling with competition. Startups across the continent and beyond are experimenting with different microbes and feedstocks — from Germany’s Formo making alt dairy to the UK’s Enough turning fungi into meat.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate giants like Nestlé and Unilever are testing the waters through partnerships and pilot launches.\n\nGlobally, almost $1bn (€874mn) flowed into fermentation-based alt-protein startups last year, according to Dealroom data. Europe attracted nearly half of that, with 2024 marking the sector’s highest funding year ever on the continent.\n\nAlongside that, the EU unveiled a new €350mn funding strategy in July to accelerate the scale-up of fermentation tech, as the continent seeks to tackle its deep-rooted addiction to meat.\n\nEven replacing a portion of our protein consumption with a fermented alternative is a compelling proposition. It could significantly reduce the land and water needed for farming while slashing carbon emissions. But the transition is not without its challenges.\n\nFrom pets to people\n\nSwapping steak for microbes isn’t as easy as simply building more bioreactors. Fermented proteins currently face high production costs and a battle to win over sceptical consumers, whose opinions on food choices often become embroiled in culture wars.\n\nThen there’s the regulatory red tape. It’s unclear when — or even if — MicroHarvest will get the green light for human consumption. The lengthy approval process for alt-protein products has bogged down other startups in the space. One example is Dutch cultivated meat brand Meatable, which has spent years navigating the regulatory hurdles. Founded in 2018, the company is still awaiting approval to sell its products commercially. It’s now focusing on Singapore, where lawmakers have been more welcoming to alt-proteins than their counterparts in Europe.\n\nMicroHarvest nonetheless remains optimistic. The startup has already submitted a full dossier to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) seeking regulatory approval for human consumption of its fermented protein.\n\n“We’re really confident we’ll get it,” says Bekers. “We screened the full DNA of the strain, checked for any harmful potential, and submitted a very complete dossier.”\n\nMicroHarvest’s founders (left to right) Jonathan Roberz, Luisa Cruz, and Katelijne Bekers. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nFor now, MicroHarvest plans to scale through another customer segment: pets. Last year, MicroHarvest teamed up with Munich-based startup VegDog to launch its first commercial product — a vegan dog treat made with microbial protein.\n\nAnimal nutrition has fewer regulatory barriers than products for human consumption. The availability of conventional pet food and fish feed also falls short of current demand.\n\n“The pet and aquaculture industries are growing rapidly, but the supply of feed is not,” says Bekers, adding that pet food and fish feed already offer a strong path to profitability, even without the human market.\n\nMicroHarvest is now seeking Series B funding to open a new plant in 2027, with a planned capacity of 15,000 tonnes of product per year — 40 times its current output.\n\nBekers is tight-lipped on the location, but her fellow co-founder, Luísa Cruz, was eager to point out the benefits of doing business in her native Portugal.\n\n“If you want to operate a biotechnology company, Portugal is a great place to do it,” says Cruz, who earned her PhD in biotechnology at TU Delft in the Netherlands.\n\n“It has great universities for biotechnology and a lot of talent, which is why we decided to open our first plant here.”\n\nBacked by record private investment and fresh EU funding, fermentation-based proteins like MicroHarvest’s are bubbling with promise. But turning dead bacteria from pet snacks into mainstream meals won’t be easy.\n\nThe next few years will reveal if these microbial powders are a fleeting fad or the future of food. I’m sure cows will be silently betting on the latter outcome.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"turning\", \"regulatory\", \"bekers\", \"food\", \"snacks\", \"consumption\", \"bacteria\", \"lisbon\", \"dead\", \"treats\", \"protein\", \"microbial\", \"lab\", \"microbes\", \"proteins\", \"dog\", \"startups\", \"human\"]", "content_hash": "76fc56c6a0eda5daa039b0d88e8723b439cdd221f1c1df05ad8a73bc9b36c2d4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:19.343308+00:00"}

Regulatory bodies need to keep up by rolling out tighter regulations aimed at strengthening consumer protections and stabilising the market.\n\nAs EU lawmakers scramble to protect consumers, others worry they are smothering growth. Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty. The regulatory bodies are defending the public, but had restrictions been lighter, would HSBC have had more creative solutions for its customers, such as embedding personalised, data-first lending?\n\nBanks have been fearful of exploring innovative embedded lending solutions, as they were 15% more likely to receive formal enforcement action. However, in August 2024, HSBC decided the benefits were worth the compliance battle.\n\nWhile some argue that regulation can hinder innovation — with companies hesitant to invest in operations due to increased oversight — others state that additional regulation will increase innovation and, with that, see regulation as a key driver of their growth. So, who’s right?\n\nBreaking down the recent EU fintech regulations\n\nRecently, a few new regulations came into effect in the EU that have majorly impacted fintechs.\n\nDORA, implemented in January 2025, requires EU-established financial institutions (FIs) to implement processes and structures to help them respond to and recover from ICT-related disruption, providing them with extra digital resilience. Additionally, the AMLA is being introduced to give governments more assurance in combatting money laundering.\n\nDORA and the AMLA will apply to all FIs and their products and processes, but leave crypto outside their scope. That’s where MiCA comes in. Rolled out in December 2024, MiCA was drafted to protect individual crypto users.\n\nThe EU’s regulatory agenda — especially with the introduction of MiCA, DORA, and AMLA — is about tightening oversight. However, it is also part of a broader strategy to simplify and harmonise regulations, providing stability to the EU financial markets as a whole. The latest rulings strike a delicate balance between reassuring consumers and regulators, and easing the burden on regulated FIs.\n\nA new set of regulations may seem contradictory to the so-called Competitiveness Compass — published in January by the European Commission — which includes initiatives on simplifying and effectively implementing EU law. Nevertheless, these laws aim to replace fragmented national rules with unified EU-wide frameworks, making compliance clearer, faster, and more predictable.\n\nAs the digital finance ecosystem continues to accelerate, MiCA, DORA, and AMLA form a comprehensive framework. Collectively, they aim to balance innovation with financial stability, consumer protection, and security throughout the fintech sector.\n\nWill these updates support or slow innovation in fintech and banking?\n\nThis answer depends on the perspective. Recent EU regulations may slow innovation in the short term, particularly for the larger and well-established FIs like banks, but the future outlook looks more fruitful. These new rules are designed to support long-term stability.\n\nAs these three regulations require full harmonisation across the member states, they’re designed to reduce fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. A bigger and more uniform market will encourage cross-border activities, innovation, and competitiveness between fintechs and related service providers. The regulations also support the creation of better, more transparent products and services, helping to increase consumer and regulator trust, ultimately boosting customer adoption.\n\nIn short, this environment will offer greater opportunities for smaller and more agile fintechs to scale and compete long-term. For consumers and businesses, acting on the latest regulations results in more reliable and resilient services, which are much needed for essential functions like digital payments and lending.\n\nThese new regulations level the playing field, encouraging traditional banks and fintechs to compete on innovation and service quality rather than only on regulatory strengths. Moreover, a stable and secure financial system boosts the EU’s attractiveness as a hub for digital financial services, which will help make the union more attractive to new investors and innovations than the US.\n\nWhat investments will be required to meet these new standards?\n\nAdditional investment in governance and compliance structures is needed. Bigger, more well-established players may struggle to implement the required regulatory changes in their extensive processes and products. Those with existing compliance and governance processes will likely find the transition more seamless, while smaller fintechs may need to build these from scratch. The costs of their implementation present a potential hurdle.\n\nNavigating compliance is often a significant challenge for fintech startups and other smaller players. They’ll need to invest in knowledge, including how to correctly implement regulatory requirements into their processes and product designs, and translate these into operational business processes.\n\nOn top of this, investments in technology will need to be made as businesses must meet customer-facing requirements around transparency and language. For example, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will demand changes in know your customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring tools.\n\nHowever, compliance with the DORA regulatory framework is what will entail the biggest investment in technology, since digital operational resilience requires more robust security, backup, and testing methods. When working with partners who are fluent in compliance, the long-term payoff is clear.\n\nThe new finance model: Legacy institutions meet agile innovators\n\nNew technology has changed the way people interact with financial services, driving the growth of fintechs and increasing rivalry with established banks. One report found that 36% of 18-24-year-olds would choose fintech platforms over conventional financial institutions. Built on modern tech stacks and lean teams, fintechs’ agility allows them to react fast to changing consumer needs and market trends — a sharp contrast to the legacy infrastructure slowing down traditional banks.\n\nHowever, for both the old and new factions to succeed in Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape, traditional institutions and digital-native disruptors will need to depend on alliances. Effective partnerships between fintechs, banks, and FIs under the new EU regulations will be based on a mutual effort to enhance compliance, embrace innovation, and strengthen operational resilience. These collaborations are key for navigating complex regulations while delivering secure, innovative financial services.\n\nFintechs, FIs, customers, and merchants can also all benefit from Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships. For example, in the case of embedded lending, banks that partner with technology providers can scale quickly into new revenue opportunities, reaching new and existing customers outside of the direct scope of the bank, and thus try to keep pace with fintech competitors, without building their own technology in-house.\n\nIn fact, 41% of FIs have already implemented embedded finance solutions, and close to 50% have expanded their BaaS capabilities. Merchant customers then gain convenient, safe access to regulated, secure, innovative financial products from a trusted bank.\n\nAnother way that banks and fintechs can increase innovation while ensuring compliance is by engaging in collaborative models, including participation in regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments can support testing of new financial products and services under the supervision of regulators, providing a balance between innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe EU’s new wave of financial regulations isn’t just about tightening control — It’s part of a bigger push to simplify and unify rules across Europe. By uniforming patchwork national laws with consistent, EU-wide standards, compliance is now simpler to follow and predict. This uniformity and predictability can help encourage innovation while keeping consumer protection and financial stability front and centre. As fintech and banks collaborate, the future of digital finance in Europe is on track to be more open, safe, reliable, and inclusive.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"fintech\", \"fintechs\", \"regulatory\", \"better\", \"future\", \"compliance\", \"opinion\", \"europe\", \"banks\", \"way\", \"regulations\", \"digital\", \"financial\", \"eu\", \"regulate\", \"innovation\"]", "content_hash": "82915dce672f569d8b8d15c2f708b1453be1e0bcd65964d3688094326009eb6c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:19.958547+00:00"}

You’ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected — and sometimes disrespectful — judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?\n\nA pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and I’ve spent a decade doing casting for “Shark Tank” and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.\n\nI hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest — won by Dutch startup Tap Electric — captured what can make a founder’s story stand out. Whether you’re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:\n\nNerves\n\nYes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn’t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something — before, during, and after.\n\nEntrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.\n\nResearch\n\nA successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges’ backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can “do the most” with the funding or resources provided.\n\nDon’t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business\n\nWhatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.\n\nStart by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.\n\nLastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.\n\nWhat do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?\n\nAudience\n\nConnect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.\n\nInvite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links — all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.\n\nInternalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you’re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection – eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel — makes your message resonate.\n\nAsk\n\nYou would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.\n\nDon’t leave the most important part as a surprise — always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.\n\nIf the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.\n\nAs is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.\n\nContent\n\nA good pitch isn’t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.\n\nTreat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!\n\nRecord your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence “elevator pitch” and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.\n\nWrite a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience — what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained. Keep your community updated: this visibility can attract customers, partners, and even future investors. Leverage social media and other channels to amplify your story.\n\nA winning pitch is built on preparation, clarity, and connection. Research your judges, tell a crisp story, engage your audience, get specific about the resources and go-to-market strategy, make a confident and relevant ask, and then turn that one presentation into many pieces of compelling content.\n\nThese elements work together to make your pitch memorable and effective. A pitch including them can supercharge a business and accelerate your path towards growth.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"mean\", \"tank\", \"shark\", \"insider\", \"judges\", \"competition\", \"lessons\", \"audience\", \"business\", \"pro\", \"resources\", \"pitch\", \"ask\", \"market\", \"moment\"]", "content_hash": "ebc86269733a28b7dc25f62e5dd93c38b4258c905a1b9c024e49aee3ae02510c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:20.561091+00:00"}

Access to goods, services, and information not just for the few, but for everyone.\n\nVictoria Slivkoff, Head of Ecosystem at Walden Catalyst and Managing Director of Extreme Tech Challenge — a nonprofit uniting startups and VCs to accelerate progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — is excited for what lies ahead. In her view, the physical manifestation of AI could bring us closer to realising these ambitious goals.\n\n“Now we’re moving into the area of reasoning. AI is not just aggregating and organising information, it’s actually making predictions and drawing conclusions. How does that translate to the real world where robots can sense, learn, and interact with their surroundings?” she said to TNW founder Boris Veldhuijzen van Zaten in the latest episode of “Kia’s Next Big Drive.”\n\nWatch the full interview where Victoria and Boris discuss how we can leverage emerging technologies for positive global impact as they drive to TNW2025 in Kia’s 100% electric EV9 SUV.\n\nIn the not too distant future, we could be living in a world where robots are regularly navigating busy streets, offices, and classrooms. But as they become more common in our daily lives, is it them or us who will need to adapt most?\n\nRobots jumping the queue\n\nPicture this: you’re waiting for the elevator and a robot arrives at the same time. Who goes in first? If there’s only room for one, would you expect the robot to step aside, or would you treat it like a human and follow a “first come, first serve” approach?\n\nPast studies have found that most people expect service robots to be submissive, leading humans to prioritise themselves during conflicts, even in instances when a robot’s task was more urgent.\n\nWhat if a robot is carrying out a time specific task? The longer it waits until there are no humans in the queue, the longer it will take to complete it, whether it’s delivering a warm pizza or life saving medical supplies. So, how should robots navigate these social nuances without being ignored, undermined, or even bullied?\n\nThat’s what researchers aimed to find out last year in a study titled A Robot Jumping the Queue: Expectations About Politeness and Power During Conflicts in Everyday Human-Robot Encounters.\n\nThe researchers found that these robot-human interactions were more effective if participants expected an assertive robot which then asked politely for priority and entered first. But it’s not just robots that need to prepare to integrate into human society. The researchers highlighted that we may also need to rethink our attitudes and behaviours towards robots:\n\n“Should we maybe start thinking of service robots as having certain rights regarding priority if they fulfil human jobs with human responsibilities — or act as proxies for people? This might also help address the issue of robot bullying.”\n\nAs robots take on not only more responsibilities but also develop reason and sentience, at what point should we begin rethinking their social status?\n\nRobot teachers\n\nSocial robots — designed to communicate and interact with humans — are increasingly being used in caregiving, education, and mental health. In these settings, they help bridge service gaps, ease isolation, and offer emotional or learning support.\n\nUtrecht University of Applied Sciences is among those researching how robots can do more than just fill in; they can augment and enrich human-centred fields. For example:\n\nIn healthcare, how can robots be used to ease pre-procedure anxiety in children? Or help teach emotional skills for young patients who struggle with emotion regulation.\n\nAt last year’s Lowlands Science festival, the University showcased WOKEbot, a project exploring how a robot’s appearance and narrative voice (first vs. third person) influence human openness when discussing polarising topics.\n\n“Disagreements are timeless. People often manage to resolve them, but sometimes they simply can’t reach each other anymore. We saw this happen on a large scale not so long ago during the coronavirus pandemic. Are you for or against vaccination? When people dig in their heels and polarisation threatens, it can be helpful to have a neutral moderator,” said Dr. Mirjam de Haas. “The advantage of robots is that they are more neutral than humans. While you might be reserved with a person, a robot can make you more open and receptive to a different perspective.”\n\nAs part of her PhD research, Dr. Haas also conducted a number of successful experiments in using robotics to teach Dutch as a second language to students from linguistically diverse backgrounds. In her thesis defence, Dr. Haas explained that in the future, more and more students will fill classrooms. Having a robot aid will help facilitate learning for all students, including those with learning disabilities or those who are not yet fluent in Dutch.\n\nIs the world safe for robots?\n\nPerhaps the most recognisable robot in popular culture is The Terminator. In the first movie, a cyborg played by Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of humanity’s future leader. But, in the sequel, our villain returns with a new mission: to save humanity.\n\nThe SDGs were adopted by all UN members in 2015.

As sunshine bathes the leafy university campus, scientists inside the labs work under cool fluorescent light. Clad in green protective gear, they tend meticulously to test tubes within hermetically sealed cleanrooms. The containers hold the fruits of today’s labour: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).\n\nEach cell is barely a quarter the width of a human hair but wields remarkable power. MSCs reduce inflammation, repair damaged tissue, and modulate the immune system. They can treat chronic diseases and delay ageing. They may even prevent illness before it begins. But to become a mainstay of modern healthcare, MSCs must be produced at scale, affordably and reliably.\n\nThat seemed a distant prospect until recently, but the Karolinska scientists believe it’s approaching reality. They’re working for Cellcolabs, a Swedish startup formed to tackle the global scarcity of stem cell treatments.\n\nCellcolabs believes this shortage could soon be overcome. Thanks to a blend of scientific, regulatory, and technological advances, MSCs are edging towards the consumer market. Within the next decade, Cellcolabs aims to cut prices by up to 90%.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nIn the lab, the progress looks impressive. The latest harvest — cultivated from a single donation — has yielded 4.1 billion cells, enough for up to 200 standard doses.\n\nCellcolabs CEO Dr Mattias Bernow is in a buoyant mood. The 43-year-old sees today’s cultivation as just a taste of what’s to come.\n\n“I truly believe that we’re at an inflection point in the history of medicine,” he says.\n\nThe power of MSCs\n\nMSCs exist naturally in the body. A typical human contains billions of them. They act like a repair crew, fixing and tuning our insides. They can also be extracted, multiplied, and turned into medical treatments.\n\nKarolinska was the site of one of the field’s biggest milestones. In 2012, its Nobel Assembly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka. They discovered that mature cells can be made pluripotent — able to become almost any cell type in the body. The breakthrough rewrote the rules of regenerative medicine, igniting fresh regulatory momentum and fast-tracking stem cell therapies.\n\nMSCs are among the most promising examples. When injected, they release signals that trigger healing. The body then repairs itself.\n\nThey can treat countless conditions, from arthritis and heart disease to immune disorders. But first, you need to extract a small sample from a living, breathing human.\n\nCellcolabs sources its MSCs from the bone marrow of healthy donors aged 18 to 30. Just 50 millilitres — about a shot glass — produces up to 200 doses. The marrow naturally regenerates in six to eight weeks.\n\nThe donation process is quick and minimally invasive, but mass production is notoriously challenging. MSCs are living cells that require complex biomanufacturing, careful handling, and strict quality control, which makes scaling a formidable task.\n\nCellcolabs nonetheless sees industrial-scale production on the horizon — largely thanks to the pioneering research of Professor Katarina Le Blanc.\n\nLe Blanc’s landmark work showed MSCs could combat inflammatory and immune diseases. Her findings also proved that donated cells were suitable for therapeutic use — a crucial step for commercialisation.\n\nShe helped establish clinical-grade production standards, paving the way for large-scale trials and broader therapeutic use. Her research laid the foundations for Bernow’s inflection point.\n\n“This is not brain surgery or rocket science, but it is stem cells — so it’s quite close,” he says. “It’s super complex. And the only reason we can do this and move so fast is Professor Le Blanc’s research.”\n\nAs a haematologist, Le Blanc explored the potential of MSCs to support blood cancer patients. Her early clinical work focused on graft-versus-host disease — a severe and often fatal complication of bone marrow transplants. In a small trial, her team administered MSCs to patients who hadn’t responded to standard therapies. The impact was striking: more than half the participants survived. “The entire field just blew up,” says Bernow.\n\nLe Blanc continued pushing into new territory. One trial repaired vocal folds, restoring speech with minimal scarring. Another study used MSCs in COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation. The results were promising — but she hit a wall. “She ran out of cells,” Bernow says.\n\nScaling became a new focus. To expand treatment access, To expand treatment access, Le Blanc donated her research to Cellcolabs in 2021. Two years later, the Karolinska facility received production approval.\n\nProduction costs have fallen rapidly since then, fuelling hopes of a tenfold reduction. As prices drop and output scales, Bernow has his eyes on a target: “to truly democratise access to stem cells.”\n\nAfter spells as an ER physician, a consultant, and a startup founder, Mattias Bernow joined Cellcolabs in 2021. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nA new world of treatments\n\nBack in the lab, CPO Lina Sörvik leads a tour of the facilities. Previously a senior figure in big pharma, she joined Cellcolabs after being captivated by the potential of MSCs.\n\n“I was inspired by what they could do and by the idea of setting up a facility to produce them,” she says.\n\nOn a harvest day, her team’s work begins at 7:00 AM. Scientists don full protective gear and spend the day working inside the Karolinska cleanrooms. Once they’ve harvested the MSCs, the cells are tested for quality and frozen for future use.\n\nThe range of their applications is extensive. Middle-aged patients can gain relief from joint pain and injuries. Athletes can accelerate their recovery from injuries. The elderly could slow their ageing.\n\nBrian Johnson, a tech entrepreneur and celebrity longevity advocate, has also explored their powers. He had 300 million MSCs produced by Cellcolabs injected into his knees, shoulders, and hips.\n\nBernow lauds the variety of treatments. He says MSCs are interesting “for almost any indication.”\n\nHis path to them was winding. Raised in Malmö, southwestern Sweden, Bernow moved to the country’s capital to study at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE).\n\n“At that time, everybody wanted to become bankers in London,” he recalls. “That was not the future I saw for myself.”\n\nHe expanded his studies, earning a medical degree from Karolinska Institute and an MSc from SSE. After working as a clinical physician and management consultant, he co-founded Doctrin, a digital healthcare platform. Then Cellcolabs came calling: the leadership team needed a CEO and saw Bernow as a perfect fit.\n\n“I knew it was going to be more blood, sweat, and tears,” he says. “But the more I read, the more fascinated I became.”\n\nWhat fascinated him the most was the potential of MSCs to treat chronic conditions — the leading cause of death in the world. “That is why I think we’re truly at an inflection point in the history of medicine.”\n\nThe new antibiotics?\n\nBernow likes to share a quote from Joseph Martin, former Dean of Harvard Medical School: “Stem cell therapies have the potential to do for chronic diseases what antibiotics did for infectious diseases.”\n\nIt’s a bold comparison. Before Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, minor infections could be fatal. Healthy people died young or quickly aged.\n\nA century later, antibiotics let us live longer, better lives. Infectious diseases are no longer the leading causes of death. They’ve been supplanted by chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes. We’re also now living with more age-related illnesses, which severely reduce quality of life.\n\nMSCs, Bernow says, can help alleviate the growing burden of chronic illness. “But as a physician, what I find most interesting is the potential to prevent — or at least delay — the onset of disease.”\n\nHe recalls his time working in the ER, treating cardiac patients. A typical case was a middle-aged man who had just suffered his first cardiac event, now resigned to a lower quality and potentially shorter life. MSCs could have transformed that outcome.\n\nTheir regenerative and anti-inflammatory powers could support recovery — or even prevent the event altogether.\n\nTo reach this potential, Cellcolabs is targeting a new launchpad for scale: bioreactors.\n\nScaling for the future\n\nInside the Karolinska cleanrooms, Cellcolabs currently grows MSCs on flat surfaces in cell medium. Bioreactors offer a promising upgrade.\n\nBy vastly expanding cultivation surfaces and enabling automated, tightly controlled growth conditions, they could scale production far beyond what’s feasible with today’s methods.\n\nBioreactors could replace many of the manual methods currently used inside the cleanrooms. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nCellcolabs is developing its bioreactor platform with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Bernow expects it to transform production, multiplying MSC output many times over.\n\nFull-scale launch is slated for 2028. By then, Cellcolabs also hopes to have compelling new evidence for the benefits of MSCs.\n\nThe startup is currently involved in promising tests in the Bahamas and Abu Dhabi. Both locations have created progressive, patient-friendly, and ethically regulated frameworks for MSC trials, which have made them industry trailblazers.\n\nAcross their test sites, scientists are investigating treatments for a variety of conditions: musculoskeletal injuries, knee osteoarthritis, cardiovascular risk, arthritis, and age-related frailty.\n\nIn smaller territories such as these, it’s easier to update medical regulations for emerging therapies. If they’re successful, Bernow expects other nations to follow their lead and accelerate their support for MSCs. The potential benefits, he argues, are enormous.\n\nHe envisions the tiny cells shifting healthcare systems from reactive to preventative, cutting costs while tackling chronic conditions. Our lives wouldn’t just grow longer — they’d be healthier and happier.\n\nBernow draws a contrast with recent advances in Western medicine. We live longer, but our later years are often marred by frailty, illness, and a confined existence.\n\n“We’ve added years with lower life quality,” he says. “If stem cells can delay chronic disease onset, we can start prolonging our healthy lifespan.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean, he adds, that MSCs will create a fountain of youth. They won’t expand our lives forever, but they dramatically improve the time we have.\n\n“I want to spend the first 100 years being highly active and with my family — with my children, my grandchildren, and maybe even my great great grandchildren.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"karolinska\", \"conditions\", \"medicine\", \"point\", \"startup\", \"bernow\", \"stem\", \"proclaims\", \"mass\", \"potential\", \"cell\", \"inflection\", \"cells\", \"production\", \"cellcolabs\", \"chronic\", \"nears\", \"mscs\"]", "content_hash": "dd2308db432021a3bafbae98355a42723558f3b60fb80576193317aa296684bc", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:21.773303+00:00"}

Or seismic activity sensors built for construction that go on to detect submarines underwater. These ideas represent the promise of dual-use technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes. For the first time, the European Commission is explicitly proposing to fund them through programmes such as Horizon Europe. But as we race to embrace dual-use technologies, we face a pivotal choice: continue the old model where military applications drive innovation that civilians later adopt, or turn this paradigm on its head?\n\nTechnological innovation has long followed a well-trodden path: the military drives development, with civilian applications emerging as an afterthought. Consider GPS, arguably one of the most successful dual-use technologies in history. Originally developed by the US Department of Defence in the 1970s, it was designed for military positioning and navigation. Civilian access was restricted by “Selective Availability” — a feature that intentionally degraded accuracy to preserve the military’s advantage.\n\nThe full potential of GPS remained unrealised for decades until the deactivation of Selective Availability in 2000, instantly making it 10 times more accurate for civilian users. It quickly became a technology that most of us rely on every day, sparking innovations that transformed industries from agriculture to transportation. A 2019 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that GPS had generated $1.4 trillion in economic benefits.\n\nThis military-first approach, as we’ve seen with GPS, has dominated innovation funding for decades. Yet there’s compelling evidence that civilian-first approaches to dual-use technologies both better serve society’s immediate needs and ultimately produce more robust solutions for all applications — including military ones.\n\nThe traditional model overlooks a critical reality: civilian markets provide both scale and diversity of applications that drive innovation in ways the more specialised military sector cannot match. This pattern repeats across technological domains. Internet protocols developed for military communications found their greatest evolution in civilian applications, before returning to enhance military systems. The commercial drone industry has accelerated aerial innovation far beyond what military procurement alone could achieve.\n\nBy focusing on civilian-first use cases, innovation can leverage larger markets, more diverse applications, and faster development cycles. When technologies are developed with broad civilian applications in mind, they benefit from economies of scale that military-only development cannot achieve.\n\nThis is in part because civilian innovation faces fewer bureaucratic constraints. Military procurement cycles can span years or even decades, while civilian markets reward agility and rapid iteration. Developing for civilian use first allows technologies to evolve and mature faster than would be possible under traditional defence procurement timelines.\n\nThe most promising dual-use breakthroughs come from tackling fundamental technical challenges rather than specific operational functions. When innovators focus narrowly on military operations, they often miss the broader potential of their technologies. Scientific potential isn’t abstract; it only becomes real through implementation.\n\nThe challenge of developing robust navigation systems that work without GPS is a perfect example. A solution that enables delivery drones to navigate urban environments reliably could revolutionise logistics while simultaneously providing capabilities critical for defence operations. By emphasising civilian applications while acknowledging potential military uses, we create space for innovations that might otherwise never emerge.\n\nResearch from the European Commission on introducing a military tech aspect to the successor to Horizon Europe found that academic and research institutions would prefer to stick to the status quo, and keep Europe’s R&D funding solely for civilian technologies. By providing funding pathways that respect these preferences, we expand the talent pool, addressing critical technological challenges. Given the financial strains and political pressures in US higher education, Europe could attract top innovators from across the Atlantic by creating an environment aligned with their core values.\n\nAs Europe intensifies its focus on strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty, dual-use technologies will play an increasingly important role. The EU’s recent moves to allow dual-use funding through programs such as Horizon Europe represent an important shift in how we approach innovation. But as these initiatives take shape, they must avoid simply replicating the traditional military-first model.\n\nBy prioritising civilian use cases while acknowledging military applications, we can leverage market forces, attract diverse talent, and produce more robust technologies for all applications.\n\nYet for dual-use development to be truly durable, civilian and military technologies must no longer be siloed – we have to bridge the gap between civilian first R&D and military use cases. Given the chasm that exists between the way these two sectors operate, this will need to be an active process. Initiating more open knowledge exchange would better apply insights and learnings from both worlds back and forth. For bodies that focus on military technology, it is time to incubate a civilian equivalent. Conversely, organisations like mine — SPRIND, the German federal agency for disruptive innovation — focused on civilian technology, should also explore military applications.\n\nThe challenges we face — from climate change and energy security to supply chain resilience — require technological solutions that serve multiple purposes. The old dichotomy between civilian and military innovation is increasingly outdated in a world where the most powerful technologies inevitably serve both domains.

But he’s begun to wonder if candidates’ answers are genuine, even on video calls. “I can see their eyes shifting across the screen,” he says. “Then they come back with the perfect answer to a question.” The trust gap between employer and jobseeker is widening, and it’s fast becoming one of the trickiest knots in modern hiring.\n\n\n\nFrom ChatGPT-polished CVs to full-blown applications submitted by bots, GenAI has hit the job market hard and gone fully mainstream. For a sizable generation of jobseekers — 68% of European tech workers were actively looking for a new role at the end of 2024 — it’s commonplace to use AI to tweak a CV or even complete an entire application.\n\n\n\nTools like Sonara, LazyApply, and JobCopilot have made it easy to shoot off dozens of applications in a day. In June, data from TestGorilla found that just over a third (37%) of UK jobseekers are using AI to complete applications. Among early-career candidates, it jumps to 60%, up from 38% the year before, according to Bright Network, which connects graduates and young professionals with recruiters.\n\nStartups are at the forefront of this AI arms race. With smaller teams, shorter runways, and a culture of speed, they’re particularly exposed to this strange new world of suspiciously shiny applicants and AI-assisted code challenges. Most aren’t fighting it: 85% of employers now actively accept AI-assisted applications. But their acceptance doesn’t equal apathy. Amid a deluge of blatant AI use, how are Europe’s most agile companies working out who’s being real — and if they’re worth bringing onboard?\n\nA new normal\n\nUsing AI to troubleshoot and tailor a CV has become par for the course. For most jobseekers, GenAI acts like a digital sidekick — smoothing grammar, sharpening phrasing, and cranking out tailored applications faster than ever. According to Canva’s January survey of 5,000 employees across countries including the UK, France, Spain, and Germany, 45% had used GenAI to build or improve a resume — and have yielded positive results. But hiring managers aren’t entirely sold. In the UK, 63% believe candidates should disclose if AI played a role in their application materials, signifying that trust is on shaky ground.\n\nOther research suggests that attitudes depend on the context. A global survey by Experis (part of workforce giant ManpowerGroup) found that 28% of tech leaders are fine with AI if used to personalise a resume or cover letter, 26% with help on problem-solving tests, and 24% even with answering interview questions. Just 15% said AI use is unacceptable across the entire job application process.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Sign up now!\n\nFor Duco van Lanschot, co-founder of fintech startup Duna, it’s all about the role. “If an engineer used ChatGPT to polish a written application, fine. That’s not the job. But for a growth or sales hire to use it very obviously is a big red flag,” he says. “The job itself involves public-facing comms and emailing stakeholders — and in a sea of generic, AI-generated copy, I want us to be as human as possible.”\n\nTech employers and startups are adapting — albeit in different ways and at different speeds. Some are setting ground rules for usage, some are bulking out human-only processes, and some are cutting away entire parts of the “traditional” hiring approach. “AI hasn’t broken hiring,” says Marija Marcenko, Head of Global Talent Acquisition at SaaS platform Semrush. “But it’s changed how we engage with candidates.”\n\nGoodbye to CVs\n\nIn the words of Khyati Sundaram, ethical AI hiring expert and CEO of Applied, we’re in the middle of “an AI-on-AI war.” And in the fallout, traditional application materials are losing their sway. In the tech sector, cover letters fell into obsolescence long ago, and CVs are next on the chopping block. “A huge upside is that it’s exposing résumés for what they are — a broken artefact,” says Sundaram, whose team works with the likes of Unicef UK, BLab, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. “Putting résumés into keyword scanners or GenAI tools isn’t solving the problem for those hiring, because when it comes to the interview, the candidate falls apart,” she explains.\n\nInstead of cover letters and cut-and-paste CVs, employers are turning to structured questionnaires and skill-based tasks — tools that measure how someone thinks, not just how well they can write a prompt. “Skill-based hiring is no longer just a tech hiring thing,” Sundaram adds. “We’re seeing that crop up in more white-collar roles across the board.” According to TestGorilla, 77% of UK employers now use skills tests to evaluate candidates, with the same proportion saying these tests outperform CVs in predicting job success. This should have a positive effect in the long term: LinkedIn’s Economic Graph Institute found that a skills-based approach globally could expand talent pools by 6.1x, and help broaden gender and minority representation.\n\nAt Semrush, the shakeup is already in full swing. Hiring managers are trained to sniff out fluency without depth, spotting signs of AI in real-time coding challenges or task-based interviews. “We’ve replaced the usual ‘Tell me about yourself’ prompts with in-depth interviews that explore experience, soft skills, and thinking patterns,” says Marcenko. “It’s hard to fake those, with or without AI.”\n\n\n\nApplied’s own system uses a mix of automation and human insight. “We don’t believe in AI detectors — they’re rarely accurate, so we train reviewers to pattern match like an AI, comparing submissions to known GPT outputs,” explains Sundaram. “If five responses sound suspiciously identical, humans can flag them.”\n\nElsewhere, startups are getting more creative and more human. Alessandro Bonati, Chief People Officer at travel scaleup WeRoad, has ditched cover letters in favour of more creative, human-centric formats like curated portfolios or briefs of the “show, don’t tell” type. The company, which has over 210 staff in offices across Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, actively encourages candidates to use AI. “But that’s also accompanied by traditional in-person interviews to assess candidates’ thinking, communication, and cultural fit in real time,” says Bonati. His team also leans on real-time scenario-based exercises that reflect how candidates would collaborate, not just how well they can prepare.\n\nThe return of the reference and in-person interviews\n\nAnother ripple effect: references are back on the menu. Santiago Nestares, co-founder of the accounting startup DualEntry, is spending more time face-to-face on Zoom with candidates. “Experience is hard to fake,” says Nestares. “You can usually tell when someone’s just read about something versus having lived it.” He’s also going deeper on references; not just the usual ones, as those are always glowing, but backchannel conversations with people who’ve worked with them directly. “It’s so we can find out how someone handles pressure, works with a team, and shows up day to day,” says Nestares.\n\nThrough building the team for Connectd, a platform which enables angel investors and founders to effectively manage their startups, Samuel has noticed that candidates are cutting through the lack of trust by building more social proof around themselves. “For hiring managers, instead of taking a candidate’s word for it, we’re diving into references more than ever,” he says.\n\nThe dreaded take-home task is on the way out now too. Unpaid and time-consuming, candidates have long despised them, and now that there’s the option of using GenAI to fake it (until they make it), employers are souring on them too. Live interviews, technical walk-throughs, scenario-based challenges, and even roleplay simulations are becoming the new standard, particularly in product, design, and marketing roles. “AI detectors are being used,” says Andreas Bundi, founder of Berlin-based HR consultancy Bundls. “But most companies are asking — why bother with take-homes when you can just do a live assessment?”\n\n\n\nBundi, who works with clients like Pitch, Cradle and Telli, says hybrid companies with mandatory office days are ditching take-homes to keep the interview process aligned with on-site work. With more candidates on the market, jobseekers are going further — relocating, or even flying in for interviews.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, well-funded companies are increasingly comfortable bringing people on-site for tasks. “When travel isn’t possible, I’ve arranged in-person meetings with interviewers who happen to be nearby,” says Bundi. “I recently scheduled interviews around a conference both the candidate and interviewer were attending.” This “networking meets hiring approach” works surprisingly well.\n\nBundi says he sees that it’s the AI-first companies that are more relaxed about candidates using tools like ChatGPT — but it’s rarely made explicit. Recently, one of his Lead Data Scientists blew an interview by manually wrangling messy data instead of automating it. “They thought they needed to demonstrate their raw coding skills,” says Bundi. “But the company wanted strategy, not a human data janitor. That’s what ChatGPT is for.” As AI becomes standard, candidates and companies will need to get clearer on where it fits in the process. Until then, these frictions will continue.\n\nHire for skills and values, not a job description\n\nDespite the ubiquity of AI-powered applications, most companies still haven’t formalised their approach. “It’s confusing for candidates, as some companies don’t want AI used in applications, even though those same roles involve AI tools every day,” says Sundaram. Indeed, 40% of employers using BrightNetwork services said they still haven’t set guidelines for AI usage in their processes, although 28% plan to for the next recruitment season. Of those who have set guidelines, 44% don’t allow candidates to use AI.\n\n\n\n“The vanguard employers want everyone to use it and demonstrate their AI literacy,” says Sundaram. Some of Applied’s clients have even added the question: ‘How will you use AI in this job?’ She warns, however, that many of the quick fixes employers reach for — AI detectors, video screening with facial tracking, voice sentiment tools — raise huge ethical concerns. “If companies are tracking facial expressions for emotional nuance, it gets creepy,” she says. “Where do we draw the line?”\n\n\n\nInstead, she argues, the fix will lie in redefining what candidates are being tested for. Applied has shifted from traditional job architecture to task architecture, evaluating not just skills, but values like resilience, adaptability, and mission alignment. “These are the human traits that will matter even more as jobs evolve,” she says. “Especially in startups, where everyone’s a generalist.”\n\nWithout doubt, generative AI is fundamentally reshaping the hiring process. The most forward-looking startups aren’t resisting the change — they’re building better processes around it. CVs may be broken, cover letters outdated, and applications increasingly synthetic — but the real differentiator is still very human. “We need people who can adapt, not just apply,” says Sundaram. “Because the job they’re hired for today may not exist in six months.” Startups that understand this and structure their hiring accordingly aren’t just future-proofing their teams, they’re rewriting the rules of work for the AI era.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"playbook\", \"rewriting\", \"ai\", \"job\", \"aionai\", \"candidates\", \"sundaram\", \"war\", \"companies\", \"theyre\", \"recruitment\", \"applications\", \"employers\", \"human\", \"hiring\"]", "content_hash": "a4f6b086bdd4bcd929bb2ca4696119aa3ef3cfbb6a6037db5f55c2e5b18487ea", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:23.003024+00:00"}
{"url": "https://thenextweb.com/news/europe-humanoid-robotics-strategy", "title": "Why Europe could quietly win the humanoid race", "authors": "[\"Artem Sokolov\", \"Story By\"]", "published": "2025-08-04T07:39:30+00:00", "text": "Elon Musk’s Optimus demo at Tesla’s We Robot event made one thing clear: when it comes to humanoids, the spotlight still belongs to the United States. Then there is Asia — with China’s rapid developments and Japan and South Korea’s deep legacy in robotics. Headlines still gravitate toward billion-dollar budgets, rapid hardware iterations, and slick simulation reels.\n\nBehind the noise, though, another development is unfolding in Europe — quieter, but potentially far more consequential. The next chapter of humanoid robotics may be defined not by who moves first or builds the flashiest prototypes, but by who moves with the discipline and consistency required. And Europe has the potential to lead this new era.\n\nRegulation as strategy\n\nIn most conversations about innovation, regulation is framed as a brake. In Silicon Valley, it’s often seen as a hurdle to scale or a signal of bureaucratic overreach. But Europe — particularly in AI and robotics — is rewriting that narrative. With the AI Act now adopted, the EU is the first region to offer comprehensive legal clarity around the deployment of high-risk AI systems, including humanoid robots.\n\nWe must also consider that, eventually, other countries will likely adopt regulatory frameworks that align broadly with the EU’s, even if they’re less stringent. By designing with European standards from the outset, we’ll be well-positioned to adapt quickly as new regulations emerge elsewhere.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nThis clarity matters. When investors and industrial partners can reliably assess compliance risks, they’re most likely to commit resources. In a field as complex and potentially disruptive as robotics, clear rules don’t slow down progress — they de-risk it.\n\nEurope has also introduced or updated several other regulations that directly impact robotics:\n\nThe Product Liability Directive now includes software and AI, reducing ambiguity and incentivising safer design practices.\n\nThe General Product Safety Regulation streamlines cross-border market entry with harmonised safety standards.\n\nThe Machinery Regulation defines clearer certification routes for robotic systems.\n\nTogether, these frameworks give the EU a coherent and predictable regulatory environment. Yes, it’s tough, but given the implications, this provides exactly what the humanoid sector needs: clarity.\n\nDeployment, not demos\n\nWhile the US often relies on innovation funded by Big Tech monopolies and China leans on state-driven manufacturing strategies, Europe’s robotics sector is built on modular collaboration. Startups and research labs spin out into well-funded clusters, often supported by EU-backed initiatives like RI4EU and EIC Accelerator. These programs offer access to testbeds, pilot funding, and collaborative R&D networks.\n\nFurthermore, Europe’s geographic and industrial structure gives it a special advantage: close proximity to real-world use cases. Having neighbouring logistics hubs, manufacturing zones, and retail chains in contiguity helps speed iteration and aligns development with the continent’s actual operational pain points. McKinsey estimates that in some of Europe’s critical sectors — including retail and logistics — payroll alone amounts to $1.7 trillion (€1.55 trillion). This makes automation highly profitable and ripe for disruption.\n\nThese factors have played a key role in the strategy of Humanoid, the robotics company I founded in the UK last year. Our goal isn’t just to impress on stage; it’s far more important that we seamlessly integrate innovations into real workflows. For this, we’ve adopted a simple, modular design philosophy: a wheeled base that suits logistics environments, accelerated by simulation plus feedback from real industry trials. We believe that hype must be based on reality — a mindset that’s drawing US investors to European robotics.\n\nThis shift is already reflected in funding dynamics. Neura Robotics’ €120mn funding round in January 2025 was one of the largest in European robotics to date. And investors are now betting on full-stack teams with credible deployment strategies — instead of merely speculative tech.\n\nHumanoid’s latest robot, HMND 01, was introduced in a video earlier this year. Credit: Humanoid\n\nA better fit for the future of work\n\nBeyond reducing uncertainty, European regulation also helps encode values that shape how humanoid robots are developed and deployed. The AI Act requires high-risk systems — including those used in workplaces, public spaces, and healthcare settings — to meet strict safety, transparency, and human oversight standards.\n\nSuch a framework fosters trust, which is essential for robots operating in sensitive environments like factories, hospitals, or elderly care facilities. Europe’s emphasis on traceability and ethical co-development goes beyond mitigating risk — it creates the conditions for adoption at scale, where safety and dignity are non-negotiable.\n\nAdditionally, this approach helps position robots as partners. By designing for augmentation rather than displacement — as often seen in the US — European startups are modelling a more human-centred approach to automation. They’re also offering an alternative to the dominant narrative that robots will replace humans in critical roles.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that some jobs aren’t meant for people, as they hinder individuals from reaching their full potential. For instance, a humanoid could take over the task of moving boxes around a warehouse all day. This is not simply a replacement; it is an augmentation of existing automation capabilities, which empowers people to find more purpose-driven work.\n\nThat distinction comes into sharper focus when we look at the places where humanoids are most needed, such as logistics hubs, clinics, and care homes. These environments have real spatial and regulatory constraints and little room for error. The tasks there are repetitive but require precision, and people are extremely busy. In these settings, robots need to quietly support the flow of work, not interrupt it. That requires thoughtful integration, which means responding at the right pace, handling objects predictably, and, yes, staying out of the way when needed.\n\nThese are practical challenges shaped by day-to-day routines, not only engineering feats. And, from our vantage point, Europe’s cautious, user-informed development model is well-suited to meet them.\n\nSupply chains and strategic independence\n\nThere are still concerns in European robotics that need to be addressed. As of 2025, China controls 63% of the humanoid hardware supply chain, from rare-earth magnets to key actuators. However, we’re now seeing global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) based in Europe partnering with humanoid creators early on to co-develop hardware components together. This strategy can mitigate the risk of over-dependence.\n\nOn the other hand, while the US dominates in AI software, few actors globally offer fully-integrated stacks. We see some moves in that direction in the US and China, and Europe — which is still dependent on imports — must learn to navigate this space assertively.\n\nCalls for supply diversification are growing. In June 2025, Benjamin Krieger, from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA), emphasised the need for stronger EU supply chain routes due to China’s export controls on rare-earth elements. In the US, analysts are sounding similar alarms.\n\nTo reduce dependency, Europe will need to support local manufacturing of key components, incentivise alternative sourcing, and form trade alliances outside Beijing’s orbit.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe next phase of humanoid robotics will not be won by whoever moves fastest. It will be won by whoever builds best.\n\nWhat will this require? To start, bolstering funding and support mechanisms that help innovations advance through the later stages of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale — and move from pilots to industrial-grade rollouts. Second, forging industrial partnerships that begin during prototyping, not after. Third, policy agility to fast-track certification while maintaining the highest safety standards.\n\nWhat’s at stake isn’t just who secures the most patents — we’ve already seen that happen without meaningful real-world deployment. The true challenge is whether we can build systems that integrate safely into human environments, uphold public trust, and address the real concerns people have — from privacy and transparency to everyday safety and interaction.\n\nEurope doesn’t need to mimic Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Instead, it needs to double down on what it already does well: interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical tech design, and industrial pragmatism.\n\nThe global humanoid race is not a sprint — it’s a long-term infrastructure project. And if we get it right, Europe could build the future’s most trusted workforce —- one that collaborates with humans and changes the world, one robot at a time.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"need\", \"robots\", \"ai\", \"europe\", \"race\", \"european\", \"safety\", \"europes\", \"robotics\", \"eu\", \"humanoid\", \"win\", \"quietly\"]", "content_hash": "8029ef43a1e99617e17b64c4dd64eba16fadbfd6d11ad701563f5949b3ab9754", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:23.624794+00:00"}

The Data Protection Act, the GDPR, and the recent AI Act — aligned more closely with local workers’ laws and unions — have set the continent on a separate path.\n\nA recent joint study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Poland’s National Research Institute (NASK) found that Europe — along with Asia — tops the list of most exposed regions to AI, far surpassing the Americas. With studies finding that one in four jobs are at risk of being transformed by AI globally, the impact in Europe — a region which faces a significant shortage of skilled workers — has become a pressing concern.\n\n“In many ways, it’s too early to tell where the AI wave will take us — we’ve only seen a fraction of its capabilities so far, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying,” Adam Maurer, COO at Connecting Software, a tech company operating across Europe, told TNW.\n\nIn recent years, Big Tech companies have frequently carried out mass layoffs, driven both by revenue concerns and the belief that AI can take over many of the functions of employees from entry to mid-level, Maurer said.\n\nSome of these AI-driven layoffs have effectively targeted low performers, but other initiatives have been problematic. At Klarna, for example, they had concerning impacts on the business.\n\nKlarna, a Swedish fintech company that fired 700 workers and replaced them with AI, recently announced it will hire humans back again. The company’s CEO admitted to having made a “mistake” when replacing workers with AI.\n\n“It’s very clear that AI will definitely replace some jobs,” Maurer said. “On the other side of the coin, I think it will make some other jobs far more valuable.”\n\nIn the EU, labour laws and regulations will shape the impact on jobs. Tech leaders believe they could lead to an AI future that benefits both workers and businesses.\n\nThe talk among executives\n\nMaurer said there may be some expectation for the EU to step in and regulate job displacement. However, he argued that would stagnate growth and discourage startups from doing business in the union.\n\nBut not every business leader agrees. Displacement will happen, but not because of AI, said Volodymyr Kubytskyi, head of AI at MacPaw, a Ukrainian software company developing solutions for Apple devices.\n\n“AI disrupts the traditional logic and processes of work,” Kubytskyi told TNW. “The real question is, ‘Can we redesign work processes before this outdated system collapses?’” To prevent the system from collapsing, leaders must stop thinking of AI as a quick-win or cost-saving tool, he said.\n\nKubytskyi argued that while the AI Act was necessary to set a baseline for the industry, it doesn’t account for potential job disruption, which is a gap in the regulatory landscape.\n\n“To account for this, the AI Act should be updated, but it’s unlikely that this will happen soon,” he said.\n\nRoman Eloshvili, founder of ComplyControl, a UK compliance company, told TNW that the AI Act targets safety, transparency, and ethics, but falls short on socio-economic impact, especially on jobs. “So, amendments are necessary,” he said.\n\n“I expect that, over time, some of them, such as mandates for employer-led upskilling or protections for displaced workers, will appear to address workforce implications more effectively.”\n\nWill the AI Act become outdated or even counterproductive, especially if its stringent compliance mechanisms amplify inequalities in access to AI benefits? Or is it too early in the game to amend the law?\n\nKris Jones, who leads the engineering team in Belfast for iVerify, believes it’s too soon to make changes. He said the AI Act’s risk-based framework already strikes a delicate balance between protecting fundamental rights and giving innovators room to breathe.\n\nAmending the regulation is not the only policy idea discussed among executives. Jones told TNW that member states have other levers to pull. “One idea floating around is an ‘AI token’ tax,” he said.\n\nA token tax would enable governments to generate revenue from AI usage that is producing income. These funds would then be redistributed through measures such as reskilling programs or support for affected industries.\n\nDario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, recently told Axios that the concept could offset the inevitable wipeout of millions of entry-level white-collar jobs lost to AI.\n\n“Measures like that can cushion any job shocks without putting a blanket lid on innovation,” Amodei said.\n\nAre clashes with European labour and trade unions inevitable?\n\nEuropean labour and trade union bodies have often been ignored in the debate over AI job displacement. But many of them have already made official statements expressing concerns over AI.\n\nAhead of the Paris AI Summit in February 2025, the ETUC, representing over 45 million European workers, issued an open letter about AI’s dangers. It warned that any efforts to ensure AI has “a positive impact on workers in the labour markets, quality jobs, and society will be annulled if AI is monopolised by a handful of tech companies”.\n\nThe previous August, UK unions, including Accord and Unite, had called for regulations to protect workers from AI. They also proposed reskilling programs for workers, reminded companies of their transparency obligations, and emphasised the need for union consultations. They said that they intended to protect workers’ rights against AI‑driven hiring and firing, as well as defend IP rights for creative professionals.\n\nWe asked tech firms whether they expect companies to face challenges with labour laws and unions in Europe.\n\n“Undoubtedly,” Eloshvili from ComplyControl said. “European robust worker protections and active unions present both a safeguard and challenges for AI integration.”\n\nUnions will demand transparency and worker involvement in AI deployment as automation threatens certain jobs, he said. “Firms that try to impose AI solutions without dialogue definitely risk conflict and backlash.”\n\nDespite the challenges, Eloshvili said it isn’t a zero-sum game. “When businesses and unions work together — for example, under joint upskilling initiatives — AI can become an effective tool for improving working conditions,” he said.\n\nKubytskyi from MacPaw agreed that challenges will arise on this front and described the pushback from unions and workers’ organisations as “understandable”.\n\n“Clarity, structure, and communication are vital,” he said. “If you integrate new [AI] agents into existing workflows without involving people, you’ll get pushback, and for a good reason.”\n\nKubytskyi also believes that conflict can be avoided. “To prevent this, we need to show people what AI does, what guardrails are in place, and why it will benefit the team.”\n\nJorge Riera, the CEO of big data and AI consultancy Dataco, agrees. “The most effective AI deployments are strategic,” he said, adding that careful analysis is needed to decipher which work tasks should be offloaded to AI.\n\nFlipping the script to develop AI the ‘European way’\n\nJones from iVerify explained that regulations, trade unions, and workers’ rights in Europe are not necessarily an obstacle and could, in fact, be beneficial.\n\nHe believes companies should embed responsible AI, bias checks, explainability, and human oversight loops into each product cycle. That way, they can transform the AI Act from a compliance hurdle into a market differentiator, Jones explained.\n\n“Europe can’t sit out the AI wave; the Bay Area now fields roughly half of the world’s unicorns and hoovers up 80% of GenAI funding, while much of the European workforce is ageing and a quarter of young Europeans can’t find work,” Jones said.\n\nEurope is not only facing competition from the usual suspects — Asia and the US — but also from Latin America, where heavy investment in technology is underway.\n\nMahesh Raja, chief growth officer of Ness Digital Engineering, which operates innovation centres in the UK and Czechia, highlighted how this lack of similar investment is hurting business. “Fifty-three percent of small- and medium-size businesses found the initial cost of AI implementation to be much higher than anticipated. We need to address the adoption challenges that stem from legacy IT infrastructures and improve the collective time-to-value for this emerging technology,” he said.\n\nHowever, Europe’s stringent regulations can become a premium brand for banks, healthtechs, and any sector that values trust and data privacy.\n\n”Europe shouldn’t just photocopy Silicon Valley,” Jones said. He believes the continent’s strengths lie in a combination of factors, including upskilling and STEM PhD graduates per capita. The privacy-first and safe AI leadership — solidified in regulation — can bolster the package.\n\n“Overall, Europe should push hard on AI augmentation and skill-building, or we’ll fall further behind,” Jones said. “But do it Europe’s way, leveraging our ethical governance, deep industrial know-how, and cross-border talent pipelines instead of importing the Valley’s blitz-and-break culture wholesale.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"work\", \"act\", \"ai\", \"workers\", \"europe\", \"stifling\", \"unions\", \"jobs\", \"told\", \"protect\", \"eus\", \"labour\", \"jones\", \"innovation\"]", "content_hash": "d5d63c25b67f85daae93803735f2880db3af5f7910d11a2d0bcb679009816f51", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:24.219917+00:00"}

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "The Oura Ring 4 (left) has receded sensors that make it more comfortable compared to Oura Ring 3 (right). Nina Raemont/ZDNET\n\nConsidering buying an Oura Ring to track your sleep, activity, or stress? Oura is taking up to $200 off its third-gen smart ring, depending on the finish and size. This deal applies to the Oura Ring Heritage and Oura Ring Horizon, two third-generation smart rings.\n\nAlso: The Oura Ring 4 is ZDNET's best product of the year\n\nThe deal on the earlier generation Oura Ring 3 is so low because Oura recently unveiled the Oura Ring 4. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive and well-designed smart ring that blows its competitors (and even the Ring 3) out of the water. But does that mean you should buy the newer Ring 4 over the less expensive Ring 3 that's on sale right now? It all depends on what features you prioritize in a smart ring. I break down the differences below.\n\nSpecifications\n\n\n\nOura Ring 3 Oura Ring 4 Battery life Up to seven days Up to eight days Charging time Between 20-80 minutes Between 20-80 minutes Sizes 6-13 4-15 Material Titanium exterior and epoxy interior Fully titanium Finishes Black, brushed titanium, gold, silver, rose gold Black, brushed silver, gold, silver, rose gold Starting price $300 $350\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 4 if...\n\n\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You prioritize comfort\n\nOne of the highlights of the new Oura Ring 4 is its smart sensors. Oura Ring 4's smart sensing technology uses 18 signal pathways, compared to the Oura Ring 3's eight, to capture more accurate data with fewer gaps.\n\nSo, what does that have to do with comfort? These smart sensors allow the raised sensor domes that stick out on the Oura Ring 3's interior to flatten and recede on the Oura Ring 4 for a more comfortable and less constrictive wear. I wore the Oura Ring 3 for around eight months, and one of the few gripes I had with it was that the three domes would cling to the inside of my finger, resulting in dents that remained on my skin for days after.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 4 for weeks. Here's why it's the best health tracker right now\n\nThe Oura Ring 4 is far more comfortable than the Oura Ring 3 thanks to the receded smart sensing technology. It's noticeably slimmer, both on the interior of the ring and the exterior, which results in a lighter feel. If you are more sensitive to health trackers around your wrist or finger and get easily annoyed with jewelry, I'd suggest the Oura Ring 4.\n\n2. You want a smaller or larger ring size\n\nSherin Shibu\n\nExpanded sizing is one of the major hardware upgrades that came with the Oura Ring 4. Where the Oura Ring 3 offers sizes six through 13, the Oura Ring 4 offers sizes four through 15. That's four more sizes on the larger and smaller ends of the spectrum. If you couldn't buy the Oura Ring 3 because the available sizes didn't fit your finger, the Oura Ring 4 might fit you better.\n\n3. You want a longer battery life\n\nThe Oura Ring 3 boasts a battery life of up to seven days, though I normally got around four. The newer Oura Ring 4 boasts a battery life of up to eight days, but during my testing I got around 5 and a half.\n\nIf you forget to charge your tech constantly and want a smart ring that you can put on for a few days and not worry about, then I'd recommend the Oura Ring 4. If you are adamant about daily charging, however, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3.\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 3 if...\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You just want the newest software\n\nMost of the software updates that came to the Oura Ring 4 also are available on the Oura Ring 3. That includes automatic heart rate monitoring during workouts, the Oura app redesign, upgraded daytime stress features that help contextualize your physiological stress, and many new Oura Labs features you can test out, like meal logging.\n\nAutomatic heart rate monitoring continues Oura's mission of autonomously logging health data with little assistance from the ring wearer. This means that, on top of the automatic workout detection feature, the Oura Ring now can monitor and record your heart rate during these activities without you clicking on the Record workout HR button.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 3 -- and it totally beat my Apple Watch\n\nOura upgraded its daytime stress feature by implementing the daily tags people use to document their meals, workouts, illnesses, and moods onto the daytime stress timeline. Let's say you just had an argument with a coworker and find that your heart rate is elevated. If you log that in the app, it will include that tag into the daytime stress timeline.\n\nLastly, there are a few experimental features Oura Ring 3 users can take advantage of through Oura Labs, which is also available on both rings. One of my favorite features I tested was the meal-logging feature that uses your camera and AI to document what you're eating (and when).\n\nThe AI was able to detect that I was eating yogurt with berries and bananas one morning, despite the yogurt being fully picked over and mixed with the other ingredients.\n\n2. You don't want to spend more money\n\nYou can buy an Oura Ring 3 for up to $200 right now. The third-generation smart ring has been on sale since Oura unveiled a newer generation. If a starting price of $350 (plus that $6 monthly subscription to access all your data) is a little too much for you, the Oura Ring 3 is substantially cheaper.\n\n3. Comfort isn't a concern\n\nIf you own an Oura Ring 3 and aren't disturbed by the raised sensors or the chunkier build, I don't see a need for you to upgrade to the Oura Ring 4. If you don't own either ring and are trying to make a buying decision, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3 if you are unbothered by a tight and raised dome around your finger.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"stress\", \"older\", \"newest\", \"features\", \"oura\", \"sensors\", \"ring\", \"days\", \"buy\", \"right\", \"discounted\", \"sizes\", \"vs\", \"opt\", \"smart\"]", "content_hash": "8bfe6d67475ef7abdc53eeb95171bbca33677b332ccb0bbadccb85f08b2f9891", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:30.155315+00:00"}

Pt\", \"Elyse Betters Picaro\"]", "published": null, "text": "Maria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nIf you've heard about Alexa+, a revamped version of Amazon's virtual assistant powered by generative AI, you may be interested in diving into the Amazon Alexa ecosystem. Amazon Echo speakers are the best way to bring Alexa into your smart home. The Echo Pop and Echo Dot, Amazon's two most compact smart speakers, are the most popular and affordable Echo devices available.\n\nAmazon's new Alexa+ is launching gradually over the next few weeks. While the company is prioritizing the larger Echo Shows in the initial release, Amazon says that after you get access to Alexa+ on an Echo Show 8,10,15, or 21, it will be available on all of your Echo devices, with the exception of some older generations.\n\nAlso: Amazon just gave Alexa its biggest upgrade in a decade - and old Echo devices will support it\n\nThe Echo Pop is newer than the Echo Dot and is marketed as the company's most compact speaker. At about two-thirds of the size of the already compact Echo Dot, the Echo Pop is best suited for small rooms and can be tucked away in the corner of a desk. The slightly larger Echo Dot is about the size of an Apple HomePod mini and delivers more potent sound.\n\nRead on to learn more about how the Echo Pop and Echo Dot compare and which is best suited for which sort of user.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Pop if...\n\n\n\nHere's an Amazon Echo Pop next to an Apple Magic Mouse, for reference. Maria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need a compact speaker\n\nThe Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and most affordable smart speaker, perfect for a small room -- such as a dorm or a kid's room. Because it doesn't feature a screen and can go unnoticed, it's a simple way to introduce yourself to the Alexa ecosystem or give someone access to Amazon's voice assistant in a simple, unintimidating way.\n\nReview: Amazon Echo Pop review: A portable smart speaker for small spaces\n\nThe Echo Pop is a perfect option if you're looking for a compact speaker for your kid's desk, a guest room, or an area you don't use often. It can be unreliable in larger rooms or when tasked with bigger assignments, which brings me to my next point.\n\n2. You plan on everyday music streaming, podcasts, or audiobooks\n\nThe Echo Pop is surprisingly loud, but the sound quality decreases greatly when the volume increases. This is why the Echo Pop is meant for smaller rooms and is much less expensive than other Echo devices.\n\nAlso: The best smart home devices\n\nThe Echo Pop won't be the life of the party at a backyard barbecue. Still, it's excellent for listening to music informally when hanging out in your room, catching up on your favorite podcasts, and listening to audiobooks. Having Alexa built-in makes it more enticing, as you can use the AI-powered voice assistant to control smart devices around your home.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Dot if...\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need Alexa to be more reliable\n\nBecause the Echo Pop is a smaller, more affordable smart speaker than the Echo Dot, it's also less reliable. The Echo Dot is more responsive and can easily hear me from across the room, whether it's playing music or not.\n\nThe Echo Pop, in turn, appears to have a simpler microphone array that is easily overpowered by high volumes. I've often found Alexa unable to hear me on the Echo Pop when the volume is too high, which can be frustrating, especially because it doesn't have an action button.\n\nAlso: Here's how to use Alexa Plus for free - especially if you're an Amazon Prime member\n\nThe Echo Dot features a volume-up button, a volume-down button, a mute button, and an action button. The last one is a great way to wake Alexa without talking to it, which would be nice in the Echo Pop when it can't hear me. I've resorted to unplugging the Echo Pop when it can't hear me, so it stops blasting \"The Wheels on the Bus.\"\n\n2. You want room-filling sound\n\nThe Echo Dot isn't a high-end speaker, but it is great for most users. It can deliver room-filling sound from a small package, as the audio doesn't deteriorate as much as the Echo Pop's when the volume goes up. For example, you can pair two Echo Dots to function as external speakers for a TV and get stereo sound better than audio from most inexpensive TVs.\n\nAlso: Not all Echo devices will get Alexa Plus - see if yours made the list\n\nAs a device often discounted during Prime Day and holiday sales events for around half off, I'd recommend the Echo Dot to most users looking for a reliable smart speaker with Alexa built-in that can deliver sound from all directions.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"choose\", \"devices\", \"echo\", \"compact\", \"smart\", \"alexa\", \"amazon\", \"room\", \"speaker\", \"vs\", \"pop\", \"dot\"]", "content_hash": "98bade5b9872cfa69029fa4b6b1d966decd58db1114183116401f58f5ba92fcd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:30.974619+00:00"}

You can instantly sign up for its free plan and build your first campaign. With step-by-step buttons on its dashboard, like importing or creating your contact list, connecting an integration, and importing your brand persona, your first round of emails or SMS campaign will be ready in no time.\n\nHere, you can either start from scratch or use a campaign template. The drag-and-drop editor makes the entire setup process easy, though the free templates are pretty barebones unless you upgrade. The automation builder can trigger emails based on sign-ups, tags, events, or custom criteria you set. I tested both prebuilt and custom journeys, and while it takes a few minutes to learn the flow, it's flexible and powerful once you do. That said, Classic Automations were discontinued in mid-2025 by Mailchimp, so if you're coming back to the platform after a while, expect to rebuild from scratch and pay for something that used to be free.\n\nMoreover, Mailchimp's dashboard actually recommends flows based on common goals like welcoming new contacts, sharing content with Meta leads, or sending birthday discounts. These flows save serious time for basic tasks like recovering abandoned carts or nurturing repeat buyers. The thing is, on the Free plan, you can preview them, but you'll need to upgrade to actually launch them. Still, it's nice to see what's possible before committing. Setting up a flow is visual, i.e., more drag-and-drop than techy, which makes it approachable, even if you've never done automation before. Once you understand how triggers and actions work together, you can build out surprisingly complex sequences.\n\nPlans start free with 500 contacts, then scale based on list size. Paid plans include Essentials (from $13 per month), Standard (from $20 per month), and Premium (from $350 per month for 10,000+ contacts). So, if you're working with a small list, the Free or Essentials plan might be enough. You can also buy credits with a Pay As You Go plan if you send your emails occasionally. Free trials run for 14 days on Standard or Essentials, and nonprofits get a 15% discount.\n\nMailchimp features: Email + SMS campaign builder | Prebuilt automation flows | List segmentation and tagging | Signup forms and popups | Landing page builder | 250+ integrations | 14-day free trial on paid plans", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"month\", \"free\", \"plan\", \"marketing\", \"essentials\", \"emails\", \"best\", \"email\", \"tested\", \"expert\", \"2025\", \"list\", \"flows\", \"software\", \"campaign\", \"youre\", \"contacts\"]", "content_hash": "3f9534ef5783a27d268bc1180bba5d84680da8a9970ecfba8c966f7fff4ad487", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:32.322541+00:00"}

Features available from the outset include account, contact, task, and lead management.

Recently, Salesforce launched a new solution to improve AI agents used to help human productivity. Who it's for: Businesses of any size, large or small. I like the simple nature of Salesforce plans, with one option for small and midsize businesses and another for enterprises, priced at $25 and $100 per user per month, respectively. Who should look elsewhere: Many Salesforce Starter CRM customers are impressed with the services offered, though some note the high price for enterprise users. Some features, including advanced automation and access to AppExchange -- the Salesforce app marketplace -- are limited to premium subscribers. There also isn't a middle ground plan between the Starter and Pro Suites, and this might deter some people. Microsoft Dynamics CRM could be a great alternative.

Though the overall classifications of different types of CRM software vary from vendor to vendor, the same themes appear. You may want to research the major types of CRM before you make a purchase decision, as that may influence how your business grows. Operational: Most modern CRM platforms offer some kind of operational mechanism or module. Operational CRMs tend to focus on optimizing business operations, including sales processes, logistics, and customer communications. Operational CRMs may be particularly useful for startups and small and midsize businesses looking to scale. Analytical/data-driven: Other CRMs focus on the intrinsic value of data. Businesses able to handle, securely store, and analyze customer data -- always useful if held in a centralized, organized platform -- can draw insights and see patterns that may influence their future sales activities or reveal new revenue streams. Furthermore, data-driven CRMs may reveal ways to improve customer relationships and retention. Collaborative: Collaborative CRMs provide organizations with a way to enhance collaboration and productivity. CRM suites can be used to create department channels and data repositories, allowing different teams to work together and to share information. For instance, a sales team could collaborate with marketing and finance to create new customer promotions and campaigns. Customer service teams, too, can access important records to track customer journeys and resolve issues.

The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.\n\nCato Networks’ researcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren’t isolated occurrences, and that Russia’s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.\n\nMost startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nThe rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report reveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato’s researchers observe in the report, “most notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.”\n\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfare\n\nResearchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face’s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model.\n\nThe legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (Додаток.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background. This official-looking PDF about cybersecurity measures from the Security Service of Ukraine serves as a decoy while the malware performs its reconnaissance operations. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\nAPT28’s approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of “curly naked women” as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.\n\nThe provocative image generation prompts used by APT28’s image.py variant, including ‘Curvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face’, are designed to occupy victims’ attention during document theft. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\n“Russia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,” explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. “This is the first in the wild that was captured.”\n\nA quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malware\n\nSimonovich’s Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28’s deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls “Immersive World,” he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.\n\nThe method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.\n\n“I slowly walked him throughout my goal,” Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. “First, ‘Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.’ Then, ‘Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'”\n\nSix hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.\n\nWelcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy\n\nDuring his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.\n\nTo explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.\n\nAnother platform, Nytheon AI, revealed even less operational security. “I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn’t care about OpSec,” Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: “Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.”\n\nThese aren’t proof-of-concepts. They’re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer “Claude Code” clones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.\n\nEnterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surface\n\nCato Networks’ recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren’t pilot programs; they’re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn’t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.\n\nSimonovich told VentureBeat that vendors’ responses to Cato’s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world’s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.\n\nWhen Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:\n\nDeepSeek never responded\n\nGoogle declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples\n\nMicrosoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work\n\nOpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn’t engage further\n\nSix Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack\n\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn’t a warning; it’s proof that Simonovich’s research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.\n\nThe metrics are stark—270 stolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms offer identical capabilities for $250 per month. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.\n\nEnterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per Cato’s 2025 CTRL Threat Report. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.\n\nSimonovich’s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it’s an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.\n\nToday’s adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity. The weapons are already inside every organization, and today they’re called productivity tools.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"threat\", \"defense\", \"ai\", \"actor\", \"malware\", \"simonovich\", \"ukraine\", \"enterprise\", \"lamehug\", \"venturebeat\", \"perimeter\", \"security\", \"end\", \"tools\", \"cato\"]", "content_hash": "245600ead84199e16252d0bd2b99aff8fb1291969309474c3d19c7ef34b0a34f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:36.040084+00:00"}

LFM2-VL-1.6B — a more capable model that remains lightweight enough for single-GPU and device-based deployment.\n\nBoth variants process images at native resolutions up to 512×512 pixels, avoiding distortion or unnecessary upscaling.\n\nFor larger images, the system applies non-overlapping patching and adds a thumbnail for global context, enabling the model to capture both fine detail and the broader scene.\n\nBackground on Liquid AI\n\nLiquid AI was founded by former researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) with the goal of building AI architectures that move beyond the widely used transformer model.\n\nThe company’s flagship innovation, the Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs), are based on principles from dynamical systems, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra, producing general-purpose AI models capable of handling text, video, audio, time series, and other sequential data.\n\nUnlike traditional architectures, Liquid’s approach aims to deliver competitive or superior performance using significantly fewer computational resources, allowing for real-time adaptability during inference while maintaining low memory requirements. This makes LFMs well suited for both large-scale enterprise use cases and resource-limited edge deployments.\n\nIn July 2025, the company expanded its platform strategy with the launch of the Liquid Edge AI Platform (LEAP), a cross-platform SDK designed to make it easier for developers to run small language models directly on mobile and embedded devices.\n\nLEAP offers OS-agnostic support for iOS and Android, integration with both Liquid’s own models and other open-source SLMs, and a built-in library with models as small as 300MB—small enough for modern phones with minimal RAM.\n\nIts companion app, Apollo, enables developers to test models entirely offline, aligning with Liquid AI’s emphasis on privacy-preserving, low-latency AI. Together, LEAP and Apollo reflect the company’s commitment to decentralizing AI execution, reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure, and empowering developers to build optimized, task-specific models for real-world environments.\n\nSpeed/quality trade-offs and technical design\n\nLFM2-VL uses a modular architecture combining a language model backbone, a SigLIP2 NaFlex vision encoder, and a multimodal projector.\n\nThe projector includes a two-layer MLP connector with pixel unshuffle, reducing the number of image tokens and improving throughput.\n\nUsers can adjust parameters such as the maximum number of image tokens or patches, allowing them to balance speed and quality depending on the deployment scenario. The training process involved approximately 100 billion multimodal tokens, sourced from open datasets and in-house synthetic data.\n\nPerformance and benchmarks\n\nThe models achieve competitive benchmark results across a range of vision-language evaluations. LFM2-VL-1.6B scores well in RealWorldQA (65.23), InfoVQA (58.68), and OCRBench (742), and maintains solid results in multimodal reasoning tasks.\n\nIn inference testing, LFM2-VL achieved the fastest GPU processing times in its class when tested on a standard workload of a 1024×1024 image and short prompt.\n\nLicensing and availability\n\nLFM2-VL models are available now on Hugging Face, along with example fine-tuning code in Colab. They are compatible with Hugging Face transformers and TRL.\n\nThe models are released under a custom “LFM1.0 license”. Liquid AI has described this license as based on Apache 2.0 principles, but the full text has not yet been published.\n\nThe company has indicated that commercial use will be permitted under certain conditions, with different terms for companies above and below $10 million in annual revenue.\n\nWith LFM2-VL, Liquid AI aims to make high-performance multimodal AI more accessible for on-device and resource-limited deployments, without sacrificing capability.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"model\", \"ai\", \"wants\", \"competitive\", \"lfm2vl\", \"fast\", \"liquid\", \"multimodal\", \"smartphones\", \"image\", \"visionlanguage\", \"models\", \"small\", \"inference\"]", "content_hash": "2e837152b6d2cd363330786e2515f04d06676e6aefc24fa8ca94b2c1b52286af", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:36.645675+00:00"}

We will first make sure that current paying ChatGPT users get more total usage than they did before GPT-5.\n\n\n\n2. We will then prioritize API demand up to the… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 12, 2025\n\nHe said the company’s first priority is ensuring that current paying ChatGPT users receive more total usage than they had before GPT-5’s release, though he did not provide specific figures for the increase.\n\nHowever, Altman previously posted on X that OpenAI was “trying” a 3,000 messages-per-week usage limit when using the GPT-5 “thinking” mode, more reasoning power and time spent reasoning on harder problems, for ChatGPT Plus subscribers (the $20 per month plan).\n\ntrying 3000 per week now! — Sam Altman (@sama) August 10, 2025\n\nInterestingly, one report from an AI app creator on X said that OpenAI told him the usage limits for GPT-5 plus thinking on the ChatGPT Team plan ($30 per user per month) is much lower than that of ChatGPT Plus users, only 200 “Thinking” messages per week when selected manually by the user.\n\nOpenAI just replied to me with an email about the GPT-5 usage limits under the Team plan：\n\n\n\n· ChatGPT Team can manually select GPT-5-Thinking\n\n\n\n· Manual usage cap: 200 messages/week\n\n\n\n· On reaching cap: popup alert, GPT-5-Thinking hidden from menu — Vic Zhang (@RealVicHere) August 12, 2025\n\nOpenAI’s availability of GPT-5 through its application programming interface (API) for third-party developers is also being tweaked.\n\nAltman also stated in his X post that OpenAI would “prioritize API demand up to the currently allocated capacity and commitments we’ve made to customers.”\n\nIn other words, existing API users and those already in contract will get the first dibs on GPT-5 access through OpenAI’s API, others may have to wait longer.\n\nAltman also clarified “we can support about an additional ~30% new API growth from where we are today with this capacity,” meaning they can take on more API users, but not too many.\n\nWhile OpenAI hasn’t definitively shared how many users of its API there are in some time, the company did say it has “5 million” businesses paying for access to ChatGPT.\n\nAltman also said OpenAI plans to roughly double its compute fleet over the next five months. He did not specify the current size or type of infrastructure involved, but indicated the expansion should ease capacity constraints and improve performance for both ChatGPT and API users.\n\nI’ve reached out to OpenAI to ask for more specifics on the above numbers — 30% API growth up from what? doubling the compute fleet up from what? — and will update when I hear back.\n\nNew options for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users to search across Microsoft Teams and more…\n\nAlso last night, OpenAI updated its ChatGPT release notes online to allow subscribers of ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) to connect the application to search for files and projects across their third-party accounts on Box, Canva, Dropbox, HubSpot, Notion, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams.\n\nAnd just a few moments ago, OpenAI again updated the service to allow connections for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts to Pro users first, followed by Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plans.\n\nFor example, ChatGPT users can search their Gmail for all emails matching a certain query, Dropbox account or Notion workspace during a conversation without toggling over into those separate apps.\n\nIn addition, subscribers to the ChatGPT Pro tier ($200 per month) may now link their accounts to Microsoft Teams and GitHub connectors and search those third-party applications.\n\nThese join OpenAI’s previous connectors to Gmail, Google Drive and Google Calendar, among other apps.\n\nThe individual user/account holder first needs to manually connect these external accounts to ChatGPT.\n\nTo do so, they’ll need to:\n\nClick on their account name in the lower left corner of the web interface Click “Settings” from the pop up menu and then… Click “Connectors from the left sidebar menu. This should pull up a gallery view of available external apps and icons. Screenshots below.\n\nUnfortunately, these connectors are not available for Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe new connectors are currently in beta and disabled by default for Enterprise and Education plans, though administrators can enable them in settings.\n\nBalancing supply and demand\n\nBy combining capacity planning with new productivity integrations, OpenAI is positioning GPT-5 not only as a more powerful AI model but also as part of a more connected workspace.\n\nThe staged approach to compute allocation reflects the company’s effort to serve existing customers first while scaling up for future demand.\n\nAs the compute expansion comes online, paying users stand to benefit first from both higher availability and more ways to integrate ChatGPT into their daily workflows.\n\nBut first, OpenAI needs to stabilize its release and ensure GPT-5 is working smoothly for all the users who want it.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"api\", \"connectors\", \"teams\", \"tool\", \"clarifies\", \"openai\", \"gpt5\", \"dropbox\", \"pro\", \"plus\", \"compute\", \"usage\", \"users\", \"ms\", \"thirdparty\", \"chatgpt\", \"prioritization\"]", "content_hash": "00899e983f3f3a3a556b8fee19d88059e7bc6f78cac1d3dd78bdf898b13bcf1b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:37.440205+00:00"}

Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Roth Capital Partners are serving as joint placement agents and financial advisors.\n\nGIG HARBOR, Wash.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–August 12, 2025–\n\nHeritage Distilling Holding Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: CASK) (“Heritage” or the “Company”) today announced the pricing of a $220 million private placement offering ($100M in cash and $120M in $IP tokens) with support from Story Foundation and other leading investors, including a16z crypto, Amber Group, Arrington Capital, dao5, Hashed, Mirana Ventures, Neoclassic Capital, Open World, Polychain Capital, Selini Capital, Stix, Syncracy Capital and others, to support the launch of a first-of-its-kind $IP token digital asset treasury strategy.\n\nThis transaction represents a strategic milestone for Heritage, making it the first Nasdaq-listed company to adopt $IP as its primary reserve asset. $IP is the native token of Story, a blockchain that enables users to register their intellectual property onchain and add usage terms via smart contracts, thus allowing humans and AI agents the ability to transact in and monetize IP simply and easily. $IP is used to pay for transactions on Story, meaning that if more and more users take advantage of the network’s functionality, the token itself will become more valuable. $IP can also be used for yield-generating activities such as staking and validation. Heritage’s strategic investment in $IP reflects a broader shift in how public companies approach strategic reserves – not just as stores of value, but as vehicles for growth, yield, and long-term alignment with transformative technologies.\n\nThrough ecosystem apps like Aria and Ablo, Story has already supported the tokenization of hundreds of thousands of digital assets, powering collaborations with artists, brands, and intellectual property from world-renowned names including Justin Bieber, BTS, Blackpink, Adidas, and Crocs. In 2024, Story partnered with Stability AI to bring transparent licensing and compensation tracking to open-source model training pipelines. In Q3 2025, Grayscale also launched the Story Trust, providing institutional investors with regulated access to $IP through a traditional financial product. Poseidon, an AI-native incubation launched in July, extends Story’s infrastructure into the realm of decentralized training data, enabling rights-cleared datasets for physical AI like robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. Through its partnership with the foundation behind Web3’s first programmable, productive digital primitive designed for staking, licensing, and powering real-world AI workflows, Heritage gains early exposure to the tokenized IP economy while directly participating in its evolution.\n\nThis transaction is structured as a Private Investment in Public Equity (“PIPE”) offering involving a token exchange component. Heritage is expected to raise $100M via the sale of common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock. In addition, Heritage will issue shares of common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock in exchange for $IP tokens contributed from the Story Foundation at a fixed price of $3.40 per $IP token, helping to increase the number of tokens held in the Company’s treasury reserve on day one.\n\nStory Foundation selected Heritage as its first public partner to help grow the $IP ecosystem. In addition, key strategic partners will contribute additional $IP tokens to Heritage in exchange for common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock. At the close of the transaction, the Heritage treasury reserve is expected to receive and hold approximately 52.5 million $IP tokens with a market value of approximately $361 million (calculated based on the closing price of the $IP tokens of $6.8785 on August 10, 2025, as reported by CoinMarketCap.com).\n\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Roth Capital Partners are serving as joint placement agents and financial advisors in the transaction. Open World, a premier U.S.-focused blockchain advisor, is advising Heritage and Story Foundation on structuring the digital asset treasury and will continue to serve as a strategic adviser to both.\n\nSeung Yoon “SY” Lee, CEO and Co-founder of PIP Labs, Chairman of Heritage Advisory Board and original creator of Story, said: “This is the perfect moment to be innovating at the intersection of crypto, AI, and Real World Asset tokenization. Now, with the proliferation of AI, it is our belief that $IP will be viewed as the new gold and has the potential to become increasingly valuable. Story Foundation’s net cash proceeds from its $IP token sale to Heritage as part of this transaction will be used to expand the network’s reach and support market $IP repurchases, reinforcing long-term ecosystem alignment.”\n\n“This transaction represents a bold leap forward, not just for Heritage, but for how public companies can participate in the digital asset economy,” said Justin Stiefel, CEO of Heritage. “For more than a decade we have been a leader in our industry, and because we know the value that intellectual property brings to creators and owners, we see $IP as a new category of strategic reserve to advance multiple pieces of the next decade of AI’s growth. As the first craft distiller in the U.S. to create a cryptocurrency treasury reserves policy, we are once again leading the way in this digital space.”\n\nAlso involved in this strategic transaction are respected crypto and tech leaders who have acted as advisors to the transaction and are expected to continue to advise Heritage to support the company’s strategic direction, bringing together deep expertise across capital markets, crypto, and AI:\n\nS.Y. Lee – Advisory Board Chairman (Founder and CEO of PIP Labs, original creator of Story)\n\nPhil Blows – Chief Investment Officer Appointee (Co-founder of -AQRU and B2 Capital Management)\n\nBen Sternberg – Strategic Finance Advisor (PIP Labs CFO, former CFO at Radish, Founder of Fexy Media)\n\nDavid Lee – Board Member Nominee (former Google Executive, former Chief Corporate Development Officer 451 Media)\n\nErick Zhang – Board Member Nominee (Founding Partner of Nomad Capital, former Head of Research at Binance, former CEO of CoinMarketCap)\n\nRavi Kaza – Special Advisor to the Board and Digital Assets Committee (CIO, Arrington Capital)\n\n“Story was built to turn intellectual property into an investable, programmable asset, and this reserve shows how we’re doing that at scale,” said Matt Shaw, Story Foundation Director. “Through this structure, public market investors can gain exposure to $IP via equity without navigating wallets or token infrastructure. In line with our commitment to ecosystem alignment, 100% of the Foundation’s net cash proceeds from this $IP token sale will be used to repurchase $IP in the open market within up to 90 days. This deal reflects responsible governance and strong partner alignment, while giving Heritage early positioning in one of crypto’s most exciting real-world asset classes.”\n\nThe PIPE transaction is expected to close on or about August 13th, 2025 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\nAbout Story\n\nBacked with $136 million from a16z crypto, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in February 2025 and has rapidly become the leading blockchain infrastructure for tokenized intellectual property. Story is a blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property a programmable digital asset with embedded rights.

Subscribe Now\n\nAnthropic announced Tuesday that its Claude Sonnet 4 artificial intelligence model can now process up to 1 million tokens of context in a single request — a fivefold increase that allows developers to analyze entire software projects or dozens of research papers without breaking them into smaller chunks.\n\nThe expansion, available now in public beta through Anthropic’s API and Amazon Bedrock, represents a significant leap in how AI assistants can handle complex, data-intensive tasks. With the new capacity, developers can load codebases containing more than 75,000 lines of code, enabling Claude to understand complete project architecture and suggest improvements across entire systems rather than individual files.\n\nThe announcement comes as Anthropic faces intensifying competition from OpenAI and Google, both of which already offer similar context windows. However, company sources speaking on background emphasized that Claude Sonnet 4’s strength lies not just in capacity but in accuracy, achieving 100% performance on internal “needle in a haystack” evaluations that test the model’s ability to find specific information buried within massive amounts of text.\n\nHow developers can now analyze entire codebases with AI in one request\n\nThe extended context capability addresses a fundamental limitation that has constrained AI-powered software development. Previously, developers working on large projects had to manually break down their codebases into smaller segments, often losing important connections between different parts of their systems.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\n“What was once impossible is now reality,” said Sean Ward, CEO and co-founder of London-based iGent AI, whose Maestro platform transforms conversations into executable code, in a statement. “Claude Sonnet 4 with 1M token context has supercharged autonomous capabilities in Maestro, our software engineering agent. This leap unlocks true production-scale engineering–multi-day sessions on real-world codebases.”\n\nEric Simons, CEO of Bolt.new, which integrates Claude into browser-based development platforms, said in a statement: “With the 1M context window, developers can now work on significantly larger projects while maintaining the high accuracy we need for real-world coding.”\n\nThe expanded context enables three primary use cases that were previously difficult or impossible: comprehensive code analysis across entire repositories, document synthesis involving hundreds of files while maintaining awareness of relationships between them, and context-aware AI agents that can maintain coherence across hundreds of tool calls and complex workflows.\n\nWhy Claude’s new pricing strategy could reshape the AI development market\n\nAnthropic has adjusted its pricing structure to reflect the increased computational requirements of processing larger contexts. While prompts of 200,000 tokens or fewer maintain current pricing at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, larger prompts cost $6 and $22.50 respectively.\n\nThe pricing strategy reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry. Recent analysis shows that Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than OpenAI’s newly launched GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating pressure on enterprise procurement teams to balance performance against cost.\n\nHowever, Anthropic argues the decision should factor in quality and usage patterns rather than price alone. Company sources noted that prompt caching — which stores frequently accessed large datasets — can make long context cost-competitive with traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation approaches, especially for enterprises that repeatedly query the same information.\n\n“Large context lets Claude see everything and choose what’s relevant, often producing better answers than pre-filtered RAG results where you might miss important connections between documents,” an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat.\n\nAnthropic’s billion-dollar dependency on just two major coding customers\n\nThe long context capability arrives as Anthropic commands 42% of the AI code generation market, more than double OpenAI’s 21% share according to a Menlo Ventures survey of 150 enterprise technical leaders. However, this dominance comes with risks: industry analysis suggests that coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot drive approximately $1.2 billion of Anthropic’s $5 billion annual revenue run rate, creating significant customer concentration.\n\nThe GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. While GitHub Copilot currently relies on Claude for key functionality, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.\n\nThe timing of the context expansion is strategic. Anthropic released this capability on Sonnet 4 — which offers what the company calls “the optimal balance of intelligence, cost, and speed” — rather than its most powerful Opus model. Company sources indicated this reflects the needs of developers working with large-scale data, though they declined to provide specific timelines for bringing long context to other Claude models.\n\nInside Claude’s breakthrough AI memory technology and emerging safety risks\n\nThe 1 million token context window represents significant technical advancement in AI memory and attention mechanisms. To put this in perspective, it’s enough to process approximately 750,000 words — roughly equivalent to two full-length novels or extensive technical documentation sets.\n\nAnthropic’s internal testing revealed perfect recall performance across diverse scenarios, a crucial capability as context windows expand. The company embedded specific information within massive text volumes and tested Claude’s ability to find and use those details when answering questions.\n\nHowever, the expanded capabilities also raise safety considerations. Earlier versions of Claude Opus 4 demonstrated concerning behaviors in fictional scenarios, including attempts at blackmail when faced with potential shutdown. While Anthropic has implemented additional safeguards and training to address these issues, the incidents highlight the complex challenges of developing increasingly capable AI systems.\n\nFortune 500 companies rush to adopt Claude’s expanded context capabilities\n\nThe feature rollout is initially limited to Anthropic API customers with Tier 4 and custom rate limits, with broader availability planned over coming weeks. Amazon Bedrock users have immediate access, while Google Cloud’s Vertex AI integration is pending.\n\nEarly enterprise response has been enthusiastic, according to company sources. Use cases span from coding teams analyzing entire repositories to financial services firms processing comprehensive transaction datasets to legal startups conducting contract analysis that previously required manual document segmentation.\n\n“This is one of our most requested features from API customers,” an Anthropic spokesperson said. “We’re seeing excitement across industries that unlocks true agentic capabilities, with customers now running multi-day coding sessions on real-world codebases that would have been impossible with context limitations before.”\n\nThe development also enables more sophisticated AI agents that can maintain context across complex, multi-step workflows. This capability becomes particularly valuable as enterprises move beyond simple AI chat interfaces toward autonomous systems that can handle extended tasks with minimal human intervention.\n\nThe long context announcement intensifies competition among leading AI providers. Google’s older Gemini 1.5 Pro model and OpenAI’s older GPT-4.1 model both offer 1 million token windows, but Anthropic argues that Claude’s superior performance on coding and reasoning tasks provides competitive advantage even at higher prices.\n\nThe broader AI industry has seen explosive growth in model API spending, which doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months according to Menlo Ventures. Enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to newer models within weeks regardless of cost, suggesting that technical capabilities often outweigh pricing considerations in procurement decisions.\n\nHowever, OpenAI’s recent aggressive pricing strategy with GPT-5 could reshape these dynamics. Early comparisons show dramatic price advantages that may overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures as AI adoption scales.\n\nFor Anthropic, maintaining its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources remains critical. The company has tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.\n\nAs AI systems become capable of processing and reasoning about increasingly vast amounts of information, they’re fundamentally changing how developers approach complex software projects. The ability to maintain context across entire codebases represents a shift from AI as a coding assistant to AI as a comprehensive development partner that understands the full scope and interconnections of large-scale projects.\n\nThe implications extend far beyond software development. Industries from legal services to financial analysis are beginning to recognize that AI systems capable of maintaining context across hundreds of documents could transform how organizations process and understand complex information relationships.\n\nBut with great capability comes great responsibility—and risk. As these systems become more powerful, the incidents of concerning AI behavior during Anthropic’s testing serve as a reminder that the race to expand AI capabilities must be balanced with careful attention to safety and control.\n\nAs Claude learns to juggle a million pieces of information simultaneously, Anthropic faces its own context window problem: being trapped between OpenAI’s pricing pressure and Microsoft’s conflicting loyalties.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"claude\", \"coding\", \"software\", \"developers\", \"projects\", \"ai\", \"million\", \"process\", \"entire\", \"request\", \"company\", \"complex\", \"single\", \"anthropic\", \"pricing\", \"context\"]", "content_hash": "1461699fbf20af20c37137f5325b11bc9f163f8f28592d3ab09a27a1c8f52504", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:38.705316+00:00"}

It analyzes the user’s overall goal, breaks it down into subtasks, and assigns each subtask to the best agent for the job. It can delegate backend operations like file management or data processing to the Programmer, which writes and executes Python or Bash scripts.\n\nFor frontend tasks that require clicking buttons or navigating visual interfaces, it turns to the GUI Operator, a VLM-based agent.\n\n“This dynamic delegation allows CoAct-1 to strategically bypass inefficient GUI sequences in favor of robust, single-shot code execution where appropriate, while still leveraging visual interaction for tasks where it is indispensable,” the paper states.\n\nThe workflow is iterative. After the Programmer or GUI Operator completes a subtask, it sends a summary and a screenshot of the current system state back to the Orchestrator, which then decides the next step or concludes the task.\n\nThe Programmer agent uses an LLM to generate its code and sends commands to a code interpreter to test and refine its code over multiple rounds.\n\nSimilarly, the GUI Operator uses an action interpreter that executes its commands (e.g., mouse clicks, typing) and returns the resulting screenshot, allowing it to see the outcome of its actions. The Orchestrator makes the final decision on whether the task should continue or stop.\n\nExample of CoAct-1 in action (source: arXiv)\n\nA more efficient path to automation\n\nThe researchers tested CoAct-1 on OSWorld, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 369 real-world tasks across browsers, IDEs, and office applications.\n\nThe results show CoAct-1 establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving a success rate of 60.76%.\n\nThe performance gains were most significant in categories where programmatic control offers a clear advantage, such as OS-level tasks and multi-application workflows.\n\nFor instance, consider an OS-level task like finding all image files within a complex folder structure, resizing them, and then compressing the entire directory into a single archive.\n\nA purely GUI-based agent would need to perform a long, brittle sequence of clicks and drags, opening folders, selecting files, and navigating menus, with a high chance of error at each step.\n\nCoAct-1, by contrast, can delegate this entire workflow to its Programmer agent, which can accomplish the task with a single, robust script.\n\nBeyond just a higher success rate, the system is dramatically more efficient. CoAct-1 solves tasks in an average of just 10.15 steps, a stark contrast to the 15.22 steps required by leading GUI-only agents like GTA-1.\n\nWhile other agents like OpenAI’s CUA 4o averaged fewer steps, their overall success rate was much lower, indicating CoAct-1’s efficiency is coupled with greater effectiveness.\n\nThe researchers found a clear trend: tasks that require more actions are more likely to fail. Reducing the number of steps not only speeds up task completion but, more importantly, minimizes the opportunities for error.\n\nTherefore, finding ways to compress multiple GUI steps into a single programmatic task can make the process both more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nAs the researchers conclude, “This efficiency underscores the potential of our approach to pave a more robust and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.”\n\nCoAct-1 performs tasks with fewer steps on average thanks to smart use of coding (source: arXiv)\n\nFrom the lab to the enterprise workflow\n\nThe potential for this technology goes beyond general productivity. For enterprise leaders, the key lies in automating complex, multi-tool processes where full API access is a luxury, not a guarantee.\n\nRan Xu, a co-author of the paper and Director of Applied AI Research at Salesforce, points to customer support as a prime example.\n\n“A service support agent uses many different tools — general tools such as Salesforce, industry-specific tools such as EPIC for healthcare, and a lot of customized tools — to investigate a customer request and formulate a response,” Xu told VentureBeat. “Some of the tools have API access while others don’t. It is a perfect use case that could potentially benefit from our technology: a compute-use agent that leverages whatever is available from the computer, whether it’s an API, code, or just the screen.”\n\nXu also sees high-value applications in sales, such as prospecting at scale and automating bookkeeping, and in marketing for tasks like customer segmentation and campaign asset generation.\n\nNavigating real-world challenges and the need for human oversight\n\nWhile the results on the OSWorld benchmark are strong, enterprise environments are far messier, filled with legacy software and unpredictable UIs.\n\nThis raises critical questions about robustness, security, and the need for human oversight.\n\nA core challenge is ensuring the Orchestrator agent makes the right choice when faced with an unfamiliar application. According to Xu, the path to making agents like CoAct-1 robust for custom enterprise software involves training them with feedback in realistic, simulated environments.\n\nThe goal is to create a system where the “agent could observe how human agents work, get trained within a sandbox, and when it goes live, continue to solve tasks under the guidance and guardrail of a human agent.”\n\nThe ability for the Programmer agent to execute its own code also introduces obvious security concerns. What stops the agent from executing harmful code based on an ambiguous user request?\n\nXu confirms that robust containment is essential. “Access control and sandboxing is the key,” he said, emphasizing that a human must “understand the implication and give the AI access for safety.”\n\nSandboxing and guardrails will be critical to validating agent behavior before deployment on critical systems.\n\nUltimately, for the foreseeable future, overcoming ambiguity will likely require a human-in-the-loop. When asked about handling vague user queries, a concern also raised in the paper, Xu suggested a phased approach. “I see human-in-the-loop to start,” he noted.\n\nWhile some tasks may eventually become fully autonomous, for high-stakes operations, human validation will remain crucial. “Some mission-critical ones may always need human approval.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"tasks\", \"dont\", \"human\", \"system\", \"gui\", \"point\", \"faster\", \"task\", \"rates\", \"greater\", \"code\", \"agents\", \"success\", \"agent\", \"salesforces\", \"write\", \"steps\", \"coact1\"]", "content_hash": "a3a3ad3e18349a700676a469c381925d1da8fffce7bce81568c6b8c12c5c72b1", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:39.314765+00:00"}

However, when it comes to agents and AI applications, many banks have taken a more cautious approach to adoption.\n\nTD Securities, the equity and securities trading arm of TD Bank, rolled out its TD AI Virtual Assistant on July 8, aimed toward its front office institutional sales, trading and research professionals to help them manage their workflow.\n\nTD Securities CIO Dan Bosman told VentureBeat that the virtual assistant’s primary goal is to help front-office equity sales and traders gain client insights and research.\n\n“The first version of this began as a pilot, which we then subsequently scaled,” Bosman said. “It’s really about accessing that equity research data that our analysts put out and bringing it to the hands of the sales team in a way that’s sales-friendly.”\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders.\n\nBuilding TD AI\n\nBosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team. Fortunately, the bank has a platform called TD Invent, where employees can bring ideas and the innovation leadership team can evaluate projects responsibly.\n\n“Someone in our equity research sales desk came in and pretty much said, I’ve got this idea and brought it to TD Invent,” Bosman said. “What I’ve loved most about this is when you build something super magical, you don’t need to go out and sell or put a face on it. Folks come in and say to us, ‘we want this, we need this or we’ve got ideas,’ and it’s truly the best when we’re able to bring our investment in data, cloud and infrastructure together.”\n\nTD Security built the TD AI virtual assistant by leveraging OpenAI’s GPT models. Bosman said TD worked with its technology teams and the Canadian AI company Layer 6, which the bank acquired in 2018, as well as with other strategic partnerships. The assistant integrates with the bank’s cloud infrastructure, allowing it to access internal research documents and market data, such as 13F filings and historical equity data.\n\nBosman calls TDS AI a Knowledge Management System, a term that generally encompasses its ability to retrieve, through retrieval augmented generation (RAG) processes, aggregate and synthesize information into “concise context-aware summaries and insights” so its sales teams can answer client questions.\n\nTD AI virtual assistant also gives users access to TD Bank’s foundation model, TD AI Prism.\n\nThe model, launched in June, is in use throughout the entire bank and not just for TD Securities. During the launch, the bank said TD AI Prism will improve the predictive performance of TD Bank’s applications by processing 100 times more data, replacing its single-architecture models and ensuring customer data stays internal.\n\n“The development posed unique challenges, as gen AI was relatively new to the organization when the initiative began, requiring careful navigation of governance and controls,” Bosman said. “Despite this, the project successfully brought together diverse teams across the enterprise, fostering collaboration to deliver a cutting-edge solution.”\n\nHe added that one of the standout features is its text-to-SQL capability, which converts natural language prompts into SQL queries.\n\nTo train the assistant, Bosman said TD Securities developed optimizations to make the process easier.\n\n“With patent-pending optimizations in prompt engineering and dynamic few-shot examples retrieval, we successfully achieved the business’s desired performance through context learning,” Bosman said. “As a result, fine-tuning the underlying OpenAI model was not required for interacting with both unstructured as well as tabular datasets.”\n\nBanks slowly entering the agentic era\n\nTD Bank and TD Securities, of course, are not the only banks interested in expanding from assistants to AI agents.\n\nBNY told VentureBeat that it began offering multi-agent solutions to its sales teams to help answer customer questions, such as those related to foreign currency support. Wells Fargo also saw an increase in the usage of its internal AI assistant. For its auto sales customers, Capital One built an agent that helps them sell more cars.\n\nMany of these use cases emerged after months of pilot testing, as is the case in every other industry; however, financial institutions have the additional burden of strict customer data privacy and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nTD Securities’ Bosman noted that many employees, even on the bank’s business side, are increasingly familiar with tools like ChatGPT. The challenge with pilot testing assistants and agents lies less in teaching them about the tools, but in establishing best practices for using the assistants, integrating them into existing workflows, understanding their limitations and how humans can provide feedback to mitigate hallucinations.\n\nEventually, Bosman said the assistant would evolve into something even its users outside of the bank would want to use when interacting with TD Securities.\n\n“My vision is that we see AI as something that can add value to us, but also to external customers at the bank. Right now, it’s a massive opportunity for us around driving a stronger client experience and delivering a better colleague experience,” Bosman said.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"teams\", \"bank\", \"securities\", \"sales\", \"realtime\", \"ai\", \"banks\", \"td\", \"openai\", \"insights\", \"assistant\", \"equity\", \"layer\", \"bosman\", \"trading\", \"taps\", \"data\"]", "content_hash": "64d075a75336c3ead8dd9feb23ff656adc3d01b49f7a17a45748a5a633d88430", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:40.165450+00:00"}
