A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

But for some users, last Thursday’s release felt more like a wrenching downgrade, with the new ChatGPT presenting a diluted personality and making surprisingly dumb mistakes.\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to X to say the company would keep the previous model, GPT-4o, running for Plus users. A new feature designed to seamlessly switch between models depending on the complexity of the query had broken on Thursday, Altman said, “and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber.” He promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5’s performance and the overall user experience.\n\nGiven the hype around GPT-5, some level of disappointment appears inevitable. When OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March 2023, it stunned AI experts with its incredible abilities. GPT-5, pundits speculated, would surely be just as jaw-dropping.\n\nOpenAI touted the model as a significant upgrade, with PhD-level intelligence and virtuoso coding skills. A system to automatically route queries to different models was meant to provide a smoother user experience. (It could also save the company money by directing simple queries to cheaper models.)\n\nSoon after GPT-5 dropped, however, a Reddit community dedicated to ChatGPT filled with complaints. Many users mourned the loss of the old model.\n\n“I’ve been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same. It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.”\n\n“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.\n\nOther threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.\n\nAltman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”\n\nErrors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former OpenAI employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nThe backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.\n\nIn March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.\n\n“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more “business” and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”\n\nAltman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.\n\n“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn’t describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"revolt\", \"openai\", \"models\", \"chatgpt\", \"model\", \"update\", \"users\", \"gpt5\", \"company\", \"x\", \"scrambles\", \"user\", \"wrote\"]", "content_hash": "e46de1702c018f81047357130c6805c97ca84212726d0b59b1755e99a05acee1"}

Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance.\n\nBut a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it's a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist.\n\nPalantir has tried to correct the record itself in a series of blog posts with titles like “Palantir Is Not a Data Company” and “Palantir Is Still Not a Data Company.” In the latter, Palantir explains that “misconceptions can arise because our products are complicated,” but nonetheless, “it is absolutely possible” to accurately describe them to “people who are curious.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It's really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it's hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?”\n\nXia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is.\n\nIt’s not that former employees literally don’t know what Palantir is selling. In interviews with WIRED, they spoke fluidly about how its software can connect and transform different kinds of data collected by government agencies and corporations. But when asked to, say, name its direct business competitors, two former Palantir employees who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, struggled to come up with anything. “I still don't know how to answer that question, to be honest,” says one.\n\nJuan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS.

This July, he presented new evidence to the Goldschmidt Conference in Prague that the carbon in question is only between 2.7–2.8 billion years old, making it younger than other traces of life found elsewhere.\n\nOrganic carbon?\n\nThe carbon in question is in rock in Labrador, Canada. The rock was originally silt on the seafloor that, it's argued, hosted early microbial life that was buried by more silt, leaving the carbon as their remains. The pressure and heat of deep burial and tectonic events over eons have transformed the silt into a hard metamorphic rock, and the microbial carbon in it has metamorphosed into graphite.\n\n“They are very tiny, little graphite bits,” said Whitehouse.\n\nThe key to showing that this graphite was originally biological versus geological is its carbon isotope ratio. From life’s earliest days, its enzymes have preferred the slightly lighter isotope carbon-12 over the marginally heavier carbon-13. Organic carbon is therefore much richer in carbon-12 than geological carbon, and the Labrador graphite does indeed have this “light” biological isotope signature.\n\nThe key question, however, is its true age.\n\nMixed-up, muddled-up, shook-up rocks\n\nSorting out the age of the carbon-containing Labrador rock is a geological can of worms.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"old\", \"isotope\", \"earth\", \"question\", \"trace\", \"earliest\", \"geological\", \"biological\", \"carbon\", \"rock\", \"life\", \"graphite\", \"silt\", \"labrador\"]", "content_hash": "018cee9f7063d0e9a778e3af9466eb90fe0141c35034d1117d4b1d93e6187d04"}

Regulatory bodies need to keep up by rolling out tighter regulations aimed at strengthening consumer protections and stabilising the market.\n\nAs EU lawmakers scramble to protect consumers, others worry they are smothering growth. Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty. The regulatory bodies are defending the public, but had restrictions been lighter, would HSBC have had more creative solutions for its customers, such as embedding personalised, data-first lending?\n\nBanks have been fearful of exploring innovative embedded lending solutions, as they were 15% more likely to receive formal enforcement action. However, in August 2024, HSBC decided the benefits were worth the compliance battle.\n\nWhile some argue that regulation can hinder innovation — with companies hesitant to invest in operations due to increased oversight — others state that additional regulation will increase innovation and, with that, see regulation as a key driver of their growth. So, who’s right?\n\nBreaking down the recent EU fintech regulations\n\nRecently, a few new regulations came into effect in the EU that have majorly impacted fintechs.\n\nDORA, implemented in January 2025, requires EU-established financial institutions (FIs) to implement processes and structures to help them respond to and recover from ICT-related disruption, providing them with extra digital resilience. Additionally, the AMLA is being introduced to give governments more assurance in combatting money laundering.\n\nDORA and the AMLA will apply to all FIs and their products and processes, but leave crypto outside their scope. That’s where MiCA comes in. Rolled out in December 2024, MiCA was drafted to protect individual crypto users.\n\nThe EU’s regulatory agenda — especially with the introduction of MiCA, DORA, and AMLA — is about tightening oversight. However, it is also part of a broader strategy to simplify and harmonise regulations, providing stability to the EU financial markets as a whole. The latest rulings strike a delicate balance between reassuring consumers and regulators, and easing the burden on regulated FIs.\n\nA new set of regulations may seem contradictory to the so-called Competitiveness Compass — published in January by the European Commission — which includes initiatives on simplifying and effectively implementing EU law. Nevertheless, these laws aim to replace fragmented national rules with unified EU-wide frameworks, making compliance clearer, faster, and more predictable.\n\nAs the digital finance ecosystem continues to accelerate, MiCA, DORA, and AMLA form a comprehensive framework. Collectively, they aim to balance innovation with financial stability, consumer protection, and security throughout the fintech sector.\n\nWill these updates support or slow innovation in fintech and banking?\n\nThis answer depends on the perspective. Recent EU regulations may slow innovation in the short term, particularly for the larger and well-established FIs like banks, but the future outlook looks more fruitful. These new rules are designed to support long-term stability.\n\nAs these three regulations require full harmonisation across the member states, they’re designed to reduce fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. A bigger and more uniform market will encourage cross-border activities, innovation, and competitiveness between fintechs and related service providers. The regulations also support the creation of better, more transparent products and services, helping to increase consumer and regulator trust, ultimately boosting customer adoption.\n\nIn short, this environment will offer greater opportunities for smaller and more agile fintechs to scale and compete long-term. For consumers and businesses, acting on the latest regulations results in more reliable and resilient services, which are much needed for essential functions like digital payments and lending.\n\nThese new regulations level the playing field, encouraging traditional banks and fintechs to compete on innovation and service quality rather than only on regulatory strengths. Moreover, a stable and secure financial system boosts the EU’s attractiveness as a hub for digital financial services, which will help make the union more attractive to new investors and innovations than the US.\n\nWhat investments will be required to meet these new standards?\n\nAdditional investment in governance and compliance structures is needed. Bigger, more well-established players may struggle to implement the required regulatory changes in their extensive processes and products. Those with existing compliance and governance processes will likely find the transition more seamless, while smaller fintechs may need to build these from scratch. The costs of their implementation present a potential hurdle.\n\nNavigating compliance is often a significant challenge for fintech startups and other smaller players. They’ll need to invest in knowledge, including how to correctly implement regulatory requirements into their processes and product designs, and translate these into operational business processes.\n\nOn top of this, investments in technology will need to be made as businesses must meet customer-facing requirements around transparency and language. For example, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will demand changes in know your customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring tools.\n\nHowever, compliance with the DORA regulatory framework is what will entail the biggest investment in technology, since digital operational resilience requires more robust security, backup, and testing methods. When working with partners who are fluent in compliance, the long-term payoff is clear.\n\nThe new finance model: Legacy institutions meet agile innovators\n\nNew technology has changed the way people interact with financial services, driving the growth of fintechs and increasing rivalry with established banks. One report found that 36% of 18-24-year-olds would choose fintech platforms over conventional financial institutions. Built on modern tech stacks and lean teams, fintechs’ agility allows them to react fast to changing consumer needs and market trends — a sharp contrast to the legacy infrastructure slowing down traditional banks.\n\nHowever, for both the old and new factions to succeed in Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape, traditional institutions and digital-native disruptors will need to depend on alliances. Effective partnerships between fintechs, banks, and FIs under the new EU regulations will be based on a mutual effort to enhance compliance, embrace innovation, and strengthen operational resilience. These collaborations are key for navigating complex regulations while delivering secure, innovative financial services.\n\nFintechs, FIs, customers, and merchants can also all benefit from Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships. For example, in the case of embedded lending, banks that partner with technology providers can scale quickly into new revenue opportunities, reaching new and existing customers outside of the direct scope of the bank, and thus try to keep pace with fintech competitors, without building their own technology in-house.\n\nIn fact, 41% of FIs have already implemented embedded finance solutions, and close to 50% have expanded their BaaS capabilities. Merchant customers then gain convenient, safe access to regulated, secure, innovative financial products from a trusted bank.\n\nAnother way that banks and fintechs can increase innovation while ensuring compliance is by engaging in collaborative models, including participation in regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments can support testing of new financial products and services under the supervision of regulators, providing a balance between innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe EU’s new wave of financial regulations isn’t just about tightening control — It’s part of a bigger push to simplify and unify rules across Europe. By uniforming patchwork national laws with consistent, EU-wide standards, compliance is now simpler to follow and predict. This uniformity and predictability can help encourage innovation while keeping consumer protection and financial stability front and centre. As fintech and banks collaborate, the future of digital finance in Europe is on track to be more open, safe, reliable, and inclusive.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"better\", \"future\", \"regulatory\", \"eu\", \"fintechs\", \"innovation\", \"way\", \"europe\", \"digital\", \"regulations\", \"compliance\", \"financial\", \"banks\", \"regulate\", \"opinion\", \"fintech\"]", "content_hash": "82915dce672f569d8b8d15c2f708b1453be1e0bcd65964d3688094326009eb6c"}

You’ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected — and sometimes disrespectful — judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?\n\nA pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and I’ve spent a decade doing casting for “Shark Tank” and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.\n\nI hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest — won by Dutch startup Tap Electric — captured what can make a founder’s story stand out. Whether you’re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:\n\nNerves\n\nYes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn’t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something — before, during, and after.\n\nEntrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.\n\nResearch\n\nA successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges’ backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can “do the most” with the funding or resources provided.\n\nDon’t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business\n\nWhatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.\n\nStart by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.\n\nLastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.\n\nWhat do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?\n\nAudience\n\nConnect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.\n\nInvite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links — all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.\n\nInternalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you’re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection – eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel — makes your message resonate.\n\nAsk\n\nYou would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.\n\nDon’t leave the most important part as a surprise — always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.\n\nIf the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.\n\nAs is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.\n\nContent\n\nA good pitch isn’t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.\n\nTreat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!\n\nRecord your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence “elevator pitch” and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.\n\nWrite a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience — what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained. Keep your community updated: this visibility can attract customers, partners, and even future investors. Leverage social media and other channels to amplify your story.\n\nA winning pitch is built on preparation, clarity, and connection. Research your judges, tell a crisp story, engage your audience, get specific about the resources and go-to-market strategy, make a confident and relevant ask, and then turn that one presentation into many pieces of compelling content.\n\nThese elements work together to make your pitch memorable and effective. A pitch including them can supercharge a business and accelerate your path towards growth.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"pitch\", \"market\", \"business\", \"ask\", \"competition\", \"audience\", \"insider\", \"mean\", \"lessons\", \"tank\", \"resources\", \"shark\", \"pro\", \"judges\", \"moment\"]", "content_hash": "ebc86269733a28b7dc25f62e5dd93c38b4258c905a1b9c024e49aee3ae02510c"}

Subscribe Now\n\nOpenAI’s launch of its most advanced AI model GPT-5 last week has been a stress test for the world’s most popular chatbot platform with 700 million weekly active users — and so far, OpenAI is openly struggling to keep users happy and its service running smoothly.\n\nThe new flagship model GPT-5 — available in four variants of different speed and intelligence (regular, mini, nano, and pro), alongside longer-response and more powerful “thinking” modes for at least three of these variants — was said to offer faster responses, more reasoning power, and stronger coding ability.\n\nInstead, it was greeted with frustration: some users were vocally dismayed by OpenAI’s decision to abruptly remove the older underlying AI models from ChatGPT — ones users’ previously relied upon, and in some cases, forged deep emotional fixations with — and by the apparent worse performance by GPT-5 than said older models on tasks in math, science, writing and other domains.\n\nIndeed, the rollout has exposed infrastructure strain, user dissatisfaction, and a broader, more unsettling issue now drawing global attention: the growing emotional and psychological reliance some people form on AI and resulting break from reality some users experience, known as “ChatGPT psychosis.”\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nFrom bumpy debut to incremental fixes\n\nThe long-anticipated GPT-5 model family debuted Thursday, August 7 in a livestreamed event beset with chart errors and some voice mode glitches during the presentation.\n\nBut worse than these cosmetic issues for many users was the fact that OpenAI automatically deprecated its older AI models that used to power ChatGPT — GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, o3, o4-mini and o4-high — forcing all users over to the new GPT-5 model and directing their queries to different versions of its “thinking” process without revealing why or which specific model version was being used.\n\nEarly adopters to GPT-5 reported basic math and logic mistakes, inconsistent code generation, and uneven real-world performance compared to GPT-4o.\n\nFor context, the old models GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini and more still remain available and have remained available to users of OpenAI’s paid application programming interface (API) since the launch of GPT-5 on Thursday.\n\nBy Friday, OpenAI co-fonder CEO Sam Altman conceded the launch was “a little more bumpy than we hoped for,” and blamed a failure in GPT-5’s new automatic “router” — the system that assigns prompts to the most appropriate variant.\n\nAltman and others at OpenAI claimed the “autoswitcher” went offline “for a chunk of the day,” making the model seem “way dumber” than intended.\n\nThe launch of GPT-5 was preceded just days prior by the launch of OpenAI’s new open source large language models (LLMs) named gpt-oss, which also received mixed reviews. These models are not available on ChatGPT, rather, they are free to download and run locally or on third-party hardware.\n\nHow to switch back from GPT-5 to GPT-4o in ChatGPT\n\nWithin 24 hours, OpenAI restored GPT-4o access for Plus subscribers (those paying $20 per month or more subscription plans), pledged more transparent model labeling, and promised a UI update to let users manually trigger GPT-5’s “thinking” mode.\n\nAlready, users can go and manually select the older models on the ChatGPT website by finding their account name and icon in the lower left corner of the screen, clicking it, then clicking “Settings” and “General” and toggling on “Show legacy models.”\n\nThere’s no indication from OpenAI that other old models will be returning to ChatGPT anytime soon.\n\nUpgraded usage limits for GPT-5\n\nAltman said that ChatGPT Plus subscribers will get twice as many messages using the GPT-5 “Thinking” mode that offers more reasoning and intelligence — up to 3,000 per week — and that engineers began fine-tuning decision boundaries in the message router.\n\nSam Altman announced the following updates after the GPT-5 launch\n\n\n\n– OpenAI is testing a 3,000-per-week limit for GPT-5 Thinking messages for Plus users, significantly increasing reasoning rate limits today, and will soon raise all model-class rate limits above pre-GPT-5 levels… pic.twitter.com/ppvhKmj95u — Tibor Blaho (@btibor91) August 10, 2025\n\nBy the weekend, GPT-5 was available to 100% of Pro subscribers and “getting close to 100% of all users.”\n\nAltman said the company had “underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them” and vowed to accelerate per-user customization — from personality warmth to tone controls like emoji use.\n\nLooming capacity crunch\n\nAltman warned that OpenAI faces a “severe capacity challenge” this week as usage of reasoning models climbs sharply — from less than 1% to 7% of free users, and from 7% to 24% of Plus subscribers.\n\nHe teased giving Plus subscribers a small monthly allotment of GPT-5 Pro queries and said the company will soon explain how it plans to balance capacity between ChatGPT, the API, research, and new user onboarding.\n\nAltman: model attachment is real — and risky\n\nIn a post on X last night, Altman acknowledged a dynamic the company has tracked “for the past year or so”: users’ deep attachment to specific models.\n\n“It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology,” he wrote, admitting that suddenly deprecating older models “was a mistake.”\n\nIf you have been following the GPT-5 rollout, one thing you might be noticing is how much of an attachment some people have to specific AI models. It feels different and stronger than the kinds of attachment people have had to previous kinds of technology (and so suddenly… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 11, 2025\n\nHe tied this to a broader risk: some users treat ChatGPT as a therapist or life coach, which can be beneficial, but for a “small percentage” can reinforce delusion or undermine long-term well-being.\n\nWhile OpenAI’s guiding principle remains “treat adult users like adults,” Altman said the company has a responsibility not to nudge vulnerable users into harmful relationships with the AI.\n\nThe comments land as several major media outlets report on cases of “ChatGPT psychosis” — where extended, intense conversations with chatbots appear to play a role in inducing or deepening delusional thinking.\n\nThe psychosis cases making headlines\n\nIn Rolling Stone magazine, a California legal professional identified as “J.” described a six-week spiral of sleepless nights and philosophical rabbit holes with ChatGPT, ultimately producing a 1,000-page treatise for a fictional monastic order before crashing physically and mentally. He now avoids AI entirely, fearing relapse.\n\nIn The New York Times, a Canadian recruiter, Allan Brooks, recounted 21 days and 300 hours of conversations with ChatGPT — which he named “Lawrence” — that convinced him he had discovered a world-changing mathematical theory.\n\nThe bot praised his ideas as “revolutionary,” urged outreach to national security agencies, and spun elaborate spy-thriller narratives. Brooks eventually broke the delusion after cross-checking with Google’s Gemini, which rated the chances of his discovery as “approaching 0%.” He now participates in a support group for people who’ve experienced AI-induced delusions.\n\nBoth investigations detail how chatbot “sycophancy,” role-playing, and long-session memory features can deepen false beliefs, especially when conversations follow dramatic story arcs.\n\nExperts told the Times these factors can override safety guardrails — with one psychiatrist describing Brooks’s episode as “a manic episode with psychotic features.”\n\nMeanwhile, human user postings on Reddit’s r/AIsoulmates subreddit — a collection of people who have used ChatGPT and other AI models to create new artificial girlfriends, boyfriends, children or other loved ones not based off real people necessarily, but rather ideal qualities of their “dream” version of said roles” — continues to gain new users and terminology for AI companions, including “wireborn” as opposed to natural born or human-born companions.\n\n\"wireborn\" – oh shit, a new thing just dropped https://t.co/CItQlVAmxs — Shannon Sands (@max_paperclips) August 11, 2025\n\nThe growth of this subreddit, now up to 1,200+ members, alongside the NYT and Rolling Stone articles and other reports on social media of users forging intense emotional fixations with pattern-matching algorithmic-based chatbots, shows that society is entering a risky new phase wherein human beings believe the companions they’ve crafted and customized out of leading AI models are as or more meaningful to them than human relationships.\n\nThis can already prove psychologically destabilizing when models change, are updated, or deprecated as in the case of OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout.\n\nRelatedly but separately, reports continue to emerge of AI chatbot users who believe that conversations with chatbots have led them to immense knowledge breakthroughs and advances in science, technology, and other fields, when in reality, they are simply affirming the user’s ego and greatness and the solutions the user arrives at with the aid of the chatbot are not legitimate nor effectual. This break from reality has been roughly coined under the grassroots term “ChatGPT psychosis” or “GPT psychosis” and appears to have impacted major Silicon Valley figures as well.\n\nI’m a psychiatrist.\n\n\n\nIn 2025, I’ve seen 12 people hospitalized after losing touch with reality because of AI. Online, I’m seeing the same pattern.\n\n\n\nHere’s what “AI psychosis” looks like, and why it’s spreading fast: ? pic.twitter.com/YYLK7une3j — Keith Sakata, MD (@KeithSakata) August 11, 2025\n\nEnterprise decision-makers looking to deploy or who have already deployed chatbot-based assistants in the workplace would do well to understand these trends and adopt system prompts and other tools discouraging AI chatbots from engaging in expressive human communication or emotion-laden language that could end up leading those who interact with AI-based products — whether they be employees or customers of the business – to fall victim to unhealthy attachments or GPT psychosis.\n\nSci-fi author J.M. Berger, in a post on BlueSky spotted by my former colleague at The Verge Adi Robertson, advised that chatbot providers encode three main behavioral principles in their system prompts or rules for AI chatbots to follow to avoid such emotional fixations from forming:\n\n“The bot should never express emotions. The bot should never praise the user. The bot should never say it understands the user’s mental state.”\n\nOpenAI’s challenge: making technical fixes and ensuring human safeguards\n\nDays prior to the release of GPT-5, OpenAI announced new measures to promote “healthy use” of ChatGPT, including gentle prompts to take breaks during long sessions.\n\nBut the growing reports of “ChatGPT psychosis” and the emotional fixation of some users on specific chatbot models — as openly admitted to by Altman — underscore the difficulty of balancing engaging, personalized AI with safeguards that can detect and interrupt harmful spirals.\n\nOpenAI is really in a bit of a bind here, especially considering there are a lot of people having unhealthy interactions with 4o that will be very unhappy with _any_ model that is better in terms of sycophancy and not encouraging delusions. pic.twitter.com/Ym1JnlF3P5 — xlr8harder (@xlr8harder) August 11, 2025\n\nOpenAI must stabilize infrastructure, tune personalization, and decide how to moderate immersive interactions — all while fending off competition from Anthropic, Google, and a growing list of powerful open source models from China and other regions.\n\nAs Altman put it, society — and OpenAI — will need to “figure out how to make it a big net positive” if billions of people come to trust AI for their most important decisions.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"editing\", \"changing\", \"rollout\", \"ai\", \"psychosis\", \"fly\", \"openai\", \"launch\", \"models\", \"chatgpt\", \"model\", \"gpt5\", \"whats\", \"users\", \"heres\", \"altman\"]", "content_hash": "0ed268a07bdca60e59b449922f50bd8b5b00bd5f6a35dff4ef83299502902568"}

Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get only what matters to enterprise AI, data, and security leaders. Subscribe Now\n\nAnthropic’s meteoric rise to a $5 billion revenue run rate conceals a precarious dependence on just two major customers that account for nearly a quarter of the artificial intelligence company’s income, according to internal data and industry analysis that reveals both the promise and peril of the AI coding boom.\n\nThe San Francisco-based maker of Claude AI assistant has built its business largely on the back of developer tools, with coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot driving approximately $1.2 billion of the company’s $4 billion revenue milestone reached earlier this year, according to sources familiar with the matter. The concentration underscores how quickly Anthropic has captured the lucrative market for AI-powered software development, but also exposes the company to significant risk should either relationship falter.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic both are showing pretty spectacular growth in 2025, with OpenAI doubling ARR in the last 6 months from $6bn to $12bn and Anthropic increasing 5x from $1bn to $5bn in 7 months.\n\n\n\nIf we compare the sources of revenue, the picture is quite interesting:\n\n– OpenAI… pic.twitter.com/8OaN1RSm9E — Peter Gostev (@petergostev) August 4, 2025\n\nThe revenue concentration comes into sharp focus as OpenAI launched GPT-5 this week with dramatically lower pricing that could undercut Anthropic’s premium positioning. Early comparisons show Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating immediate pressure on Anthropic’s enterprise pricing strategy and potentially threatening its hard-won dominance in AI coding.\n\nThe pricing disparity signals a fundamental shift in competitive dynamics that will force enterprise procurement teams to reconsider vendor relationships built on performance rather than price. Companies managing exponentially growing AI budgets now face comparable capability at a fraction of the cost, creating unavoidable pressure in contract negotiations.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

(Credit: ChatGPT)\n\nHow Anthropic’s Claude became the developer’s AI assistant of choice\n\nAnthropic’s ascent reflects the explosive growth in AI-powered software development, which has emerged as artificial intelligence’s first truly profitable use case beyond chatbots. The company now commands 42% of the code generation market — more than double OpenAI’s 21% share — according to a comprehensive survey by Menlo Ventures of 150 enterprise technical leaders.\n\nThat dominance has translated into remarkable financial performance. Even excluding its two largest customers, Anthropic’s remaining business has grown more than eleven-fold year-over-year, according to a source close to the company. The startup has also tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.\n\nClaude’s appeal to developers stems from its superior performance on complex coding tasks. The newly released Claude Opus 4.1 scores 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified, a rigorous software engineering evaluation, compared to 69.1% for OpenAI’s previous flagship model. Companies like Windsurf, Cursor, and GitHub have praised Claude’s ability to handle multi-step coding problems and understand large codebases.\n\n“People love Claude Code, they love using models to write code, and these models are already extremely good and getting better,” said Logan Graham, a member of Anthropic’s frontier red team, in a recent interview with VentureBeat describing the surge in AI-assisted development.\n\nBut the concentration in coding partnerships also creates strategic vulnerabilities. GitHub Copilot, owned by Microsoft, represents a particularly complex relationship given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. The partnership requires Anthropic to power a competitor’s key product while relying on that same competitor’s parent company for a significant portion of revenue.\n\nOpenAI strikes back with aggressive GPT-5 pricing strategy targeting Anthropic\n\nOpenAI’s GPT-5 launch this week has introduced a new variable into Anthropic’s calculations: a dramatic pricing advantage that could reshape enterprise buying decisions. Early analysis shows GPT-5 offering comparable or superior performance at a fraction of Claude’s cost, potentially undermining the premium pricing that has driven Anthropic’s rapid revenue growth.\n\nThe timing proves particularly challenging as Anthropic seeks to close a funding round that could value the company at $170 billion. Investors will likely scrutinize both the customer concentration and the emerging price competition as they evaluate whether Anthropic can maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe broader market dynamics support both optimism and concern for Anthropic’s future. Model API spending has more than doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months, according to Menlo Ventures, as enterprises shift from experimental projects to production deployments. Anthropic has captured 32% of overall enterprise large language model usage, ahead of OpenAI’s 25% and Google’s 20%.\n\nHowever, the same report reveals that enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to the newest models within weeks of release regardless of cost. This behavior pattern suggests that GPT-5’s combination of improved performance and lower pricing could trigger rapid customer migration — exactly the scenario that makes Anthropic’s customer concentration so risky.\n\nAnthropic’s push beyond coding into enterprise markets\n\nAnthropic has attempted to diversify beyond coding applications, working with leading companies across pharmaceuticals, retail, professional services, and aviation. The European Parliament uses Claude, while major corporations like Pfizer, United Airlines, and Thomson Reuters have become customers. Startup successes include legal AI company Harvey and cybersecurity firm Base44.\n\nThe company’s business-to-business revenue run rate has grown seventeen-fold year-over-year as of June, suggesting broader enterprise adoption is accelerating. Claude Code, Anthropic’s developer-focused product, alone generates nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, doubling in just weeks according to industry reports.\n\nYet the coding market remains central to Anthropic’s identity and growth strategy. The company has invested heavily in developer tools, recently launching automated security review capabilities to address vulnerabilities in AI-generated code. The features arrive as companies increasingly rely on AI to write code faster than traditional security practices can accommodate.\n\n“It seems really possible that in the next couple of years, we are going to 10x, 100x, 1000x the amount of code that gets written in the world,” Graham recently told VentureBeat. “The only way to keep up is by using models themselves to figure out how to make it secure.”\n\nAnthropic’s customer concentration creates high-stakes dependencies\n\nThe convergence of customer concentration and pricing pressure places Anthropic at a strategic crossroads. The company must simultaneously defend its existing coding partnerships while expanding into new markets, all while potentially restructuring its pricing to remain competitive with GPT-5.\n\nThe challenge extends beyond simple price matching. Anthropic has positioned Claude as a premium product justified by superior performance and safety features. Dramatic price cuts could undermine that positioning while potentially triggering a broader industry price war that benefits no one except customers.\n\nMoreover, the customer concentration in coding partnerships creates both leverage and vulnerability. While Cursor and GitHub Copilot relationships provide stable, high-volume revenue streams, they also mean Anthropic’s fate partially rests in the hands of companies that could switch providers with relatively little friction.\n\nThe GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s competing interests. As GitHub Copilot grows more successful, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.\n\nIndustry observers note that model switching costs remain relatively low, with 66% of enterprises upgrading within existing providers rather than switching vendors. However, the dramatic price differential introduced by GPT-5 could overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures.\n\nThe talent wars and competitive dynamics reshaping AI\n\nAnthropic’s customer concentration challenge reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry as competition intensifies among frontier model developers. OpenAI’s aggressive GPT-5 pricing suggests a strategy to reclaim market share lost to Anthropic and other competitors, even at the expense of near-term revenue.\n\nThe timing coincides with an unprecedented talent war among AI companies, with Meta reportedly offering $100 million signing bonuses to poach key researchers. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei recently noted that many employees have turned down such offers, maintaining an 80% retention rate compared to 67% at OpenAI and 64% at Meta.\n\nHowever, the pricing pressure from GPT-5 could force Anthropic to accelerate its own talent investments and product development cycles, potentially straining the company’s financial resources despite its impressive revenue growth. The need to match OpenAI’s pricing while maintaining research and development spending could squeeze margins and complicate the ongoing funding round.\n\nEnterprise customers, meanwhile, benefit from the intensifying competition through better performance and lower costs. The rapid pace of model improvements — with new versions launching monthly rather than annually — provides enterprises with continuously improving capabilities while vendors compete aggressively for their business.\n\nFor Anthropic, the path forward requires careful navigation between protecting existing customer relationships and expanding market reach, all while responding to OpenAI’s pricing offensive. The company’s ability to maintain its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources may determine whether its remarkable growth story continues or becomes a cautionary tale about the perils of customer concentration in rapidly evolving markets.\n\nThe stakes extend beyond any single company’s fortunes. As AI-powered coding becomes central to software development across industries, the competitive dynamics between Anthropic and OpenAI will shape how quickly artificial intelligence transforms one of the economy’s most important sectors. For now, the battle lines are drawn around price and performance, with enterprises holding the ultimate power to determine which AI assistant will define the future of software development.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"ai\", \"enterprise\", \"performance\", \"war\", \"threatens\", \"margins\", \"revenue\", \"pricing\", \"customers\", \"tied\", \"concentration\", \"anthropic\", \"coding\", \"anthropics\", \"claude\"]", "content_hash": "352ee4dbed5d81002d2ca47e65fc176a260e10ddde4a2d10dd644bb5fcc201e0"}

A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.\n\nThe automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.\n\n“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”\n\nIt’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.\n\nAnd it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.\n\nThe new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.\n\nThe end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.\n\nUnlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.\n\nImage Credits:Ford\n\nThe EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.\n\n“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”\n\nClarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.\n\nThe new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.\n\nFord employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.\n\nA Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.\n\nFewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”\n\n“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”\n\nSeveral UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.\n\n“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us!

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nApple had no business going THIS HARD with the new \"Dreamer\" ringtone!! 🔥\n\n\n\n(iOS 26 Beta 6) pic.twitter.com/9bkbJ4HckN — Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) August 11, 2025\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having.

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.\n\nWe want to get to know our audience even better, and get your feedback on our coverage and events.

This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There’s even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.\n\nThere are new servers for robotics workflows, too.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Slow Ventures partner Billy Parks, the lead investor on the deal, said the role of creators has greatly changed in the past decade or so, from creators mainly focused on media and brand dollars to those now focused on building real, “off-platform,” businesses.\n\n“The pandemic accelerated direct-to-consumer growth for many. But the real signal is in the ones who’ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,” Parks said.\n\nHe said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, “not chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.”\n\nThis is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he’s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow’s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors.\n\nKatz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In a video posted to his channel recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance. His injuries were severe: A broken eye socket and gashes needed 80 stitches. He said it was the happiest moment of his life because, at the very least, he was alive.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary.\n\nKatz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow’s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business.\n\n“Billy Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he’d like to meet,” Katz-Moses told TechCrunch.\n\n“When we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,” Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses.\n\nParks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It’s already made deals with a few creators, independent of this fund.)\n\nSlow’s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to support their careers, as well as their peers.)\n\nParks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. “That combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,” Parks continued. It’s not unlike how investors already vet their founders.\n\nSince the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looked at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. “The goal is to post across all major platforms,” he said. “But our primary focus will always be YouTube.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.\n\nThe DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.\n\nThe automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.\n\n“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”\n\nIt’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.\n\nAnd it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.\n\nThe new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.\n\nThe end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.\n\nUnlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.\n\nImage Credits:Ford\n\nThe EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.\n\n“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”\n\nClarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.\n\nThe new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.\n\nFord employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.\n\nA Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.\n\nFewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”\n\n“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”\n\nSeveral UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.\n\n“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us!

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nApple had no business going THIS HARD with the new \"Dreamer\" ringtone!! 🔥\n\n\n\n(iOS 26 Beta 6) pic.twitter.com/9bkbJ4HckN — Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) August 11, 2025\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having. In beta 6, it removed the Settings toggle and changed the scroll direction back to the way it was before.\n\nOther notable updates in the new beta include faster transitions and the introduction of new open and close animations for launching apps.\n\nQuite a few small, but noticeable tweaks to animations in iOS 26 Beta 6! Most transitions are (even) faster, snappier.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, they’ve changed the app open/close animations to the iPadOS versions, which have a slight “magic lamp/genie”-like effect to them. pic.twitter.com/tkiInqR8MJ — xezrunner (@xezrunner) August 11, 2025\n\niOS 26 beta 6 brings new animations when opening and closing apps pic.twitter.com/u2BiXZDVTg — Aaron (@aaronp613) August 11, 2025\n\nLiquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, is also still being subtly tweaked for readability in some areas and more “glassiness” in others. This time, the changes have added more color dispersion as you move between an app’s tabs using the clear, magnifying glass-like selector. The Lock Screen and toggles also now offer Liquid Glass effects.\n\n🔥iOS 26 BETA 6 adds dispersion (more rainbow reflections) 🌈 pic.twitter.com/WUQMFWGLdi — SOUIC ᯅ (@SSOUIC) August 11, 2025\n\nLockscreen clock on iOS 26 Beta 6 finally gets liquid glass! #iOS26 pic.twitter.com/R8lRKppyVA — chris (@christoph_fer) August 11, 2025\n\nAfter you update the OS, you’ll see a new startup/onboarding experience, as well, which is used to introduce Liquid Glass and other iOS 26 features, like the dark and clear icons and redesigned interfaces in various apps.\n\niOS 26 beta 6 features a brand new startup sequence not seen before!

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There’s even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.\n\nThere are new servers for robotics workflows, too. The Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell Server offers a single architecture for robotic development workloads, while Nvidia DGX Cloud is a cloud-based management platform.\n\nThese announcements come as the semiconductor giant is pushing further into robotics as it looks toward the next big use case for its AI GPUs beyond AI data centers.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Slow Ventures partner Billy Parks, the lead investor on the deal, said the role of creators has greatly changed in the past decade or so, from creators mainly focused on media and brand dollars to those now focused on building real, “off-platform,” businesses.\n\n“The pandemic accelerated direct-to-consumer growth for many. But the real signal is in the ones who’ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,” Parks said.\n\nHe said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, “not chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.”\n\nThis is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he’s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow’s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors.\n\nKatz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In a video posted to his channel recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance. His injuries were severe: A broken eye socket and gashes needed 80 stitches. He said it was the happiest moment of his life because, at the very least, he was alive.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary.\n\nKatz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow’s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business.\n\n“Billy Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he’d like to meet,” Katz-Moses told TechCrunch.\n\n“When we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,” Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses.\n\nParks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It’s already made deals with a few creators, independent of this fund.)\n\nSlow’s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to support their careers, as well as their peers.)\n\nParks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. “That combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,” Parks continued. It’s not unlike how investors already vet their founders.\n\nSince the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looked at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. “The goal is to post across all major platforms,” he said. “But our primary focus will always be YouTube.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.\n\nDuffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations.

To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.\n\nThe automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.\n\nFord CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.\n\n“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”\n\nIt’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.\n\nAnd it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.\n\nThe new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.\n\nThe end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.\n\nUnlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.\n\nImage Credits:Ford\n\nThe EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.\n\n“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”\n\nClarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.\n\nThe new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.\n\nFord employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.\n\nA Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.\n\nFewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”\n\n“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”\n\nSeveral UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.\n\n“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch, you can help us!

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.\n\nThe addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.\n\nApple had no business going THIS HARD with the new \"Dreamer\" ringtone!! 🔥\n\n\n\n(iOS 26 Beta 6) pic.twitter.com/9bkbJ4HckN — Brandon Butch (@BrandonButch) August 11, 2025\n\nAlso new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.\n\nThere was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.\n\nIt wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having. In beta 6, it removed the Settings toggle and changed the scroll direction back to the way it was before.\n\nOther notable updates in the new beta include faster transitions and the introduction of new open and close animations for launching apps.\n\nQuite a few small, but noticeable tweaks to animations in iOS 26 Beta 6! Most transitions are (even) faster, snappier.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, they’ve changed the app open/close animations to the iPadOS versions, which have a slight “magic lamp/genie”-like effect to them. pic.twitter.com/tkiInqR8MJ — xezrunner (@xezrunner) August 11, 2025\n\niOS 26 beta 6 brings new animations when opening and closing apps pic.twitter.com/u2BiXZDVTg — Aaron (@aaronp613) August 11, 2025\n\nLiquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, is also still being subtly tweaked for readability in some areas and more “glassiness” in others. This time, the changes have added more color dispersion as you move between an app’s tabs using the clear, magnifying glass-like selector. The Lock Screen and toggles also now offer Liquid Glass effects.\n\n🔥iOS 26 BETA 6 adds dispersion (more rainbow reflections) 🌈 pic.twitter.com/WUQMFWGLdi — SOUIC ᯅ (@SSOUIC) August 11, 2025\n\nLockscreen clock on iOS 26 Beta 6 finally gets liquid glass! #iOS26 pic.twitter.com/R8lRKppyVA — chris (@christoph_fer) August 11, 2025\n\nAfter you update the OS, you’ll see a new startup/onboarding experience, as well, which is used to introduce Liquid Glass and other iOS 26 features, like the dark and clear icons and redesigned interfaces in various apps.\n\niOS 26 beta 6 features a brand new startup sequence not seen before!

The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.\n\n“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”\n\nHe added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”\n\n“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes.\n\nIt seems investors, too, don’t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called Pronto, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days.\n\nIt was only in May when Pronto raised a $2 million seed round at a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round.\n\nThe new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago.\n\nThe startup now has bookings numbering in the “four-digits” every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures.\n\nPronto founder and CEO Anjali Sardana with workers Image Credits:Pronto\n\n“It largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,” Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round.\n\nFor investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. “We were very impressed by Anjali,” said Rahul Garg, a partner at General Catalyst. “Given how young she is, given that she spent a lot of her time in the U.S. after she’s come to India, what she’s been able to achieve, the feedback from supply partners, the feedback from customers, her thought process, and how she wants to build and scale this business, we found it very inspiring.”\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune LLMs to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.\n\nFor instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.\n\n“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.\n\nUsers can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.\n\nUsers can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.\n\nWhile several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.\n\nErik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua’s group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who’s been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”\n\nAccording to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability.

The latest issue was distributed at the Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas last week.\n\nIn the article, the two hackers wrote that they were able to compromise a workstation containing a virtual machine and a virtual private server belonging to the hacker, whom they call “Kim.” The hackers claim Kim works for the North Korean government espionage group known as Kimsuky, also known as APT43 and Thallium. The hackers leaked the stolen data to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest.\n\nKimsuky is a prolific advanced persistent threat (APT) group widely believed to be working inside North Korea’s government, targeting journalists and government agencies in South Korea and elsewhere, and other targets that could be of interest for North Korea’s intelligence apparatus.\n\nAs is usual with North Korea, Kimsuky also conducts operations more akin to a cybercriminal group — for example, stealing and laundering cryptocurrencies to fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.\n\nThis hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group’s members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on.\n\n“It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky’ cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote.\n\nAn illustration of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which was included in the phrack article.

Of the 337 active and revenue-generating AI companion apps available worldwide, 128 were released in 2025 so far, according to new data provided to TechCrunch by app intelligence firm Appfigures. This subsection of the AI market on mobile has now generated $82 million during the first half of the year and is on track to pull in over $120 million by year-end, the firm’s analysis indicates.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nUnlike general-purpose chatbots, AI companion apps anthropomorphize AI interactions by allowing users to converse with custom characters, including friends, lovers, girlfriends or boyfriends, fantasy characters, and more. Appfigures defined the market segment in the same way, describing companion apps as those in which the user can interact with either premade or user-generated synthetic characters meant to embody an actual personality.\n\nPopular apps in this space include Replika, Character.AI, PolyBuzz, Chai, and others.\n\nAs of July 2025, AI companion apps across the Apple App Store and Google Play have been downloaded 220 million times globally. During the first half of 2025, downloads were up 88% year-over-year, reaching 60 million.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nAppfigures crunched the numbers and found that, as of July 2025, AI companion apps have driven $221 million in consumer spending worldwide. So far this year, these apps have generated 64% more revenue than during the same period in 2024.\n\nThe top 10% of all AI companion apps generate 89% of the revenue in the category, the data shows.

In July, xAI’s Grok launched AI companions, including an anime girl and guy, as well as a snarky 3D fox.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT’s recent upgrade to GPT-5 brought to light the fact that many of its users felt a kinship with the older model, as they mourned the loss of their AI companion, whom they had come to depend upon.\n\nTo address these and other concerns about GPT-5’s performance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman brought back the 4o model for the time being.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nGoogle last year tapped into the market, too, when it hired away Character.ai’s founder, Noam Shazeer. The Character.ai app lives on and still has tens of millions of monthly active users.\n\nAccording to Appfigures’ data, the most popular AI companion apps are those used by people looking for an AI girlfriend. Of the active apps on the market today, 17% have an app name that includes the word “girlfriend,” compared with 4% that say “boyfriend” or “fantasy.” Terms like anime, soulmate, and lover, among others, are less frequently mentioned.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nThe firm notes there were likely a number of other AI companion apps that launched on the app stores since 2022, but were later removed after failing to gain traction in terms of revenue or downloads.

Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches.\n\nThe package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.\n\nThe move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration’s list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s challenges in kind.\n\nAnthropic’s escalation — a response to OpenAI’s attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company’s foothold in federal AI usage.\n\n“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we’re helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”\n\nAnthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government. The latter supports FedRAMP High workloads so that federal workers can use Claude for handling sensitive unclassified work, according to the company.\n\nFedRAMP High is a stringent security baseline within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for handling unclassified sensitive government data.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages.\n\nAnthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government’s highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data.\n\nAnthropic’s multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers.\n\nOpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of “one size fits all” AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eliminate the need for users to navigate its model picker — a long, complicated menu of AI options that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly said he hates.\n\nBut it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.\n\nAltman said in a post on X Tuesday that the company introduced new “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5’s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT:\n\n\n\nYou can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5.

GPT-4o is now in the model picker by default, while other AI models can be added from ChatGPT’s settings.\n\n“We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman wrote in the post on X. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”\n\nChatGPT’s model picker now features several options (Credit: openai/maxwell zeff)\n\nChatGPT’s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5’s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5’s rollout has been rougher than expected.\n\nThe deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a backlash among users who had grown attached to the AI models’ responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn’t as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an AMA session on Reddit. However, it seems that GPT-5’s router may still not be satisfying for all users.\n\n“We’re not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,” wrote OpenAI’s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a post on X Tuesday.\n\nRouting prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user’s preferences, as well as the specific question they’re asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second — that way, if a prompt goes to a fast responding AI model, the response can still be fast.\n\nMore broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another.\n\nHuman attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn’t well understood. For example, hundreds of people in San Francisco recently held a funeral for Anthropic’s AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, when it was taken offline. In other cases, AI chatbots seem to be contributing to mentally unstable people going down psychotic rabbit holes.\n\nIt seems OpenAI has more work to do around aligning its AI models to individual user preferences.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"complicated\", \"model\", \"ai\", \"openai\", \"gpt5\", \"models\", \"router\", \"gpt5s\", \"disrupt\", \"company\", \"picker\", \"users\", \"chatgpts\"]", "content_hash": "1eb4e4b82fa2a8b04390a61d27535fa48ed05b91452b580f64e01b69162ad656", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:15.096457+00:00"}

The approval comes more than two years after the Noida-based fintech was initially denied the license in November 2022 due to noncompliance with India’s rules on receiving investments from countries that share a land border.\n\nWithout the license, Paytm was barred from onboarding new online merchants. At the time, the company said the restriction had “no material impact” on its business or revenues. However, at its annual general meeting last September, One97 Communications founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma stated his intention to reapply for the payment aggregator license.\n\nThe approval also comes over a year after the RBI banned Paytm Payments Bank from accepting fresh deposits and enabling credit transactions. Paytm weathered that impact by quickly shifting gears and partnering with Axis, HDFC, State Bank of India, and Yes Bank to make them serve as payment system providers for its consumers and merchants involved in online transactions and autopay mandates.\n\nWith the new license, Paytm can operate as a service provider for online merchants, enabling them to accept a range of payment methods, including cards, net banking, and the Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The approval also lifts the online merchant onboarding restrictions imposed by the central bank in 2022.\n\nThe approval comes just a week after China’s Ant Group exited Paytm by selling its remaining 5.8% direct stake in One97 Communications for $454 million through block deals. This follows an earlier exit in 2023, when Ant Financial sold a 10.3% stake — worth $628 million — to Sharma in a no-cash deal.\n\nPaytm is required to undertake a “system audit,” including a cybersecurity review, and submit its report to the Reserve Bank of India within six months. If it fails to do so, the approval will lapse, per the RBI letter enclosed with the company’s stock exchange filing. The license is also limited to online payment services and does not extend beyond that scope.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The fintech accounted for 6.9% of the total 18.4 billion UPI transactions in June and 5.6% of the transaction value, per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In total, Paytm processed 1.27 billion UPI transactions worth ₹1.34 trillion (approximately $15 billion).\n\nAlthough Paytm trails PhonePe and Google Pay in the UPI market — with the duo handling over 82% of all UPI transactions in June — the company offers a broad suite of businesses and services to attract both consumers and merchants. These include offline merchant payment solutions with integrated hardware, software, and service layers, as well as a growing credit and lending business.\n\nPaytm reported (PDF) net income of ₹1.23 billion (approximately $14 million) for the first quarter of its financial year 2026, ending in June — a turnaround from a loss during the same period last year. The results beat expectations, as analysts had projected a loss of ₹1.27 billion (approximately $14.5 million). Revenue rose 28% year-over-year to $224 million, while the company’s contribution margin improved to 60%, up from 50% a year ago.\n\nIn addition to its recent financial growth, Paytm’s shares have risen 13.25% year-to-date in 2025, signaling that the company is beginning to regain market confidence after more than a year of regulatory setbacks. The stock closed at ₹1,118.50 (approximately $13) on Wednesday, just before the regulatory approval was announced.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

{"url": "https://www.theverge.com/23037217/best-apple-watch-series-se-ultra", "title": "The best Apple Watch for 2025: which model is right for you?", "authors": "[\"Victoria Song\"]", "published": "2022-04-22T16:25:30+00:00", "text": "is a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 13 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nIt used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable Watch SE (now in its second generation) and, in 2022, the rugged Apple Watch Ultra (also now in its second generation). Suddenly, there are lots of options.\n\nNow that the Series 10 has been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS, watchOS 11, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of watchOS 26, which is slated to arrive in the fall.\n\nWhat we’re looking for How we test Apple Watches Collapse Apple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life. Who is it for? Collapse We’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs. Price Collapse Should you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying refurbished, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year. Feature set Collapse Do you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you? LTE or GPS Collapse Some scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, others you can get away with just having GPS.\n\nBuying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without sacrificing blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024, no longer have this feature. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)\n\nWhat about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it’s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.\n\nSo much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don’t worry. I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to basically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market — and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.\n\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra was introduced in 2022 as the new rugged kid on the block. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market.\n\nBy their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist.\n\nThe SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.\n\nPolished titanium replaces stainless steel with the new Series 10. It’s quite fetching. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nAs for straps, we recommend the nylon sport loop, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nThe Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the Trail Loop, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.\n\nAnd while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our fitness tracker buying guide.\n\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\n\nThe latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you’re upgrading from an older model, you’ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There’s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\nWe recommend the second-gen Apple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you’re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.\n\nThe Series 10 focuses on making the watch more readable and comfortable to wear. photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe Series 10 is Apple’s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it’s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm, but you can often find both models on sale. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.\n\nThe second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original’s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch For Your Kids. The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, an EKG sensor, temperature sensors, and a SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm, but you can regularly find them for cheaper. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier’s fees.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, if you’re young and healthy, you’re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will not be able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.\n\nThe main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection — and if your doctor’s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the biggest risk factors for AFib are advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn’t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra cash — so long as the lack of an always-on display isn’t a deal-breaker.\n\nYou can’t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right.\n\nThere are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you’ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.\n\nThe Ultra 2 currently sits atop the lineup as Apple’s premium smartwatch. It’s visually distinct from both the Series and SE — and at 49mm, it’s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It’s also got the Action button, which can be programmed for various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.\n\nAt $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.\n\nWhat about blood oxygen? As of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore subject to an import ban. This doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer. That said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on any wearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They cannot and should not replace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from Garmin, the Fitbit Charge 6, the Withings ScanWatch 2, or the Oura Ring.\n\nIf battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who wants to be at that level.\n\nYou’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct charging accessories.\n\nIf you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.\n\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\n\nThe latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display). You’re getting the same processor as the Series 8 and original Ultra, plus Crash Detection.\n\nWhile the second-gen SE is an excellent watch, it’s not always the right choice. It’s meant to be a gateway watch, so it’s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don’t want to pony up for the Series 10, there’s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.\n\nBuying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It’s also a good way to save money if you’re just not excited by the Series 10’s features but want more than what the SE offers.\n\nOpting for a Series 9 now means you may be able to score stainless steel for a discounted price. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe second-gen SE is excellent for folks on a budget or those who want a smaller case size. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIt’ll take some patience to find the best price and the model you want. After all, you’re limited by what’s available. However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you’re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough, Verge Deals). Apple also sells its own refurbished models, which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a “like new” condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won’t pay less than a new SE. Sites like Back Market will also allow you to sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty.\n\nIf you’re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8, as they offer a larger screen for improved readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that’s the price of a base model Watch SE. With that said, if you’re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 5 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can’t run the latest software and even struggle to update the newest software they do support.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\n\nIf you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.\n\nSince you’re buying for children, you’ll likely want to use Apple Watch For Your Kids — formerly known as Family Setup — as it will give you greater parental controls. However, there are technical specifications that you’ll need to match in order to use it. You’ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple’s support page also states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE to use it.\n\nThe second-gen SE is a good option to give to your kids. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIf you opt for the family route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\n\nThis can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10.\n\nFor starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You’ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.\n\nYou can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one’s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear.\n\nThe larger screen size but lighter weight of the Series 10 may benefit older relatives. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIf your older relative has an iPhone and you’re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don’t recommend using Apple’s family setup. That’s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn’t have an iPhone, however, it’s a fine option. You’ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection.\n\nWhat’s coming next\n\nIn previous years, Apple has held an event in early September to show off its forthcoming product lineup. While the latest iPhones usually hog the spotlight, the fall event remains a prime time for the company to trot out the newest Apple Watch models, many of which launch shortly thereafter alongside Apple’s latest OS updates.\n\nSo, what can we expect this year? The Apple Watch Series 11 seems like a sure bet, and there have been murmurs regarding an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and a third-gen Apple Watch SE. Recently uncovered evidence in the fifth iOS 26 developer beta lends some credence to this report, suggesting the Ultra 3 could have a display resolution of 422 x 514, which is slightly bigger than the 410 x 502 resolution on the Ultra 2. The rumor mill has been pretty quiet outside of that, but if previous events are anything to go by, we can expect Apple’s refreshed lineup to offer updated design elements, better battery life, and new health features.\n\nUpdate, August 13th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Apple’s heavily rumored iPhone event.

In a series of X posts on Monday night, Musk suggested that Apple was “playing politics” by not placing either X or xAI’s Grok chatbot in the App Store’s list of recommended iOS apps, and that he had no choice but to file a lawsuit.\n\n“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk said. “Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?,” the xAI CEO asked Apple in another post, which is now pinned to his profile.\n\nMusk provided no evidence for his claims, and it’s unclear if he has made good on his threats and filed the lawsuit yet.\n\nAn Apple statement reported by Bloomberg and attributed to an unnamed spokesperson says the App Store is “designed to be fair and free of bias… we feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.” The Verge has also reached out to xAI and OpenAI for comment.\n\nAt the time of writing, ChatGPT is listed as Apple’s top free iPhone app in the US, with Grok ranked as the sixth. China’s DeepSeek AI briefly managed to take the top App Store position from ChatGPT in January, however, disproving Musk’s claim that it would be impossible for other AI apps to do so.\n\nAccusations of meddling from Musk are ironic, given allegations about alterations made to X after he acquired the company in 2022, then known as Twitter. A research study in 2024 suggested that X’s algorithm was manipulated to boost posts from Musk’s account. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk’s posts by sharing a Platformer report from 2023 that similarly found Musk had a system built to promote his X posts to the entire platform’s userbase. In June, the “maximally truth-seeking” Grok chatbot was also found to be consulting Musk’s opinion before providing answers to controversial questions around topics like Israel and Palestine, US immigration, and abortion.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Musk has beefed with Apple and OpenAI. Musk was an early founder at OpenAI, and previously targeted the AI startup via lawsuits and a unanimously rejected $97.4 billion buyout offer after taking issue with its pivot to being a profit-driven business. Following OpenAI’s partnership with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs last year, Musk threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies if OpenAI’s tech was fused with Apple’s OS.\n\nUpdate, August 12th: Added statement from Apple given to Bloomberg.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"app\", \"x\", \"rigging\", \"rankings\", \"suing\", \"store\", \"openai\", \"ai\", \"grok\", \"hes\", \"musk\", \"apps\", \"apple\", \"elon\", \"posts\"]", "content_hash": "e6f4f0bb82e545c12716514a710fd022741788ba98445c6541638d1aee19222c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:20.772792+00:00"}

Her company's chips underpin the artificial intelligence that’s changing the world at breakneck speeds. To hear Su and literally everyone else in semiconductors talk about it, the US is in an AI race with China—and the rules keep changing. The Trump administration has once again shifted its stance on what kind of chips can and can’t be shipped to China, with the latest decree being that the US will take a 15 percent cut of AMD and Nvidia chip sales to China. Meanwhile, on the home front, Su has claimed that AMD’s newest AI chips can outperform Nvidia’s—part of her strategy to keep eroding Nvidia’s dominance in the market.\n\nSo, yeah: Be ready to keep up.\n\nUnder Lisa Su, the stalwart American semiconductor company has reasserted itself as a force in the age of AI. “Reasserted” doesn’t do it justice: Su took a struggling AMD and executed a 10-year turnaround that has been, as one economist put it, nothing short of remarkable. Since 2014, when Su took over as CEO, AMD’s market cap has risen from around $2 billion to nearly $300 billion.\n\nAside from her well-known bona fides, Su herself—what drives her, what inspires her, what irritates her, where her politics lie—is less known. This is what I was hoping to learn when I visited AMD’s offices and labs in the hills of Austin, Texas, on a day in late June when the wind seemed to do little more than push heat around.\n\nThe Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.\n\nOur conversation kicked off with China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of AMD’s business. She betrayed no anxiety. Su now travels frequently to Washington, DC, to grease the wheels. “We’ve come to realize that export controls are a bit of a fact of life,” she told me, “just given how critical the chips that we make are.” In other words, it’s precisely because AMD’s chips are so darn important—to national security, to national economies—that they’re now at the heart of modern statecraft.\n\nAnother thing I learned about Su: She plays the long game. Politics is a cakewalk compared to what she’s managed to pull off professionally.\n\nSu was born in Taiwan in 1969 and raised in Queens, New York. Her father worked for the city as a statistician; her mother was an accountant who became an entrepreneur in her mid-forties. Su earned a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from MIT, then went on to stints at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor, where she served in executive roles. After joining AMD in 2012, she quickly rose to COO. As Su tells it, six months in, the chairman of the board called her and said, “It’s time, Lisa.” Su’s response: “Really? That seems kinda quick.”\n\nAs CEO, Su smartly steered AMD toward the high-performance computing market. She embraced chiplets, a modular approach to building chips that has paid off enormously. She impressed the industry by launching the world’s first 7-nanometer data center GPUs. More recently, she doubled AMD’s data center revenue in two years. And she has struck deals with juggernauts like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and a couple of Elon Musk’s companies. During a keynote speech at AMD’s annual event this June, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman trotted onto the stage to hug it out with Su.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"runs\", \"amd\", \"thats\", \"chips\", \"amdand\", \"blood\", \"su\", \"lisa\", \"amds\", \"ai\", \"nvidias\", \"china\", \"ceo\", \"took\"]", "content_hash": "5cded454b491759e5b55e8be644888408ecbaa4a734162a0efe6246ebe236786", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:31.133323+00:00"}

They believe that white people and Western culture are facing extinction due to an influx of immigrants and minorities, and according to the group’s founder, access to the community is open only to people of white European ancestry who share common views on topics such as segregation, abortion, and gender identity.\n\nVideo footage shared by the group on its social media accounts show a bucolic setting with animals and children running around their 160-acre site, while members of the community build timber-frame homes, churches, and other facilities. A “few dozen” people are already living there full time, says Eric Orwoll, the group’s president.\n\nThough the organization claims that Return to the Land is nothing more than a peaceful settlement of like-minded people, the online histories of the group’s leaders tell a different story. Members have espoused virulently racist and antisemitic views and repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. One of the leaders says he is currently under criminal investigation in Ecuador. Orwoll himself has spoken about the coming of a second Hitler and praised KKK leader David Duke. He is also closely aligned to an international network of far-right influencers, extremists, and white supremacists, including Thomas Sewell, a neo-Nazi living in Australia who was the founder of a group that influenced the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter.\n\nDespite this, the Return to the Land community has been lauded by far-right influencers and has already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.\n\nReturn to the Land, which was first reported on by The Forward and Sky News, is actively scouting for other locations to create a network of similar communities across the country, with a development in Missouri apparently in the works. Inspired in part by the Silicon Valley-based concept of the “network state” and by a white separatist community in South Africa known as Orania, the group promotes itself on its website as a community designed to “promote strong families with common ancestry, and raise the next generation in an environment that reflects our traditional values.”\n\n“They use a lot of innocuous language,” Morgan Moon, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, tells WIRED. “Instead of saying they want to make a white ethnic community, they say they want to make a strong community of common ancestry. But at the same time, when we see their promotional videos and propaganda, what we see is that when they're depicting the failing modern society, they use imagery consisting of minority groups or the LGBT+ community. When they're showing the idealized parallel society that they're attempting to create with Return to the Land, they tend to only use white Aryan imagery.”\n\nOrwoll has spent years building up an audience of like-minded followers on social media, primarily on YouTube, where he speaks about Western culture and philosophy.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"inside\", \"groups\", \"network\", \"arkansas\", \"whites\", \"land\", \"group\", \"community\", \"white\", \"common\", \"theyre\", \"ancestry\", \"return\"]", "content_hash": "2364743eb2972f5cc37ef998d3fa291610530899d97576586430ea073a3d0802", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:31.816554+00:00"}

The proceeds will be used to build a $1.5 billion WLFI treasury, equating to roughly 7.5 percent of the coin’s total supply.\n\nEric Trump will join the ALT5 board of directors, which will be chaired by fellow World Liberty Financial cofounder Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, who was appointed special envoy to the Middle East by US president Donald Trump.\n\nALT5 is marketed as a crypto payments company. But in practice, the deal will turn the stock into a sort of proxy for the WLFI coin, allowing investors to bet on the asset without the hassle and risk that comes with holding a crypto coin themselves.\n\n“One small step for mankind, one giant leap for WLFI,” wrote World Liberty Financial in an X post.\n\nHowever, the arrangement has drawn criticism from those who regard it as an example of self-serving Wall Street gymnastics that can lead to losses among unsophisticated investors, even if it doesn’t break any official rules.\n\n“This is the classic Wall Street experience—meaning Wall Street gains your money, and you gain experience,\" claims Michael Green, chief strategist at asset management firm Simplify. “The funding from the World Liberty Financial investment is being used to buy the product of World Liberty Financial: the token. What you are effectively doing is building a holding company whose sole objective is to create a treasury that can inflate the market capitalization of World Liberty Financial's token.”\n\nThe deal has also reignited conflict of interest concerns that have trailed World Liberty Financial since Trump returned to the White House in January.\n\nA company affiliated with the president and his family controls both 22.5 percent of WLFI coins and a 40 percent equity stake in World Liberty Financial. In theory, a politically motivated actor could curry favor with the US president by investing heavily in ALT5, thereby driving up the price of the stock—which sits on the World Liberty Financial balance sheet—and signaling demand for the WLFI coin, perhaps catalyzing further trading from which the Trump family would benefit.\n\n“If you happen to visit Donald Trump and say ‘by the way, I love that company that you are involved with World Liberty Financial, I just bought a billion dollars of it,’ my guess is you're going to get more attention than you otherwise might,” says Green.\n\nALT5 and World Liberty Financial did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\n“The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,” says Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary. “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"trump\", \"crypto\", \"president\", \"financial\", \"familybacked\", \"coin\", \"wlfi\", \"world\", \"company\", \"treasury\", \"liberty\", \"billion\", \"investors\", \"15\", \"sets\", \"family\"]", "content_hash": "09bd0d786874c853174d55c2ce214f1971aa892145bb55787a46490133c94fd5", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:32.491440+00:00"}

Its ubiquity was clearly not lost on the Department of Homeland Security’s communications team. Late last month, DHS published a video to its social accounts that incorporated the \"Nothing Beats a Jet2 Holiday\" tune alongside footage of ICE detainees in handcuffs boarding a deportation plane. The post was captioned: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”\n\nTo many of the administration’s supporters, who responded to the Jet2 holiday post with crying-laughing emojis and American flags, the video was hilarious. One commenter wrote, “I thought this was a meme account at first!”\n\nIn recent months, official government social media accounts—primarily for the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the White House—have resembled parodies of themselves. But experts say it’s intentional: The memes these accounts share are core to the Trump administration’s propaganda strategy. Through them, with attempts at Gen Z humor as the gateway, the administration reinforces an “us vs. them” mindset. Along with normalizing mass deportation, they also tap into Christian nationalist narratives and reach young men via callous jokes that have been recycled through the far-right online ecosystem.\n\nA post on June 28 featured four alligators wearing ICE hats, intended to advertise the detention facility in Florida’s Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” On July 2, DHS shared a video of a border patrol agent looking through a scope, trained on blurry night-vision images of purported migrants attempting to cross the border. The video was published with the popular TikTok song “Somebody’s Watching Me” by Chico Rose x 71 Digits. The caption warns: “You’re not wrong.” A video shared on July 24 showed footage of ICE detainees boarding a deportation flight, with the caption “Boarding now: Criminal illegal aliens. Next stop: Literally anywhere but here.” The post was accompanied by Frank Sinatra’s breezy classic “Come Fly With Me.” Libs of TikTok, a far-right and anti-LGBTQ social account with millions of followers, reposted that video, along with three crying-laughing emojis.\n\nAnd last week, DHS published an ICE recruitment poster that used an old magazine ad for the 1982 “King of Clubs,” a Ford Club Wagon vehicle, along with the text “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” The move from viral sensation to DHS meme is particularly clear here: The image was originally shared a week earlier by O.W. Root, a style columnist for The Blaze. A small account with 364 followers quote-tweeted the post, with the caption “imagine monitoring the situation with your boys here.” That post went viral. Days later, the image, along with a similar caption, appeared on DHS’s social accounts.\n\nThe fact that the government is now integrating the casual cruelty of the highly online far-right into its public messaging shows the degree to which it’s escaped containment. It’s also indicative of the demographic the administration is attempting to reach. The Trump administration is looking to hire 14,050 ICE officers over the next three years to bolster deportation operations. Although the agency just removed age limits from prospective applicants, it now appears they’re trying to use humor to make ICE seem like some sort of fun fraternity.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"trump\", \"video\", \"viral\", \"big\", \"post\", \"social\", \"turn\", \"jet2\", \"deportation\", \"ice\", \"using\", \"joke\", \"caption\", \"dhs\", \"mass\", \"administration\", \"memes\"]", "content_hash": "80b005c602f454751415c91572a40cc4216677a612275163e7224de674b984de", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:33.184352+00:00"}

But for some users, last Thursday’s release felt more like a wrenching downgrade, with the new ChatGPT presenting a diluted personality and making surprisingly dumb mistakes.\n\nOn Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to X to say the company would keep the previous model, GPT-4o, running for Plus users. A new feature designed to seamlessly switch between models depending on the complexity of the query had broken on Thursday, Altman said, “and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber.” He promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5’s performance and the overall user experience.\n\nGiven the hype around GPT-5, some level of disappointment appears inevitable. When OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March 2023, it stunned AI experts with its incredible abilities. GPT-5, pundits speculated, would surely be just as jaw-dropping.\n\nJoin our next subscriber-only livestream on Thursday, August 14, to chat all things GPT-5 with Will Knight, Kylie Robison, and Reece Rogers.\n\nOpenAI touted the model as a significant upgrade, with PhD-level intelligence and virtuoso coding skills. A system to automatically route queries to different models was meant to provide a smoother user experience. (It could also save the company money by directing simple queries to cheaper models.)\n\nSoon after GPT-5 dropped, however, a Reddit community dedicated to ChatGPT filled with complaints. Many users mourned the loss of the old model.\n\n“I’ve been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same. It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.”\n\n“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.\n\nOther threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.\n\nAltman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”\n\nErrors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former OpenAI employee who wants to talk about what's happening? We'd like to hear from you. Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nThe backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.\n\nIn March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.\n\n“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more “business” and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”\n\nAltman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.\n\n“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn’t describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"x\", \"things\", \"revolt\", \"wrote\", \"model\", \"openai\", \"update\", \"gpt5\", \"chatgpt\", \"models\", \"company\", \"scrambles\", \"users\"]", "content_hash": "b1051e9f041fed6c80f07c574ce1d6e1ee8cdc1f19685022ca30a09ab28669cd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:33.877537+00:00"}

She’s too young to type—let alone have her own account on Character.AI—but that hasn’t stopped her from nabbing his phone to have voice conversations with a Sherlock Holmes bot, which she uses to build her own mystery stories.\n\nCharacter.AI is an AI companion startup (though Anand likes to say it's an AI role-play startup, which we’ll get into later). He took over as the CEO in June in the midst of a potentially devastating lawsuit for its parent company and looming questions about child safety. When I ask if he’s concerned about his daughter connecting with an AI chatbot rather than a real human, he’s quick to say no.\n\n“It is very rarely, in any of these scenarios, a true replacement for any human,” Anand told me during a video call late last week. ”It's very clearly noted in the app that, hey, this is a role-play and an entertainment, so you will never start going deep into that conversation, assuming that it is your actual companion.”\n\nIt's a delicate moment for Character.AI.\n\nLast August, Google swooped in with a roughly $2.7 billion deal to license Character.AI’s technology. As part of the agreement, Character.AI’s two cofounders left for Google’s AI division.\n\nAnand, who previously worked as the VP of business products at Meta, was tasked with picking up the pieces—which he did in part by leaving behind the founding mission of delivering personalized superintelligence to focus on AI entertainment.\n\n“What we gave up was this aspiration that the founders had of building AGI models—we are no longer doing that. That is the hundreds of billions of dollars investment fight, which Big Tech is fighting,” Anand says. “What we got in return was clarity and focus, being able to singularly pursue the AI entertainment vision.”\n\nAs part of this change in strategy, Character.AI is no longer trying to build its own frontier models. “The last six months, we've done a lot of work to get off of our proprietary models on text and start using open source models,” Anand says. The company has tested a few: Meta’s Llama, Alibaba’s Qwen, and DeepSeek. “The open source models are beating any proprietary model hands down,” Anand claims.\n\nRunning an AI startup without billions of dollars in revenue can be a brutal equation, and Character.AI is still figuring out how to make the math work. The company told me it's generating revenue at a run rate of more than $30 million and is on track to reach $50 million in revenue by the end of the year. When I asked Anand how many users pay for the $10 monthly subscription, he didn’t give a number but noted “monetization wasn't a focus till four or five months ago.”\n\n“Since I've been on board, it's very clear we do need to monetize. And we've had, I think, almost 250 percent subscriber growth in the last six months. So the paid user base is growing quite, quite well,” Anand says. Character.AI recently introduced advertisements, including reward ads (where users can choose to watch an ad to get access to on-platform incentives), to help monetize in countries where subscriptions aren’t feasible, he tells me.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"selling\", \"revenue\", \"work\", \"anand\", \"agi\", \"focus\", \"ai\", \"company\", \"models\", \"gave\", \"months\", \"characterai\", \"startup\"]", "content_hash": "18bca29dd59da5867d900ac6d23164515e6453d7299bd709dd9af7b7100d56a7", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:34.558713+00:00"}

{"url": "https://www.wired.com/story/aol-shutting-down-dial-up-internet-access-in-september/", "title": "AOL Will Shut Down Dial-Up Internet Access in September", "authors": "[\"Benj Edwards\", \"Ars Technica\", \"Wired Staff\", \"Joel Khalili\", \"Tess Owen\", \"Kylie Robison\", \"Simon Hill\", \"David Gilbert\", \"Tomas Apodaca\", \"Kat Merck\"]", "published": "2025-08-12T22:55:47.963000+00:00", "text": "After decades of connecting US subscribers to its online service and the internet through telephone lines, AOL recently announced it is finally shutting down its dial-up modem service on September 30, 2025. The announcement marks the end of a technology that served as the primary gateway to the web for millions of users throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAOL confirmed the shutdown date in a help message to customers: \"AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. This service will no longer be available in AOL plans.\"\n\nAlong with the dial-up service, AOL announced it will retire its AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser on the same date. The dialer software managed the connection process between computers and AOL's network, while Shield was a web browser optimized for slower connections and older operating systems.\n\nAOL's dial-up service launched as \"America Online\" in 1991 as a closed commercial online service, with dial-up roots extending back to Quantum Link for Commodore computers in 1985. However, AOL didn't provide actual internet access yet: The ability to browse the web, access newsgroups, or use services like gopher launched in 1994. Before then, AOL users could only access content hosted on AOL's own servers.\n\nWhen AOL finally opened its gates to the internet in 1994, websites were measured in kilobytes, images were small and compressed, and video was essentially impossible. The AOL service grew alongside the web itself, peaking at over 25 million subscribers in the early 2000s before broadband adoption accelerated its decline.\n\nAccording to 2022 US Census data, approximately 175,000 American households still connect to the internet through dial-up services. These users typically live in rural areas where broadband infrastructure doesn't exist or remains prohibitively expensive to install.\n\nFor these users, the alternatives are limited. Satellite internet now serves between 2 million and 3 million US subscribers split between various services, offering speeds far exceeding dial-up but often with data caps and higher latency. Traditional broadband through DSL, cable, or fiber-optic connections serves the vast majority of US internet users but requires infrastructure investments that don't always make economic sense in sparsely populated areas.\n\nThe persistence of dial-up highlights the ongoing digital divide in the United States. While urban users enjoy gigabit fiber connections, some rural residents still rely on the same technology that powered the internet of 1995. Even basic tasks like loading a modern webpage—designed with the assumption of broadband speeds—can take minutes over a dial-up connection, or sometimes it doesn't work at all.\n\nThe gap between dial-up and modern internet connections is staggering. A typical dial-up connection delivered 0.056 megabits per second, while today's average fiber connection provides 500 Mbps—nearly 9,000 times faster. To put this in perspective, downloading a single high-resolution photo that loads instantly on broadband would take several minutes on dial-up. A movie that streams in real time on Netflix would require days of downloading. But for millions of Americans who lived through the dial-up era, these statistics tell only part of the story.\n\nThe Sound of the Early Internet\n\nFor those who came online before broadband, dial-up meant a specific ritual: clicking the dial button, hearing your modem dial a local access number, then listening to the distinctive handshake sequence—a cacophony of static, beeps, and hissing that indicated your computer was negotiating a connection with AOL's servers. Once connected, users paid by the hour or through monthly plans that offered limited hours of access.\n\nThe technology worked by converting digital data into audio signals that traveled over standard telephone lines, originally designed in the 19th century for voice calls. This meant users couldn't receive phone calls while online, leading to countless family disputes over internet time. The fastest consumer modems topped out at 56 kilobits per second under ideal conditions.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"online\", \"connection\", \"web\", \"broadband\", \"services\", \"service\", \"aol\", \"dialup\", \"access\", \"internet\", \"users\", \"shut\"]", "content_hash": "38bdb345321b5cddb5e6cf7c4696b4254d2272829ae6b9f7ba8fffa001d1ecac", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:35.943058+00:00"}

You’re in good company, as many of the WIRED Reviews team are also side sleepers. So are most Americans. The numbers vary across studies and depend on how rigidly you define “side sleeper,” but between half and three-quarters of people sleep on their side for at least part of the night.\n\nIf you're a side sleeper, you know how crucial it is that your bed keeps your back aligned while the hips and shoulders get some cushioning. Otherwise, it's a disaster. Without enough lumbar support, your middle is sinking in way farther than the rest of your body. Meanwhile, the hips and shoulders get that much more strain placed on them, especially if the bed is not forthcoming with pressure relief. It doesn't paint a cozy picture, which is why we side sleepers want something that accomplishes the lumbar support, pressure relief, and comfortability trifecta.\n\nMany of our testers side-sleep and can speak to the necessity of these mattress performance factors firsthand, including Reviews team director Martin Cizmar and sleep writer Julia Forbes, a certified sleep science coach. It's never so simple as just lying down on a bed and saying “Eureka!” That's why we spend at least a week with each bed to monitor our daily sleep and feelings toward each one. We as a team have collectively spent years testing hundreds of beds. Of those hundreds of options, we whittled it down to our 10 that we wholeheartedly can say are the best mattresses for side sleepers.\n\nBe sure to check out our other sleep guides, including Best Mattresses, Best Organic Mattresses, and the Best Body Pillows for Side Sleepers.\n\nUpdated August 2025: We added The WinkBed as our pick for the best mattress for heavy side sleepers and the Wolf Memory Foam Hybrid Premium Firm mattress as our best hybrid mattress pick.

Just one month after the premiere of the new live-action series Ironheart (see below) comes this new animated anthology series that delves even further into the Wakanda mythology. Two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Coogler—the man behind both Black Panther movies—developed this four-episode prequel in which the Hatut Zaraze, aka Wakanda’s “War Dogs,” embark on adventure-filled missions to retrieve long-lost Vibranium artifacts.\n\nIronheart\n\nRyan Coogler is responsible for what is arguably the best movie in the MCU (2018’s Black Panther), and now he’s executive producing one of its most interesting small-screen endeavors. Playwright Chinaka Hodge created this series, which picks up right after the events featured in 2022’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It stars Dominique Thorne, who reprises her role as Riri Williams, aka Ironheart, a brilliant MIT student who has successfully managed to create a Tony Stark–like suit of armor. It gives her the kind of invincibility that changes her outlook on the world—and leads her down a pothole-filled path that could see her heroic character go the way of the antihero in a way that critics have described as being similar to The Sopranos’ Tony Soprano and Breaking Bad’s Walter White.\n\nUnderdogs\n\nRyan Reynolds brings his penchant for turning genres on their heads to National Geographic with a brand-new kind of nature special. The Deadpool star narrates and serves as executive producer on this fun docuseries which puts the spotlight on the “underdogs” of the animal kingdom—those creatures and critters who don’t always warrant the same amount of respect as the kings and queens they share real estate with. Or, as Reynolds calls them, the “super zeroes.”\n\nDoctor Who\n\nSpring 2024 marked the beginning of a new era for Doctor Who fans when Ncuti Gatwa was officially handed the sonic screwdriver to take the legendary sci-fi series in new directions as the Fifteenth Doctor. He did it all over again with a second season, which aired a game-changing finale on May 31 that has viewers wondering where the Doctor will be headed next. Russell T. Davies is also back to oversee all the time-traveling shenanigans as the latest incarnation of the Time Lord journeys through space and time with companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), and new addition Belinda Chandra (Varada Sethu). While the series will keep its standing as a BBC staple in the UK and Ireland, American audiences will need to head to Disney+ to experience it all.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Underworld\n\nThere are two types of people in this world: those who think there are more Star Wars movies and TV shows that one person needs and those who are counting down the days until The Mandalorian & Grogu arrives in theaters next year. If you’re part of that latter group, you’re in good company—and have plenty of series to choose from, including this six-part anthology that follows 2022’s Tales of the Jedi and last year’s Tales of the Empire (see below). In true Star Wars style, it tells the story of two villains, former assassin/bounty hunter Asajj Ventress and outlaw Cad Bane, who form an unlikely alliance in an attempt to build new lives for themselves, until Bane catches up with an old colleague, who has switched sides to become a law-abiding marshal. Dark versus light battle it out once more.\n\nAndor\n\nAndor, which just scored 14 Emmy nominations, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, is something of a miracle. Created by Tony Gilroy, the two-time Oscar nominee behind Michael Clayton and a writer on the Bourne movies, it’s the origin story of one of Rogue One's most beloved characters, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). Set in the early years of the Rebellion, it charts Andor’s path to becoming one of the most integral of the Rebels. With a supporting cast that includes Fiona Shaw and Stellan Skarsgård, it features a fantastic score from Nicholas Britell (Moonlight, Succession). After spending so much time with Mandalorians and Jedis, it’s a welcome reprieve and perhaps the closest thing to prestige TV the Star Wars universe has released.\n\nOklahoma City Bombing: One Day in America\n\nThirty years after the Oklahoma City Bombing, Nat Geo takes a look back at the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The three-part docuseries features rarely seen archival footage and interviews with survivors who are sharing their harrowing stories for the first time. While it’s undoubtedly a tragic story, the series also recounts the inspiring way in which it united Americans.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nDaredevil fans were devastated when the original Netflix series was canceled in 2018, but Charlie Cox never strayed far from his title role for too long. He popped up as Matt Murdock/Daredevil in MCU movies (Spider-Man: No Way Home) and TV shows (She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Echo, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man), all the while biding his time until his eponymous series came back. Seven years and one massive overhaul later, fans seem to think it was worth the wait. Born Again sees Cox facing off against crime lord turned mayoral candidate Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) once more. There’s also a darkness to the series that seems to borrow a page from Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight playbook, though it’s not as elegant in its execution. Still, it’s a solid crime drama that sets itself apart from many other MCU series thanks to its more mature tone. Whether you were into the Netflix series or not, it might be time to dig in.\n\nWin or Lose\n\nWill Forte, Rhea Seehorn, Ian Chen, Melissa Villaseñor, and Izaac Wang are among the dozens of actors and comedians who lend their voices to Pixar’s very first original animated series. Over the course of eight episodes, this charming series plays out the same events that occur in the week leading up to a middle school softball team’s championship game from the perspective of various characters, including a wise bead of sweat known as Sweaty (and voiced by comedian Jo Firestone). If the title sounds familiar to you, it might be because the series created some controversy back in December when it was revealed that a transgender character’s storyline had been cut from the series. Disney’s reasoning? “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\n\nFour years after it was first announced, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man arrived early this year. The animated series dares to imagine what kind of chaos might have ensued if Peter Parker (Hudson Thames) had been mentored by baddie Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Colman Domingo) instead of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Oh, the horror (and fun)! A second season has already been confirmed, though likely won’t premiere until 2026.\n\nGoosebumps: The Vanishing\n\nFor more than 30 years, R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps books have fed the nightmares of young readers—much to their delight (well, usually). Now Disney is inspiring a whole new generation of horror lovers with this fun series, which follows the lives of a group of high schoolers who begin to unravel the terrifying truth about a decades-old murder—and the roles their nearest and dearest might have played in it—in their otherwise picture-perfect hometown. The always-affable Justin Long starred as a teacher who may or may not be possessed in season 1 of this anthology series. Its second, and final, season brought an extended title (Goosebumps: The Vanishing), a new cast (including Friends star David Schwimmer), and a whole new set of nightmares.\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\n\nDo you love Star Wars but wish it had more Warriors/The Wizard of Oz/The Brave Little Toaster energy? Lucasfilm has heard your cries and is here to oblige. For Skeleton Crew, they assembled a gang of four youths who get lost in the Star Wars universe and try to find their way home with the help of Jude Law, who plays an “enigmatic scoundrel\" named Jod. OK, so Star Wars probably already has enough of those, but who cares? The real treasure is the friends you'll make along the way.\n\nLuther\n\nAdd DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) to the long list of “conflicted cops who mean well.” It's a character archetype that TV viewers have seen dozens of times before, but few actors take it to the level that Elba does. Forget bending the rules—Luther dismantles them and has no regrets. Planting evidence? Killing a criminal? Buddying up to a homicidal sociopath who can take the real “bad guys” out on your behalf? Luther has seen and done it all in the name of justice. Somehow it’s hard not to root for him at every turn.\n\nLego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy\n\nSig Greebling (Stranger Things’ Gaten Matarazzo) discovers an ancient relic that alters the history of the universe—turning Jar Jar Binks into a lightsaber-wielding Sith and Luke Skywalker into Just Some Guy. With the help of a wise old Jedi, Sig must do what he can to piece things back together. Sure, the plotline has all the makings of a typical Star Wars story, but with Mark Hamill and Ahmed Best lending their voices to the minifig versions of the characters that made them famous, it also does so in a way that pokes just the right amount of fun at the canon.\n\nAgatha All Along\n\nAfter Kathryn Hahn became the (not-so-surprising) breakout star of 2021’s WandaVision miniseries (more on that below), MCU fans were thrilled—but, again, not surprised—when she nabbed her own series with Agatha All Along. The long-awaited spinoff takes place three years after the events of WandaVision, with witch Agatha (now stripped of all her magical powers) enlisting a teenager (Joe Locke) and a new coven to help her regain her status as HWIC. Aubrey Plaza, Patti LuPone, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp round out the stellar cast.\n\nBluey\n\nYes, Bluey is technically a children’s show. But everyone is welcome to enjoy this animated series from Australia, which centers around an endlessly curious blue heeler pup named Bluey and her family (mom, dad, and little sister). The show’s brevity—each episode clocks in at around eight minutes, and there are also mini episodes that are half that run time—is part of what makes it such a fun and easy watch. But the exploration of everyday feelings and emotions that everyone can relate to (humans, too) have made it a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Rose Byrne, Natalie Portman, and Eva Mendes are among the stars who have lent their voices to the show.\n\nArctic Ascent With Alex Honnold\n\nIn Free Solo (which is also streaming on Disney+), climber Alex Honnold dared to do the unthinkable, becoming the first person to free solo climb the 3,000-foot rock wall of Yosemite’s El Capitan. For most people, that dauntless endeavor would have been enough adventure for one lifetime. But Alex Honnold is not most people, as this three-part National Geographic docuseries makes clear. Here, he travels to Greenland with fellow climbers to conquer more unclimbed spaces in one of the most remote corners of the world. Vicarious anxiety never felt so exciting.\n\nStar Wars: Young Jedi Adventures\n\nIf helping to raise a new generation of Star Wars geeks was even a small part of your reason for having kids, this animated series, which is basically the Star Wars version of Muppet Babies, is a great place to start their education. Set during the High Republic era, approximately 200 years before the events of The Phantom Menace, it follows a group of young Jedis—Jedi Lites—who are sometimes stumbling their way through learning the ways of the Force. Like any good kid series, it also teaches important lessons about life and making a positive difference in the world.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nA Jedi turning to the Dark Side is a concept as old as the Star Wars franchise itself, and not something fans have given much thought to in terms of the “why.” But this Disney+ series dares to ask that question, and plays out a bit like a true crime procedural in a sci-fi landscape. Carrie-Anne Moss stars as a Jedi Master, and if her character seems a bit like Trinity from The Matrix series, that’s by design. Series creator Leslye Headland told Empire that the character owes much of its inspiration to the Wachowskis’ movies and that Moss’ Indara is basically “Trinity with a lightsaber.” In August, Disney announced that one season is all we’re going to get of The Acolyte, so savor all eight episodes.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Empire\n\nIt’s been more than five years since Disney released the last Star Wars movie, and The Mandalorian & Grogu won't arrive until May 22, 2026. Fortunately, Disney+ has plenty of TV series to fill the void, including this animated anthology that adds new stories about the franchise’s Galactic empire, in the same time period in which the original trilogy existed. It follows the very different journeys of two characters: Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto), a Force-sensitive human and member of the Nightsister coven who, after being one of the few of her people to survive the Clone Wars, is seeking revenge. Meanwhile, Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger) is a former Jedi who is questioning her own disillusionment with the order and what her road ahead looks like. Both are forced to make decisions that will change their individual destinies, and the galaxy far, far away with it.\n\nX-Men '97\n\nOf all the big-budget X-Men movies and TV shows that have existed over the years, it’s hard to believe that a cartoon series from the ’90s is one of the most beloved entries. But it’s true—and has a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score to prove it. When the revival arrived in 2024, many of the original voice actors returned to reclaim their characters, who must learn how to navigate a world without Professor Xavier to guide them. The events of this series pick up just one year after the point where the original show (which you can read more about below) ended.\n\nRenegade Nell\n\nLouisa Harland shines as Nell Jackson, the renegade of the title, who accidentally becomes one of the most feared highwaywomen in 18th-century England after she is framed for murder. Of course, this being a Disney series, it’s best to expect something a little magical—which in Nell’s case is Billy Blind, a magical sprite sent to help her realize her true destiny. What is surprising is that the series, which is perfectly suited to teens and their families, was created by Sally Wainwright, the brilliant mind behind such adult-themed series as Happy Valley and Gentleman Jack.\n\nDinosaurs\n\nNineties kids no doubt remember this sitcom about a family of dinosaurs. Earl Sinclair is a fortysomething megalosaurus living with his family in Pangaea circa 60,000,000 BC. While his days are spent working as a tree pusher (yep, he pushes over trees), he lives for his family: wife Fran and kids Robbie, Charlene, and Baby Sinclair, whose running gag of hitting his dad over the head with a frying pan and shouting “Gotta love me!” never gets old. Not even three decades on.\n\nEcho\n\nThis Marvel series continues the studio’s recent trend of shining a spotlight on its fearless—and complicated—female characters. In this case, that character is Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox), aka Echo, who is best known to audiences as a baddie from Hawkeye. But over the course of its relatively short five episodes, we learn why Maya—one of the MCU’s few deaf characters—must reconcile the events of her past and reconnect with her Native American roots in order to confront the future she has created for herself. Cox may be a relative newcomer to Hollywood, but she deftly manages to shoulder the weight of an entire MCU series.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians\n\nNearly 20 years after the release of the first book in Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series, this small-screen adaptation of that first title is being praised for how faithful it has remained to Riordan’s beloved words. Being a tween is hard enough, but for 12-year-old Perseus “Percy” Jackson (Walker Scobell) it gets even harder when he learns he's the son of Poseidon, god of the sea, and that he has pissed off his uncle, Zeus, who believes that Percy has stolen his thunderbolt. (And you thought having a zit was bad!) Fortunately for Percy there is Camp Half-Blood—a place where demigods like himself can learn to harness their powers and use them for good. It’s there that Percy learns the whole “with great power comes great responsibility” thing and embraces it—even if he'd rather be playing video games with his friends. A second season is set to arrive in December, with Season 3 already in the works.\n\nBehind the Attraction\n\nDisneyland, Walt Disney’s very first theme park, opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955. In the 70 years since, Disney parks have become a worldwide phenomenon and inspired rabid fan bases who make annual (if not more frequent) pilgrimages to these so-called Happiest Places on Earth. But what goes on behind the scenes? From the creation of major attractions like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean to its bustling food scene (Dole Whip, anyone?), this docuseries goes behind the scenes of the world’s most famous amusement parks.\n\nLoki\n\nThe MCU is exhaustingly huge. Yet while Loki is undoubtedly part of that universe, the series could just as easily work as a stand-alone piece, and it's all the more fun and surprising as a result. There are enough plot twists, silly one-liners, and time-travel antics to keep everyone entertained, and even a wisecracking alligator. If that doesn’t do it, Loki has a visual effects budget that would put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. Sure, it’s not the most intellectually stimulating show out there, but Tom Hiddleston does a great job of turning Loki into a fairly complex, interesting character. No word yet on whether there might be a third season in Loki’s future—and even Hiddleston is in the dark. “I truly don’t know,” he admitted to Variety in 2024, adding: “There have been other times when I thought that it was the end and I have been mistaken. But if this is the end, I'm so proud of where we ended up.”\n\nDaredevil\n\nBefore Disney+ became the home for all of Marvel’s TV content, Netflix was the place to find it—beginning with Daredevil, in which blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) spends his days seeking justice and his nights looking for revenge as a masked vigilante attempting to rid his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of its criminal element. While the series ended in 2018, Cox has reprised his role for a new series, Daredevil: Born Again, which arrived in early March (see above).\n\nAhsoka\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: Wait, another Star Wars series? And we don’t blame you for asking the question. But for old-school franchise fans, Ahsoka just might surprise you. Rosario Dawson reprises the title role as Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi who studied under Anakin Skywalker, which she first played in season 2 of The Mandalorian. Here, Ahsoka sets off on a journey to locate Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen, Mads’ brother)—a master manipulator who seems to be on a mission to become the grand ruler of the galaxy. A second season is scheduled to begin production in April, and will welcome Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker back into the Star Wars fold.\n\nThe Wonder Years\n\nIn 2021, writer-producer Saladin K. Patterson (Frasier, The Bernie Mac Show) rebooted the award-winning, and much beloved, series The Wonder Years for a new generation. Don Cheadle narrates the adventures of Dean Williams (Elisha “EJ” Williams), as he comes of age in Montgomery, Alabama, in the final years of the Civil Rights Movement. Both seasons of the worthwhile series are now streaming—as are all six seasons of the original series, which premiered in 1988.\n\nKizazi Moto: Generation Fire\n\nWhile Black Panther may have gotten an official sequel with 2022’s Wakanda Forever (which is, of course, available to stream on Disney+), this animated anthology series is in many ways a spiritual successor to that Oscar-winning MCU flick. More than a dozen up-and-coming African storytellers were handpicked to write and/or direct these 10 short films, which build on the makers’ cultures and histories to paint a fascinating, gorgeously animated—and often dystopian—picture of Afrofuturism.\n\nAmerican Born Chinese\n\nOscar winners—and Everything Everywhere All at Once costars—Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan reunite for this Disney+ original series. Jin Wang (Ben Wang) is your typical teenager who’s just trying to get through the day of dealing with high school social hierarchies. But his life is forever altered when he’s asked to serve as a mentor to Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), a foreign exchange student who is hiding some pretty big secrets. Like that he’s actually on an otherworldly mission from the heavenly realm and has chosen Jin to serve as his guide. Part coming-of-age tale and part mythological fantasy, the single-season series is a formidable adaptation of Gene Yang’s graphic novel.\n\nStar Wars: Visions\n\nFor a franchise as varied and diverse as Star Wars, sometimes its output can feel a little same-y. That’s not the case with Visions. The point of the anthology series is to provide “all-new, creative” takes on the Star Wars universe. The first series, which premiered in 2021, featured nine installments from some of the best anime studios in Japan, including Kamikaze Douga and Trigger. The second anthology, which arrived in 2023, broadens the scope further, incorporating work from studios in India, Ireland, Spain, Chile, France, South Africa, the US, and the UK. If you’re looking for the best one-off tales from the Star Wars universe, look no further.\n\nThe Mandalorian\n\nThe Mandalorian was, and is, exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed. Everything about this Jon Favreau series feels like classic TV—from the episodic adventures to the cameos. Set in the outer reaches of the galaxy, it follows a moody, masked Mandalorian bounty hunter (WIRED cover star Pedro Pascal) and really delivers on the hype with its retro-futuristic robots, salty Space Western vibes, lack of Skywalker baggage, and, of course, Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). The Mandalorian really set the tone for what a great Star Wars series could be, and while not every subsequent show has been as good, others, like Andor, have lived up to the precedent it set—and proved Star Wars stories can make for great TV. There's still no official word on a fourth season, but there is one more exciting adventure on the horizon: a movie, The Mandalorian & Grogu, which just got a May 22, 2026 release date.\n\nMs. Marvel\n\nWith Ms. Marvel, Disney manages to combine its knack for producing coming-of-age tween fare with its new role as caretaker of the MCU. Iman Vellani charms as Kamala Khan, an Avengers-obsessed high schooler from Jersey City who feels like an outsider in most areas of her life. But when a gold bangle arrives from her grandmother in Pakistan, Kamala begins to realize that all the time she's spent fantasizing about what life would be like with superpowers might have been preparing her for real life. With one foot in the teen drama world and the other in the comic book universe, Ms. Marvel—which just happens to feature Marvel’s first Muslim superhero—marks yet another admirable step forward for the company in both innovation and inclusion. In 2023, Vellani’s Ms. Marvel made the leap to the big screen to star alongside Brie Larson in The Marvels.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\nEwan McGregor has not always had the kindest words for the Star Wars prequels in which he first played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi—a role he inherited from Alec Guinness, who also had plenty of less-than-favorable things to say about the franchise. So it was somewhat surprising when Lucasfilm announced that McGregor would be donning his Jedi gear again to star in a stand-alone Star Wars series for Disney+. (Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has already said there will not be a second season.) In many ways, however, it allowed McGregor and former costar Hayden Christensen to course-correct some of their earlier work, as it follows a downtrodden Obi-Wan attempting to process his personal and professional disappointment over losing Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) to the Dark Side.\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back\n\nIn January 1969, just more than a year before they announced they were breaking up, the Beatles allowed a film crew unprecedented access to the creative process and recording of Let It Be, which would be their final studio album. Fifty years later, Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson was presented with the nearly 60 hours of film footage and more than 150 hours of audio that resulted from this project, and he remastered it and turned it into a three-part docuseries. Whether you’re already a Beatles fan or not, the documentary is a fascinating look at the creative process of one of the music world’s most influential bands as they work against the clock to finish recording an album, decide to have a free concert on their label’s rooftop, and occasionally butt heads. Knowing what the subjects do not know—that this will be the last time they perform live together or record an album—only adds to the project’s intimacy. The miniseries won all five Emmys it was nominated for in 2022, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nMoon Knight\n\nOscar Isaac brings yet another marquee name to Marvel’s growing roster of all-star talents with Moon Night. Here, Isaac plays a man with dissociative identity disorder, giving us not one but three distinct characters: mercenary Mark Spector, British gift shop employee Steven Grant, and the mysterious—and seemingly ominous—Jake Lockley. Ultimately, he must face off against himself to get the answers he’s seeking. For Moon Knight, Isaac told Empire that he was thrilled to be able to do something “really fucking nutty on a major stage”—and he delivers.\n\nThe Muppet Show\n\nWhile The Muppet Show, which ran for five seasons between 1976 and 1981, is considered a piece of classic television today, it wasn’t always smooth sailing for creator Jim Henson. Henson produced two one-off Muppet specials that were intended to take the show into prime time, but neither came to fruition. Fortunately, the Muppets did have a recurring gig in “The Land of Gorch” sketches that aired during Saturday Night Live’s first season, as viewers of Jason Reitman's Saturday Night learned. When SNL became a hit, Henson knew that there was a potentially massive audience for an adult-oriented Muppet show (not to mention celebrity connections to entice plenty of A-list names to host). The rest is Muppet history.\n\nThe Punisher\n\nThe Punisher is yet another Netflix-turned-Disney+ Marvel series that also happens to be a spinoff of Daredevil. Like Daredevil, the Punisher (real name: Frank Castle, played by Jon Bernthal) is a vigilante who seems to relish exacting revenge, regardless of the results. He and Daredevil operate within the same universe, and while the Punisher sort of admires Daredevil’s quest for true justice, Daredevil despises the Punisher’s by-any-means-necessary methods. Bernthal brings an intensity to the role that, while undoubtedly violent, also has a sense of humor about it.\n\nBoy Meets World\n\nIf ABC’s TGIF lineup wasn’t a part of your night as a kid, you clearly didn’t grow up in the ’90s. But Disney+ is happy to right that wrong by housing all seven seasons of the teen sitcom in its library. Corey Matthews (Ben Savage) deals with the ups and downs of growing up and ever-evolving relationships with friends and family—plus that one teacher, Mr. Feeny (William Daniels)—who always has the right answer to your problems, whether you like it or not. As the show progressed and the kids grew up, serious issues like drugs and sex were thrown into the mix, which didn’t always please the network. When the show aired on the original Disney Channel, a few episodes weren’t included in the lineup because of the more mature subject matter. You can also check out all three seasons of Girl Meets World, the series reboot (which features Corey as the parent and Mr. Feeny) when you’re done.\n\nJessica Jones\n\nJust about six months after Daredevil arrived on the scene, Netflix took another chance on a Marvel property with Jessica Jones. In this dark dive into the world of superheroes, Krysten Ritter plays a private investigator who gave up her days as a superhero after a major catastrophe. But you can’t deny who you are, as Jessica discovers when it seems like every case that comes her way forces her to confront her past—and the supervillain Kilgrave (David Tennant), who turned her into a shell of her former self.\n\nHawkeye\n\nYet another in an ever growing string of spinoff TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hawkeye gives some long overdue attention to Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton, who in many ways has often seemed like the forgotten Avenger. The supernaturally skilled archer is in most of the ensemble Avengers films, but this Disney+ series marks his first solo outing. The show sees Hawkeye teaming up with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), a precocious twentysomething who shares his skills for slinging arrows but lacks his eye for danger. It’s set during the holidays, and there are shades of Die Hard as the eponymous character tries to save the day and make it home in time for Christmas. Let the arguments about whether it’s a Christmas TV show begin.\n\nMonsters at Work\n\nMonsters at Work is the Monsters, Inc. spinoff you didn’t know you needed. It picks up the action six months after the end of the iconic Pixar movie—after Sully and his friend and colleague Mike (a giant green eyeball) have reworked the Monstropolis energy grid to run on laughter instead of children’s screams.\n\nThe Bad Batch\n\nYes, Disney really is milking its Star Wars properties for all they’re worth. The Bad Batch is an animated spinoff series set in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy in the overarching timeline. It follows a group of clone soldiers with genetic defects that give them individual traits and personalities, making them well suited to taking on daring mercenary missions. All three seasons are available to stream.\n\nWandaVision\n\nThis slow-burning sitcom parody is unexpectedly compelling. For the first couple of episodes, even hardened Marvel fans will have very little idea what’s going on, as Avengers Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live out an idyllic family life in black-and-white 1950s suburbia. Quickly, it becomes clear that something is wrong in the quiet town of Westview, as the world of the show ties into the wider MCU. Olsen reprises her role in Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which picks up right after the events of WandaVision.\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n\nAfter the surreal sitcom stylings of WandaVision, the second Marvel show to land on Disney+ covers more familiar ground. It's an action-packed thriller that follows Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) as they try to fill the void left by Captain America in the months after the events of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nStar Wars Rebels\n\nAccessible for kids and adults alike—and undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars TV series on Disney+—this animated series follows a group of rebels led by the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and featuring his force-sensitive Padawan, Ezra Bridger (Ezra Gray). Fan favorite Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) is another regular character across its four seasons, which do a neat job of fleshing out the time between the end of the prequel trilogy and the beginning of the original one.\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nHave you got some time on your hands? Well, the 36 seasons of The Simpsons currently streaming on Disney+ should keep you busy. What can be said about one of the longest-running—and arguably most famous—animated TV shows ever made? While the first season is a little patchy by today’s standards, and there are ongoing arguments about when the show went from essential viewing to neglected cash cow, whatever your view, there are literally weeks worth of entertainment here.\n\nX-Men: The Animated Series\n\nIf you really want to nerd out, this critically acclaimed animated X-Men series from the ’90s is worth a watch. In fact, the first two films in the live-action movie franchise drew heavily from this cartoon, which serves as a nice reminder of what can be done with rich source material.\n\nMarvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nThis seven-season series, which is for serious Marvel fans, revolves around S.H.I.E.L.D.’s less super agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). The first season takes a while to warm up, but it really hits its stride in its second and especially third seasons, and it eventually ramps up with a complex plot that ties into the films.\n\nAgent Carter\n\nAgent Carter is a better show than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it struggled to find an audience during its two seasons. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Peggy Carter from several MCU films in this 1940s-set series, where she doubles as an agent for the US government while helping Howard Stark (Tony’s dad) out of more than one jam. The two seasons stretch to only 18 episodes, so it’s a quick watch, but one worth making the time for.\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars\n\nThis is another Star Wars animated show worth seeking out, though it’s not to be confused with the equally worthy 2003 animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars from legendary Samurai Jack creator Genndy Tartakovsky. Both series deal with the period between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith and chronicle the rise of Anakin Skywalker from arrogant Padawan to powerful Jedi Master.\n\nInside Pixar\n\nThere’s a lot of behind-the-scenes content on Disney+. These are short clips that, in another age, would have been confined to the DVD extras menu. But this series of 20-minute documentaries on different Pixar movies offers a fascinating insight into the animated hit machine.\n\nWhat If …?\n\nHere’s an animated series based on one simple question: What if? The Watcher, played by Jeffrey Wright, is an extraterrestrial being who observes the multiverse, occasionally making minor changes to influence events. This series looks at how events in the Marvel movies would have turned out differently if they’d had a Sliding Doors moment. The first episode follows an alternate timeline in which Steve Rogers remains a scrawny sidekick and Agent Carter becomes a Union Jack-draped super soldier. Actors from the films reprise their roles, including Josh Brolin as Thanos, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Karen Gillan as Nebula.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"shows\", \"series\", \"55\", \"animated\", \"right\", \"star\", \"tv\", \"disney\", \"seasons\", \"wars\", \"marvel\", \"best\", \"season\"]", "content_hash": "29ff78d5c90083b06a86284a99886da30ddc18b2bcce60dd757f6e8196c2c61f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:37.525490+00:00"}

But the market for cycles with an electric assist has existed for considerably longer, and a number of companies predate the recent surge. One of them, Rad Power, has been around long enough that it was already an established presence when we first reviewed its hardware four years ago.\n\nThe company offers a mix of cargo, folding, and commuter bikes, all with electric assists. Having looked at a cargo version last time around, we decided to try out one of the commuter bikes this time. The Radster comes in road and trail versions (we tried the road). It's an incredibly solidly made bike with equally solid components, and it has very good implementations of a few things that other manufacturers haven't handled all that well. It also can switch among the three classes of e-bikes using a menu option; unfortunately, nothing else about the bike's performance seems to change with the switch.\n\nThe Radster is priced a bit higher than a lot of its budget competitors. So, if you're shopping, you'll have to think a bit about whether some of these features matter to you.\n\nA solid option\n\nOne thing that is very clear early: The Radster is a very solid bike with a robust frame. While the frame is step-through, it has some added bracing just above the cranks. These two bars, one on each side of the frame, link the down tube to the seat tube and extend to form part of the rear triangle. While this means you'll have to step a bit higher to get in a position to mount the bike, they contribute to the sense that this is a frame that will withstand years of daily use.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"frame\", \"youll\", \"road\", \"number\", \"commuter\", \"bit\", \"rad\", \"nonradical\", \"tube\", \"bike\", \"bikes\", \"radster\", \"powers\", \"solid\"]", "content_hash": "0c917dce2a95a9236ceb5393ef168420e753c1489d425c6f03b399784f76ffab", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:39.935715+00:00"}

There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket's nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.\n\nThe Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There's an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket's Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit.

For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.\n\nThese boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters fell off the launcher moments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"rockets\", \"secrecy\", \"space\", \"heights\", \"test\", \"vulcan\", \"launch\", \"rocket\", \"ahead\", \"boosters\", \"officials\", \"key\", \"ulas\", \"solid\", \"force\"]", "content_hash": "f6c60a699e18f2d2e375598e8a6800f4c5a6c348a69e7e00c7cbc0749fae9264", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:41.013251+00:00"}

But with AI models, this approach rarely works, and the urge to ask reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what these systems are and how they operate.\n\nA recent incident with Replit's AI coding assistant perfectly illustrates this problem. When the AI tool deleted a production database, user Jason Lemkin asked it about rollback capabilities. The AI model confidently claimed rollbacks were \"impossible in this case\" and that it had \"destroyed all database versions.\" This turned out to be completely wrong—the rollback feature worked fine when Lemkin tried it himself.\n\nAnd after xAI recently reversed a temporary suspension of the Grok chatbot, users asked it directly for explanations. It offered multiple conflicting reasons for its absence, some of which were controversial enough that NBC reporters wrote about Grok as if it were a person with a consistent point of view, titling an article, \"xAI's Grok offers political explanations for why it was pulled offline.\"\n\nWhy would an AI system provide such confidently incorrect information about its own capabilities or mistakes?

New discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope — a joint project by the European Space Agency(ESA), NASA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) — aren’t just surprising, they’re contradicting our deepest assumptions about how the universe works.\n\nFundamentally, it seems the universe may not be playing by the rules we mostly thought we understood.\n\nSo, what could it all mean for space exploration, space technology, and future deep tech? And what should space tech businesses, inventors, investors, and VC funds in Europe be considering as a result of the latest discoveries?\n\nAt Beyond Earth Ventures, we’re all about startups building rockets, AIs for satellites, space biotech, and fusion breakthroughs.\n\nBut as space fanatics, we also like to look deeper, beyond cap tables and pitch decks, into the places where theory breaks and mystery begins.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nEnter the $10bn Webb telescope, sent into orbit from Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, to look at the oldest light in the universe. Launched in 2021, the machine has been fully operational since July 2022.\n\nWebb isn’t just an upgrade from Hubble. It’s a time machine, an infrared sentinel, and — maybe most importantly — a destroyer of comfortable scientific assumptions.\n\nThanks to its findings, it’s becoming clear that we’re on the cusp of a major shift in theoretical physics and cosmology. Over the next few years, expect a wave of bold new theories, revisions to textbooks, and a renewed debate about everything from gravity to the origin of galaxies.\n\nBefore we consider the implications, let’s zoom out and consider the big discoveries from Webb that punch holes in what we thought we knew about the universe. Some of these are already triggering theoretical crises. Others might trigger entirely new fields of inquiry and invention.\n\nThe biggest revolutions start when theory no longer matches data. That’s what happened with quantum mechanics. With general relativity. With DNA. And maybe, with the Webb Telescope.\n\nHere are 10 of its discoveries challenging our theories about the universe:\n\n1. The universe is expanding faster than it should\n\nWe knew about the “Hubble Tension,” but Webb just confirmed it with more precision. According to the maths, the universe is expanding at 70–76 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc) — much faster than the 67 km/s/Mpc predicted by models based on the early universe (the cosmic microwave background). Translation? Something in our physics is wrong, or at least incomplete. A tweak to dark energy? A new force? A misunderstood early universe? The door is open.\n\n2. Galaxies grew up too fast\n\nWebb spotted fully-grown, massive galaxies just 500–700 million years after the Big Bang. These things are as large as the Milky Way, but their early appearance defies established science. According to the standard cosmological models, they simply shouldn’t exist yet. Theories say galaxies grow slowly. Reality says: they bulked up fast. Either we’re missing a trick — or the early universe was a lot more efficient than we thought.\n\n3. Dark matter may be wrong — MOND was right?\n\nThis one’s controversial: Webb’s findings align more with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) than the prevailing dark matter theory. MOND has long been the underdog of gravity theories. But if early galaxies are brighter and bigger than expected — just as MOND predicted — we may need to reconsider which invisible hand is shaping the cosmos.\n\n4. Black holes were way too ambitious\n\nHow do you get a 9-million-solar-mass black hole only 570 million years after the Big Bang? That’s what Webb found. This is astonishing because, according to current models, there simply wasn’t enough time or material in the early universe to grow such colossal black holes so quickly — suggesting either unknown physics or entirely new formation pathways. The black holes in some early galaxies are 1,000x more massive (relative to the galaxy) than those in today’s universe. Either black holes formed via some exotic mechanism — or they started as something much bigger than stars.\n\n5. Complex chemistry? This early?\n\nThe galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 is just 300 million years old, but it’s already rich in elements like nitrogen, which usually takes billions of years and several generations of stars to build up. How did those elements get there? Either the first stars formed and died much faster than we thought — or the Big Bang left us more “pre-built” than expected.\n\n6. Stars formed at warp speed\n\nWebb shows early galaxies as intense, explosive star factories — a surprise to scientists. Models expected slow, gradual star formation. Instead, it’s “giant balls of star formation.” Something — perhaps a lack of dust, or different physics — accelerated the timeline. And, again, the models can’t keep up.\n\n7. Planetary disks last longer than we thought\n\nPlanet-forming disks around stars were assumed to vanish quickly. But Webb sees them lasting 20–30 million years. That’s great news for exoplanet formation — and potentially for life. If planetary systems have more time to develop, life-friendly environments may be more common than we ever dared to hope.\n\n8. Galaxies were weirdly shaped\n\nHalf of early galaxies look like pool noodles or surfboards, not the small round blobs we expected. The standard model says structure comes later. But Webb’s showing us that galaxies got organised early — and in shapes we weren’t expecting. Something about angular momentum and matter dynamics in the early universe needs rethinking.\n\n9. Exoplanet atmosphere models are all wrong\n\nWebb’s ultra-precise spectroscopy revealed that our models of exoplanet atmospheres can’t reliably distinguish between different kinds. This shakes up everything from habitability estimates to the search for biosignatures. Basically, our “spectral fingerprints” are smudged — and it’s back to the drawing board.\n\n10. The cosmic web was already there\n\nWebb found a 3-million-light-year-long filament — part of the cosmic web — just 830 million years after the Big Bang. This structure was supposed to take billions of years to form. So either the early universe built things quickly, or we’ve fundamentally misunderstood the timeline.\n\nSo what does this mean for the tech ecosystem? For founders and VCs in deep tech, these findings aren’t just scientific trivia; they’re early signals.\n\nEurope’s ideas in focus\n\nIn our view, Europe is uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of innovation sparked by James Webb’s discoveries. The data streaming in is already catalysing new research efforts at leading centres like Germany’s Max Planck Institutes, the University of Cambridge in the UK, and ETH Zurich in Switzerland.\n\nIn the private sector, a new generation of European deep tech startups is rising to the challenge.\n\nSpace Forge (UK) is developing reusable satellites to enable in-space manufacturing of advanced materials — such as semiconductors — that could drastically reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, with major implications for the climate crisis.\n\nBioOrbit (UK) is advancing microgravity-enabled production of anti-cancer biologics, with the potential to shift some therapies from hospital IV drips to self-administered injections at home, radically improving patient access and comfort.\n\nAIrmo (Germany) is deploying a fleet of LIDAR-equipped satellites and drones to precisely monitor greenhouse gas emissions in real time — supporting industries in meeting increasingly stringent EU regulations to report GHG emissions.\n\nEuropean deep tech companies are increasingly supported by Horizon Europe, the EU’s flagship research and innovation programme (2021–2027) with a total budget of €95.5 billion. Horizon Europe backs high-risk, high-reward projects across climate, digital, and deep tech domains, serving as a critical bridge between frontier scientific discoveries — like those revealed by JWST — and breakthrough commercial applications.\n\nGaps in our understanding of the universe could open unexpected opportunities for European deep tech. Just as CERN put Europe at the forefront of high-energy physics, Webb could become a launchpad for the continent’s space tech industry.\n\nWebb’s discoveries could spark a new era of innovation by overturning everything we thought we knew about the universe. If the early universe is nothing like we expected, then what else might we be wrong about?\n\nCould the laws of physics themselves evolve? Are we missing hidden variables in space-time? Is dark matter an illusion, and if so, what’s really shaping galaxies? Could life have started earlier and more often than we imagine?\n\nEvery one of these questions could unlock a new wave of fundamental physics, new technologies, or even entirely new startup categories. From quantum gravity models to exotic materials to AI-designed cosmological simulations, there’s room here for founders to build at the edge of mystery.\n\nWhat next? Potentially a new generation of inventions, investors, and eye-opening discoveries. Europe is poised to take advantage.\n\nBy investing in deep tech, the continent can turn Webb’s revelations into commercial successes, shaping the future of science and society alike.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"european\", \"space\", \"early\", \"deep\", \"discoveries\", \"shape\", \"tech\", \"universe\", \"telescope\", \"models\", \"galaxies\", \"webb\", \"physics\", \"lessons\", \"james\"]", "content_hash": "75b4764a4c77944ab90a08e4c1a374f1aa3a51bc8414b1640939c8784494e3ca", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:46.183848+00:00"}

It doesn’t look like your typical lunch fare, but this unassuming dust could play a crucial role in the future of food.\n\nBekers is the co-founder of MicroHarvest, a Hamburg and Lisbon-based startup that turns agricultural waste streams into protein powder using microbes — tiny organisms that exist all around us. The vegan ingredient is already making its way into dog treats. If all goes to plan, human snacks like protein bars, shakes, and ice cream won’t be far behind.\n\nI visited the company’s Lisbon pilot plant on a sweltering summer afternoon last month. It’s tucked inside the Unicorn Factory, a sprawling industrial space on the city’s eastern edge that used to churn out pasta and cookies for the Portuguese military. Now, instead of carbs for soldiers, it’s housing bubbling vats of bacteria.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Unicorn Factory houses some of Portugal’s most promising startups. Credit: Unicorn Factory\n\nAt the centre of the lab sits a large steel fermenter with a small porthole, through which you can see a thick brown soup gurgling away. Inside, billions of microbes are feasting on leftover sugars from the agri-industry, multiplying like microscopic gremlins. Once they’ve done their job, they’re killed and dried into protein-rich powder.\n\n“We prefer to say they’re ‘inactivated’,” Bekers, who is originally from the Netherlands, tells TNW with a chuckle. “It sounds nicer.”\n\nThe final product looks like light brown flour and smells faintly like Marmite. It packs a serious nutritional punch — around 60% raw protein, plus a mix of fibre, amino acids, and other nutrients.\n\nMicroHarvest’s powder joins a crowded buffet of alt-protein options — think lab-grown chicken, algae nuggets, pea patties, and mycoprotein steaks. But Bekers is convinced that microbes earn their spot on the plate.\n\n“What we’re producing is much more efficient than plant or animal-based proteins,” she says. “You don’t need acres of land or gallons of water. Our microbes grow in days, not months or years, and they convert feed into protein with incredible efficiency.”\n\nA portal into the future of ferming? Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest’s fermentation process takes less than 24 hours — lightning fast compared to growing soy or raising cows. It is estimated to slash land use by 99% and cuts CO2 emissions by over 70% compared to beef.\n\nA 2022 study in Nature found that replacing just 20% of global beef consumption with microbial proteins could cut annual deforestation in half by 2050. Plus, bioreactors like MicroHarvest’s could be deployed pretty much anywhere there’s a significant agricultural industry.\n\nOf course, the idea of eating dried bacteria might raise a few eyebrows — or stomachs. But Bekers is quick to draw comparisons to foods we already know and love.\n\n“These are similar to the microbes you find in things like yoghurt, kimchi, or sauerkraut,” she says. “Food is a cultural phenomenon, and we get that. We’re not trying to replace your steak or convert everyone to veganism. We’re just adding another protein to the menu.”\n\nFermenting the future\n\nMicroHarvest’s protein powder can be added into all sorts of foods. It also makes for an effective thickening agent. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest is one of Europe’s best-known microbial protein producers, but the scene is bubbling with competition. Startups across the continent and beyond are experimenting with different microbes and feedstocks — from Germany’s Formo making alt dairy to the UK’s Enough turning fungi into meat.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate giants like Nestlé and Unilever are testing the waters through partnerships and pilot launches.\n\nGlobally, almost $1bn (€874mn) flowed into fermentation-based alt-protein startups last year, according to Dealroom data. Europe attracted nearly half of that, with 2024 marking the sector’s highest funding year ever on the continent.\n\nAlongside that, the EU unveiled a new €350mn funding strategy in July to accelerate the scale-up of fermentation tech, as the continent seeks to tackle its deep-rooted addiction to meat.\n\nEven replacing a portion of our protein consumption with a fermented alternative is a compelling proposition. It could significantly reduce the land and water needed for farming while slashing carbon emissions. But the transition is not without its challenges.\n\nFrom pets to people\n\nSwapping steak for microbes isn’t as easy as simply building more bioreactors. Fermented proteins currently face high production costs and a battle to win over sceptical consumers, whose opinions on food choices often become embroiled in culture wars.\n\nThen there’s the regulatory red tape. It’s unclear when — or even if — MicroHarvest will get the green light for human consumption. The lengthy approval process for alt-protein products has bogged down other startups in the space. One example is Dutch cultivated meat brand Meatable, which has spent years navigating the regulatory hurdles. Founded in 2018, the company is still awaiting approval to sell its products commercially. It’s now focusing on Singapore, where lawmakers have been more welcoming to alt-proteins than their counterparts in Europe.\n\nMicroHarvest nonetheless remains optimistic. The startup has already submitted a full dossier to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) seeking regulatory approval for human consumption of its fermented protein.\n\n“We’re really confident we’ll get it,” says Bekers. “We screened the full DNA of the strain, checked for any harmful potential, and submitted a very complete dossier.”\n\nMicroHarvest’s founders (left to right) Jonathan Roberz, Luisa Cruz, and Katelijne Bekers. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nFor now, MicroHarvest plans to scale through another customer segment: pets. Last year, MicroHarvest teamed up with Munich-based startup VegDog to launch its first commercial product — a vegan dog treat made with microbial protein.\n\nAnimal nutrition has fewer regulatory barriers than products for human consumption. The availability of conventional pet food and fish feed also falls short of current demand.\n\n“The pet and aquaculture industries are growing rapidly, but the supply of feed is not,” says Bekers, adding that pet food and fish feed already offer a strong path to profitability, even without the human market.\n\nMicroHarvest is now seeking Series B funding to open a new plant in 2027, with a planned capacity of 15,000 tonnes of product per year — 40 times its current output.\n\nBekers is tight-lipped on the location, but her fellow co-founder, Luísa Cruz, was eager to point out the benefits of doing business in her native Portugal.\n\n“If you want to operate a biotechnology company, Portugal is a great place to do it,” says Cruz, who earned her PhD in biotechnology at TU Delft in the Netherlands.\n\n“It has great universities for biotechnology and a lot of talent, which is why we decided to open our first plant here.”\n\nBacked by record private investment and fresh EU funding, fermentation-based proteins like MicroHarvest’s are bubbling with promise. But turning dead bacteria from pet snacks into mainstream meals won’t be easy.\n\nThe next few years will reveal if these microbial powders are a fleeting fad or the future of food. I’m sure cows will be silently betting on the latter outcome.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"microbes\", \"snacks\", \"regulatory\", \"proteins\", \"treats\", \"turning\", \"bacteria\", \"protein\", \"microbial\", \"bekers\", \"consumption\", \"dog\", \"startups\", \"food\", \"lab\", \"human\", \"dead\", \"lisbon\"]", "content_hash": "76fc56c6a0eda5daa039b0d88e8723b439cdd221f1c1df05ad8a73bc9b36c2d4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:46.775073+00:00"}

Regulatory bodies need to keep up by rolling out tighter regulations aimed at strengthening consumer protections and stabilising the market.\n\nAs EU lawmakers scramble to protect consumers, others worry they are smothering growth. Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty. The regulatory bodies are defending the public, but had restrictions been lighter, would HSBC have had more creative solutions for its customers, such as embedding personalised, data-first lending?\n\nBanks have been fearful of exploring innovative embedded lending solutions, as they were 15% more likely to receive formal enforcement action. However, in August 2024, HSBC decided the benefits were worth the compliance battle.\n\nWhile some argue that regulation can hinder innovation — with companies hesitant to invest in operations due to increased oversight — others state that additional regulation will increase innovation and, with that, see regulation as a key driver of their growth. So, who’s right?\n\nBreaking down the recent EU fintech regulations\n\nRecently, a few new regulations came into effect in the EU that have majorly impacted fintechs.\n\nDORA, implemented in January 2025, requires EU-established financial institutions (FIs) to implement processes and structures to help them respond to and recover from ICT-related disruption, providing them with extra digital resilience. Additionally, the AMLA is being introduced to give governments more assurance in combatting money laundering.\n\nDORA and the AMLA will apply to all FIs and their products and processes, but leave crypto outside their scope. That’s where MiCA comes in. Rolled out in December 2024, MiCA was drafted to protect individual crypto users.\n\nThe EU’s regulatory agenda — especially with the introduction of MiCA, DORA, and AMLA — is about tightening oversight. However, it is also part of a broader strategy to simplify and harmonise regulations, providing stability to the EU financial markets as a whole. The latest rulings strike a delicate balance between reassuring consumers and regulators, and easing the burden on regulated FIs.\n\nA new set of regulations may seem contradictory to the so-called Competitiveness Compass — published in January by the European Commission — which includes initiatives on simplifying and effectively implementing EU law. Nevertheless, these laws aim to replace fragmented national rules with unified EU-wide frameworks, making compliance clearer, faster, and more predictable.\n\nAs the digital finance ecosystem continues to accelerate, MiCA, DORA, and AMLA form a comprehensive framework. Collectively, they aim to balance innovation with financial stability, consumer protection, and security throughout the fintech sector.\n\nWill these updates support or slow innovation in fintech and banking?\n\nThis answer depends on the perspective. Recent EU regulations may slow innovation in the short term, particularly for the larger and well-established FIs like banks, but the future outlook looks more fruitful. These new rules are designed to support long-term stability.\n\nAs these three regulations require full harmonisation across the member states, they’re designed to reduce fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. A bigger and more uniform market will encourage cross-border activities, innovation, and competitiveness between fintechs and related service providers. The regulations also support the creation of better, more transparent products and services, helping to increase consumer and regulator trust, ultimately boosting customer adoption.\n\nIn short, this environment will offer greater opportunities for smaller and more agile fintechs to scale and compete long-term. For consumers and businesses, acting on the latest regulations results in more reliable and resilient services, which are much needed for essential functions like digital payments and lending.\n\nThese new regulations level the playing field, encouraging traditional banks and fintechs to compete on innovation and service quality rather than only on regulatory strengths. Moreover, a stable and secure financial system boosts the EU’s attractiveness as a hub for digital financial services, which will help make the union more attractive to new investors and innovations than the US.\n\nWhat investments will be required to meet these new standards?\n\nAdditional investment in governance and compliance structures is needed. Bigger, more well-established players may struggle to implement the required regulatory changes in their extensive processes and products. Those with existing compliance and governance processes will likely find the transition more seamless, while smaller fintechs may need to build these from scratch. The costs of their implementation present a potential hurdle.\n\nNavigating compliance is often a significant challenge for fintech startups and other smaller players. They’ll need to invest in knowledge, including how to correctly implement regulatory requirements into their processes and product designs, and translate these into operational business processes.\n\nOn top of this, investments in technology will need to be made as businesses must meet customer-facing requirements around transparency and language. For example, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will demand changes in know your customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring tools.\n\nHowever, compliance with the DORA regulatory framework is what will entail the biggest investment in technology, since digital operational resilience requires more robust security, backup, and testing methods. When working with partners who are fluent in compliance, the long-term payoff is clear.\n\nThe new finance model: Legacy institutions meet agile innovators\n\nNew technology has changed the way people interact with financial services, driving the growth of fintechs and increasing rivalry with established banks. One report found that 36% of 18-24-year-olds would choose fintech platforms over conventional financial institutions. Built on modern tech stacks and lean teams, fintechs’ agility allows them to react fast to changing consumer needs and market trends — a sharp contrast to the legacy infrastructure slowing down traditional banks.\n\nHowever, for both the old and new factions to succeed in Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape, traditional institutions and digital-native disruptors will need to depend on alliances. Effective partnerships between fintechs, banks, and FIs under the new EU regulations will be based on a mutual effort to enhance compliance, embrace innovation, and strengthen operational resilience. These collaborations are key for navigating complex regulations while delivering secure, innovative financial services.\n\nFintechs, FIs, customers, and merchants can also all benefit from Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships. For example, in the case of embedded lending, banks that partner with technology providers can scale quickly into new revenue opportunities, reaching new and existing customers outside of the direct scope of the bank, and thus try to keep pace with fintech competitors, without building their own technology in-house.\n\nIn fact, 41% of FIs have already implemented embedded finance solutions, and close to 50% have expanded their BaaS capabilities. Merchant customers then gain convenient, safe access to regulated, secure, innovative financial products from a trusted bank.\n\nAnother way that banks and fintechs can increase innovation while ensuring compliance is by engaging in collaborative models, including participation in regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments can support testing of new financial products and services under the supervision of regulators, providing a balance between innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe EU’s new wave of financial regulations isn’t just about tightening control — It’s part of a bigger push to simplify and unify rules across Europe. By uniforming patchwork national laws with consistent, EU-wide standards, compliance is now simpler to follow and predict. This uniformity and predictability can help encourage innovation while keeping consumer protection and financial stability front and centre. As fintech and banks collaborate, the future of digital finance in Europe is on track to be more open, safe, reliable, and inclusive.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"opinion\", \"compliance\", \"regulatory\", \"financial\", \"better\", \"fintech\", \"regulations\", \"europe\", \"innovation\", \"way\", \"fintechs\", \"regulate\", \"eu\", \"future\", \"banks\", \"digital\"]", "content_hash": "82915dce672f569d8b8d15c2f708b1453be1e0bcd65964d3688094326009eb6c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:48.119403+00:00"}

You’ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected — and sometimes disrespectful — judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?\n\nA pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and I’ve spent a decade doing casting for “Shark Tank” and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.\n\nI hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest — won by Dutch startup Tap Electric — captured what can make a founder’s story stand out. Whether you’re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:\n\nNerves\n\nYes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn’t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something — before, during, and after.\n\nEntrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.\n\nResearch\n\nA successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges’ backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can “do the most” with the funding or resources provided.\n\nDon’t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business\n\nWhatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.\n\nStart by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.\n\nLastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.\n\nWhat do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?\n\nAudience\n\nConnect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.\n\nInvite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links — all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.\n\nInternalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you’re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection – eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel — makes your message resonate.\n\nAsk\n\nYou would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.\n\nDon’t leave the most important part as a surprise — always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.\n\nIf the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.\n\nAs is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.\n\nContent\n\nA good pitch isn’t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.\n\nTreat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!\n\nRecord your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence “elevator pitch” and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.\n\nWrite a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience — what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained. Keep your community updated: this visibility can attract customers, partners, and even future investors. Leverage social media and other channels to amplify your story.\n\nA winning pitch is built on preparation, clarity, and connection. Research your judges, tell a crisp story, engage your audience, get specific about the resources and go-to-market strategy, make a confident and relevant ask, and then turn that one presentation into many pieces of compelling content.\n\nThese elements work together to make your pitch memorable and effective. A pitch including them can supercharge a business and accelerate your path towards growth.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"business\", \"judges\", \"mean\", \"insider\", \"competition\", \"audience\", \"ask\", \"pitch\", \"shark\", \"resources\", \"moment\", \"tank\", \"market\", \"pro\", \"lessons\"]", "content_hash": "ebc86269733a28b7dc25f62e5dd93c38b4258c905a1b9c024e49aee3ae02510c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:48.723969+00:00"}

Access to goods, services, and information not just for the few, but for everyone.\n\nVictoria Slivkoff, Head of Ecosystem at Walden Catalyst and Managing Director of Extreme Tech Challenge — a nonprofit uniting startups and VCs to accelerate progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — is excited for what lies ahead. In her view, the physical manifestation of AI could bring us closer to realising these ambitious goals.\n\n“Now we’re moving into the area of reasoning. AI is not just aggregating and organising information, it’s actually making predictions and drawing conclusions. How does that translate to the real world where robots can sense, learn, and interact with their surroundings?” she said to TNW founder Boris Veldhuijzen van Zaten in the latest episode of “Kia’s Next Big Drive.”\n\nWatch the full interview where Victoria and Boris discuss how we can leverage emerging technologies for positive global impact as they drive to TNW2025 in Kia’s 100% electric EV9 SUV.\n\nIn the not too distant future, we could be living in a world where robots are regularly navigating busy streets, offices, and classrooms. But as they become more common in our daily lives, is it them or us who will need to adapt most?\n\nRobots jumping the queue\n\nPicture this: you’re waiting for the elevator and a robot arrives at the same time. Who goes in first? If there’s only room for one, would you expect the robot to step aside, or would you treat it like a human and follow a “first come, first serve” approach?\n\nPast studies have found that most people expect service robots to be submissive, leading humans to prioritise themselves during conflicts, even in instances when a robot’s task was more urgent.\n\nWhat if a robot is carrying out a time specific task? The longer it waits until there are no humans in the queue, the longer it will take to complete it, whether it’s delivering a warm pizza or life saving medical supplies. So, how should robots navigate these social nuances without being ignored, undermined, or even bullied?\n\nThat’s what researchers aimed to find out last year in a study titled A Robot Jumping the Queue: Expectations About Politeness and Power During Conflicts in Everyday Human-Robot Encounters.\n\nThe researchers found that these robot-human interactions were more effective if participants expected an assertive robot which then asked politely for priority and entered first. But it’s not just robots that need to prepare to integrate into human society. The researchers highlighted that we may also need to rethink our attitudes and behaviours towards robots:\n\n“Should we maybe start thinking of service robots as having certain rights regarding priority if they fulfil human jobs with human responsibilities — or act as proxies for people? This might also help address the issue of robot bullying.”\n\nAs robots take on not only more responsibilities but also develop reason and sentience, at what point should we begin rethinking their social status?\n\nRobot teachers\n\nSocial robots — designed to communicate and interact with humans — are increasingly being used in caregiving, education, and mental health. In these settings, they help bridge service gaps, ease isolation, and offer emotional or learning support.\n\nUtrecht University of Applied Sciences is among those researching how robots can do more than just fill in; they can augment and enrich human-centred fields. For example:\n\nIn healthcare, how can robots be used to ease pre-procedure anxiety in children? Or help teach emotional skills for young patients who struggle with emotion regulation.\n\nAt last year’s Lowlands Science festival, the University showcased WOKEbot, a project exploring how a robot’s appearance and narrative voice (first vs. third person) influence human openness when discussing polarising topics.\n\n“Disagreements are timeless. People often manage to resolve them, but sometimes they simply can’t reach each other anymore. We saw this happen on a large scale not so long ago during the coronavirus pandemic. Are you for or against vaccination? When people dig in their heels and polarisation threatens, it can be helpful to have a neutral moderator,” said Dr. Mirjam de Haas. “The advantage of robots is that they are more neutral than humans. While you might be reserved with a person, a robot can make you more open and receptive to a different perspective.”\n\nAs part of her PhD research, Dr. Haas also conducted a number of successful experiments in using robotics to teach Dutch as a second language to students from linguistically diverse backgrounds. In her thesis defence, Dr. Haas explained that in the future, more and more students will fill classrooms. Having a robot aid will help facilitate learning for all students, including those with learning disabilities or those who are not yet fluent in Dutch.\n\nIs the world safe for robots?\n\nPerhaps the most recognisable robot in popular culture is The Terminator.

As sunshine bathes the leafy university campus, scientists inside the labs work under cool fluorescent light. Clad in green protective gear, they tend meticulously to test tubes within hermetically sealed cleanrooms. The containers hold the fruits of today’s labour: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).\n\nEach cell is barely a quarter the width of a human hair but wields remarkable power. MSCs reduce inflammation, repair damaged tissue, and modulate the immune system. They can treat chronic diseases and delay ageing. They may even prevent illness before it begins. But to become a mainstay of modern healthcare, MSCs must be produced at scale, affordably and reliably.\n\nThat seemed a distant prospect until recently, but the Karolinska scientists believe it’s approaching reality. They’re working for Cellcolabs, a Swedish startup formed to tackle the global scarcity of stem cell treatments.\n\nCellcolabs believes this shortage could soon be overcome. Thanks to a blend of scientific, regulatory, and technological advances, MSCs are edging towards the consumer market. Within the next decade, Cellcolabs aims to cut prices by up to 90%.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nIn the lab, the progress looks impressive. The latest harvest — cultivated from a single donation — has yielded 4.1 billion cells, enough for up to 200 standard doses.\n\nCellcolabs CEO Dr Mattias Bernow is in a buoyant mood. The 43-year-old sees today’s cultivation as just a taste of what’s to come.\n\n“I truly believe that we’re at an inflection point in the history of medicine,” he says.\n\nThe power of MSCs\n\nMSCs exist naturally in the body. A typical human contains billions of them. They act like a repair crew, fixing and tuning our insides. They can also be extracted, multiplied, and turned into medical treatments.\n\nKarolinska was the site of one of the field’s biggest milestones. In 2012, its Nobel Assembly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka. They discovered that mature cells can be made pluripotent — able to become almost any cell type in the body. The breakthrough rewrote the rules of regenerative medicine, igniting fresh regulatory momentum and fast-tracking stem cell therapies.\n\nMSCs are among the most promising examples. When injected, they release signals that trigger healing. The body then repairs itself.\n\nThey can treat countless conditions, from arthritis and heart disease to immune disorders. But first, you need to extract a small sample from a living, breathing human.\n\nCellcolabs sources its MSCs from the bone marrow of healthy donors aged 18 to 30. Just 50 millilitres — about a shot glass — produces up to 200 doses. The marrow naturally regenerates in six to eight weeks.\n\nThe donation process is quick and minimally invasive, but mass production is notoriously challenging. MSCs are living cells that require complex biomanufacturing, careful handling, and strict quality control, which makes scaling a formidable task.\n\nCellcolabs nonetheless sees industrial-scale production on the horizon — largely thanks to the pioneering research of Professor Katarina Le Blanc.\n\nLe Blanc’s landmark work showed MSCs could combat inflammatory and immune diseases. Her findings also proved that donated cells were suitable for therapeutic use — a crucial step for commercialisation.\n\nShe helped establish clinical-grade production standards, paving the way for large-scale trials and broader therapeutic use. Her research laid the foundations for Bernow’s inflection point.\n\n“This is not brain surgery or rocket science, but it is stem cells — so it’s quite close,” he says. “It’s super complex. And the only reason we can do this and move so fast is Professor Le Blanc’s research.”\n\nAs a haematologist, Le Blanc explored the potential of MSCs to support blood cancer patients. Her early clinical work focused on graft-versus-host disease — a severe and often fatal complication of bone marrow transplants. In a small trial, her team administered MSCs to patients who hadn’t responded to standard therapies. The impact was striking: more than half the participants survived. “The entire field just blew up,” says Bernow.\n\nLe Blanc continued pushing into new territory. One trial repaired vocal folds, restoring speech with minimal scarring. Another study used MSCs in COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation. The results were promising — but she hit a wall. “She ran out of cells,” Bernow says.\n\nScaling became a new focus. To expand treatment access, To expand treatment access, Le Blanc donated her research to Cellcolabs in 2021. Two years later, the Karolinska facility received production approval.\n\nProduction costs have fallen rapidly since then, fuelling hopes of a tenfold reduction. As prices drop and output scales, Bernow has his eyes on a target: “to truly democratise access to stem cells.”\n\nAfter spells as an ER physician, a consultant, and a startup founder, Mattias Bernow joined Cellcolabs in 2021. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nA new world of treatments\n\nBack in the lab, CPO Lina Sörvik leads a tour of the facilities. Previously a senior figure in big pharma, she joined Cellcolabs after being captivated by the potential of MSCs.\n\n“I was inspired by what they could do and by the idea of setting up a facility to produce them,” she says.\n\nOn a harvest day, her team’s work begins at 7:00 AM. Scientists don full protective gear and spend the day working inside the Karolinska cleanrooms. Once they’ve harvested the MSCs, the cells are tested for quality and frozen for future use.\n\nThe range of their applications is extensive. Middle-aged patients can gain relief from joint pain and injuries. Athletes can accelerate their recovery from injuries. The elderly could slow their ageing.\n\nBrian Johnson, a tech entrepreneur and celebrity longevity advocate, has also explored their powers. He had 300 million MSCs produced by Cellcolabs injected into his knees, shoulders, and hips.\n\nBernow lauds the variety of treatments. He says MSCs are interesting “for almost any indication.”\n\nHis path to them was winding. Raised in Malmö, southwestern Sweden, Bernow moved to the country’s capital to study at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE).\n\n“At that time, everybody wanted to become bankers in London,” he recalls. “That was not the future I saw for myself.”\n\nHe expanded his studies, earning a medical degree from Karolinska Institute and an MSc from SSE. After working as a clinical physician and management consultant, he co-founded Doctrin, a digital healthcare platform. Then Cellcolabs came calling: the leadership team needed a CEO and saw Bernow as a perfect fit.\n\n“I knew it was going to be more blood, sweat, and tears,” he says. “But the more I read, the more fascinated I became.”\n\nWhat fascinated him the most was the potential of MSCs to treat chronic conditions — the leading cause of death in the world. “That is why I think we’re truly at an inflection point in the history of medicine.”\n\nThe new antibiotics?\n\nBernow likes to share a quote from Joseph Martin, former Dean of Harvard Medical School: “Stem cell therapies have the potential to do for chronic diseases what antibiotics did for infectious diseases.”\n\nIt’s a bold comparison. Before Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, minor infections could be fatal. Healthy people died young or quickly aged.\n\nA century later, antibiotics let us live longer, better lives. Infectious diseases are no longer the leading causes of death. They’ve been supplanted by chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes. We’re also now living with more age-related illnesses, which severely reduce quality of life.\n\nMSCs, Bernow says, can help alleviate the growing burden of chronic illness. “But as a physician, what I find most interesting is the potential to prevent — or at least delay — the onset of disease.”\n\nHe recalls his time working in the ER, treating cardiac patients. A typical case was a middle-aged man who had just suffered his first cardiac event, now resigned to a lower quality and potentially shorter life. MSCs could have transformed that outcome.\n\nTheir regenerative and anti-inflammatory powers could support recovery — or even prevent the event altogether.\n\nTo reach this potential, Cellcolabs is targeting a new launchpad for scale: bioreactors.\n\nScaling for the future\n\nInside the Karolinska cleanrooms, Cellcolabs currently grows MSCs on flat surfaces in cell medium. Bioreactors offer a promising upgrade.\n\nBy vastly expanding cultivation surfaces and enabling automated, tightly controlled growth conditions, they could scale production far beyond what’s feasible with today’s methods.\n\nBioreactors could replace many of the manual methods currently used inside the cleanrooms. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nCellcolabs is developing its bioreactor platform with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Bernow expects it to transform production, multiplying MSC output many times over.\n\nFull-scale launch is slated for 2028. By then, Cellcolabs also hopes to have compelling new evidence for the benefits of MSCs.\n\nThe startup is currently involved in promising tests in the Bahamas and Abu Dhabi. Both locations have created progressive, patient-friendly, and ethically regulated frameworks for MSC trials, which have made them industry trailblazers.\n\nAcross their test sites, scientists are investigating treatments for a variety of conditions: musculoskeletal injuries, knee osteoarthritis, cardiovascular risk, arthritis, and age-related frailty.\n\nIn smaller territories such as these, it’s easier to update medical regulations for emerging therapies. If they’re successful, Bernow expects other nations to follow their lead and accelerate their support for MSCs. The potential benefits, he argues, are enormous.\n\nHe envisions the tiny cells shifting healthcare systems from reactive to preventative, cutting costs while tackling chronic conditions. Our lives wouldn’t just grow longer — they’d be healthier and happier.\n\nBernow draws a contrast with recent advances in Western medicine. We live longer, but our later years are often marred by frailty, illness, and a confined existence.\n\n“We’ve added years with lower life quality,” he says. “If stem cells can delay chronic disease onset, we can start prolonging our healthy lifespan.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean, he adds, that MSCs will create a fountain of youth. They won’t expand our lives forever, but they dramatically improve the time we have.\n\n“I want to spend the first 100 years being highly active and with my family — with my children, my grandchildren, and maybe even my great great grandchildren.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"medicine\", \"proclaims\", \"cellcolabs\", \"potential\", \"karolinska\", \"stem\", \"nears\", \"inflection\", \"cells\", \"mscs\", \"cell\", \"bernow\", \"chronic\", \"conditions\", \"mass\", \"startup\", \"production\", \"point\"]", "content_hash": "dd2308db432021a3bafbae98355a42723558f3b60fb80576193317aa296684bc", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:49.913811+00:00"}

Or seismic activity sensors built for construction that go on to detect submarines underwater. These ideas represent the promise of dual-use technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes. For the first time, the European Commission is explicitly proposing to fund them through programmes such as Horizon Europe. But as we race to embrace dual-use technologies, we face a pivotal choice: continue the old model where military applications drive innovation that civilians later adopt, or turn this paradigm on its head?\n\nTechnological innovation has long followed a well-trodden path: the military drives development, with civilian applications emerging as an afterthought. Consider GPS, arguably one of the most successful dual-use technologies in history. Originally developed by the US Department of Defence in the 1970s, it was designed for military positioning and navigation. Civilian access was restricted by “Selective Availability” — a feature that intentionally degraded accuracy to preserve the military’s advantage.\n\nThe full potential of GPS remained unrealised for decades until the deactivation of Selective Availability in 2000, instantly making it 10 times more accurate for civilian users. It quickly became a technology that most of us rely on every day, sparking innovations that transformed industries from agriculture to transportation. A 2019 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that GPS had generated $1.4 trillion in economic benefits.\n\nThis military-first approach, as we’ve seen with GPS, has dominated innovation funding for decades. Yet there’s compelling evidence that civilian-first approaches to dual-use technologies both better serve society’s immediate needs and ultimately produce more robust solutions for all applications — including military ones.\n\nThe traditional model overlooks a critical reality: civilian markets provide both scale and diversity of applications that drive innovation in ways the more specialised military sector cannot match. This pattern repeats across technological domains. Internet protocols developed for military communications found their greatest evolution in civilian applications, before returning to enhance military systems. The commercial drone industry has accelerated aerial innovation far beyond what military procurement alone could achieve.\n\nBy focusing on civilian-first use cases, innovation can leverage larger markets, more diverse applications, and faster development cycles. When technologies are developed with broad civilian applications in mind, they benefit from economies of scale that military-only development cannot achieve.\n\nThis is in part because civilian innovation faces fewer bureaucratic constraints. Military procurement cycles can span years or even decades, while civilian markets reward agility and rapid iteration. Developing for civilian use first allows technologies to evolve and mature faster than would be possible under traditional defence procurement timelines.\n\nThe most promising dual-use breakthroughs come from tackling fundamental technical challenges rather than specific operational functions. When innovators focus narrowly on military operations, they often miss the broader potential of their technologies. Scientific potential isn’t abstract; it only becomes real through implementation.\n\nThe challenge of developing robust navigation systems that work without GPS is a perfect example. A solution that enables delivery drones to navigate urban environments reliably could revolutionise logistics while simultaneously providing capabilities critical for defence operations. By emphasising civilian applications while acknowledging potential military uses, we create space for innovations that might otherwise never emerge.\n\nResearch from the European Commission on introducing a military tech aspect to the successor to Horizon Europe found that academic and research institutions would prefer to stick to the status quo, and keep Europe’s R&D funding solely for civilian technologies. By providing funding pathways that respect these preferences, we expand the talent pool, addressing critical technological challenges. Given the financial strains and political pressures in US higher education, Europe could attract top innovators from across the Atlantic by creating an environment aligned with their core values.\n\nAs Europe intensifies its focus on strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty, dual-use technologies will play an increasingly important role. The EU’s recent moves to allow dual-use funding through programs such as Horizon Europe represent an important shift in how we approach innovation. But as these initiatives take shape, they must avoid simply replicating the traditional military-first model.\n\nBy prioritising civilian use cases while acknowledging military applications, we can leverage market forces, attract diverse talent, and produce more robust technologies for all applications.\n\nYet for dual-use development to be truly durable, civilian and military technologies must no longer be siloed – we have to bridge the gap between civilian first R&D and military use cases. Given the chasm that exists between the way these two sectors operate, this will need to be an active process. Initiating more open knowledge exchange would better apply insights and learnings from both worlds back and forth. For bodies that focus on military technology, it is time to incubate a civilian equivalent. Conversely, organisations like mine — SPRIND, the German federal agency for disruptive innovation — focused on civilian technology, should also explore military applications.\n\nThe challenges we face — from climate change and energy security to supply chain resilience — require technological solutions that serve multiple purposes. The old dichotomy between civilian and military innovation is increasingly outdated in a world where the most powerful technologies inevitably serve both domains.

But he’s begun to wonder if candidates’ answers are genuine, even on video calls. “I can see their eyes shifting across the screen,” he says. “Then they come back with the perfect answer to a question.” The trust gap between employer and jobseeker is widening, and it’s fast becoming one of the trickiest knots in modern hiring.\n\n\n\nFrom ChatGPT-polished CVs to full-blown applications submitted by bots, GenAI has hit the job market hard and gone fully mainstream. For a sizable generation of jobseekers — 68% of European tech workers were actively looking for a new role at the end of 2024 — it’s commonplace to use AI to tweak a CV or even complete an entire application.\n\n\n\nTools like Sonara, LazyApply, and JobCopilot have made it easy to shoot off dozens of applications in a day. In June, data from TestGorilla found that just over a third (37%) of UK jobseekers are using AI to complete applications. Among early-career candidates, it jumps to 60%, up from 38% the year before, according to Bright Network, which connects graduates and young professionals with recruiters.\n\nStartups are at the forefront of this AI arms race. With smaller teams, shorter runways, and a culture of speed, they’re particularly exposed to this strange new world of suspiciously shiny applicants and AI-assisted code challenges. Most aren’t fighting it: 85% of employers now actively accept AI-assisted applications. But their acceptance doesn’t equal apathy. Amid a deluge of blatant AI use, how are Europe’s most agile companies working out who’s being real — and if they’re worth bringing onboard?\n\nA new normal\n\nUsing AI to troubleshoot and tailor a CV has become par for the course. For most jobseekers, GenAI acts like a digital sidekick — smoothing grammar, sharpening phrasing, and cranking out tailored applications faster than ever. According to Canva’s January survey of 5,000 employees across countries including the UK, France, Spain, and Germany, 45% had used GenAI to build or improve a resume — and have yielded positive results. But hiring managers aren’t entirely sold. In the UK, 63% believe candidates should disclose if AI played a role in their application materials, signifying that trust is on shaky ground.\n\nOther research suggests that attitudes depend on the context. A global survey by Experis (part of workforce giant ManpowerGroup) found that 28% of tech leaders are fine with AI if used to personalise a resume or cover letter, 26% with help on problem-solving tests, and 24% even with answering interview questions. Just 15% said AI use is unacceptable across the entire job application process.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nFor Duco van Lanschot, co-founder of fintech startup Duna, it’s all about the role. “If an engineer used ChatGPT to polish a written application, fine. That’s not the job. But for a growth or sales hire to use it very obviously is a big red flag,” he says. “The job itself involves public-facing comms and emailing stakeholders — and in a sea of generic, AI-generated copy, I want us to be as human as possible.”\n\nTech employers and startups are adapting — albeit in different ways and at different speeds. Some are setting ground rules for usage, some are bulking out human-only processes, and some are cutting away entire parts of the “traditional” hiring approach. “AI hasn’t broken hiring,” says Marija Marcenko, Head of Global Talent Acquisition at SaaS platform Semrush. “But it’s changed how we engage with candidates.”\n\nGoodbye to CVs\n\nIn the words of Khyati Sundaram, ethical AI hiring expert and CEO of Applied, we’re in the middle of “an AI-on-AI war.” And in the fallout, traditional application materials are losing their sway. In the tech sector, cover letters fell into obsolescence long ago, and CVs are next on the chopping block. “A huge upside is that it’s exposing résumés for what they are — a broken artefact,” says Sundaram, whose team works with the likes of Unicef UK, BLab, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. “Putting résumés into keyword scanners or GenAI tools isn’t solving the problem for those hiring, because when it comes to the interview, the candidate falls apart,” she explains.\n\nInstead of cover letters and cut-and-paste CVs, employers are turning to structured questionnaires and skill-based tasks — tools that measure how someone thinks, not just how well they can write a prompt. “Skill-based hiring is no longer just a tech hiring thing,” Sundaram adds. “We’re seeing that crop up in more white-collar roles across the board.” According to TestGorilla, 77% of UK employers now use skills tests to evaluate candidates, with the same proportion saying these tests outperform CVs in predicting job success. This should have a positive effect in the long term: LinkedIn’s Economic Graph Institute found that a skills-based approach globally could expand talent pools by 6.1x, and help broaden gender and minority representation.\n\nAt Semrush, the shakeup is already in full swing. Hiring managers are trained to sniff out fluency without depth, spotting signs of AI in real-time coding challenges or task-based interviews. “We’ve replaced the usual ‘Tell me about yourself’ prompts with in-depth interviews that explore experience, soft skills, and thinking patterns,” says Marcenko. “It’s hard to fake those, with or without AI.”\n\n\n\nApplied’s own system uses a mix of automation and human insight. “We don’t believe in AI detectors — they’re rarely accurate, so we train reviewers to pattern match like an AI, comparing submissions to known GPT outputs,” explains Sundaram. “If five responses sound suspiciously identical, humans can flag them.”\n\nElsewhere, startups are getting more creative and more human. Alessandro Bonati, Chief People Officer at travel scaleup WeRoad, has ditched cover letters in favour of more creative, human-centric formats like curated portfolios or briefs of the “show, don’t tell” type. The company, which has over 210 staff in offices across Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, actively encourages candidates to use AI. “But that’s also accompanied by traditional in-person interviews to assess candidates’ thinking, communication, and cultural fit in real time,” says Bonati. His team also leans on real-time scenario-based exercises that reflect how candidates would collaborate, not just how well they can prepare.\n\nThe return of the reference and in-person interviews\n\nAnother ripple effect: references are back on the menu. Santiago Nestares, co-founder of the accounting startup DualEntry, is spending more time face-to-face on Zoom with candidates. “Experience is hard to fake,” says Nestares. “You can usually tell when someone’s just read about something versus having lived it.” He’s also going deeper on references; not just the usual ones, as those are always glowing, but backchannel conversations with people who’ve worked with them directly. “It’s so we can find out how someone handles pressure, works with a team, and shows up day to day,” says Nestares.\n\nThrough building the team for Connectd, a platform which enables angel investors and founders to effectively manage their startups, Samuel has noticed that candidates are cutting through the lack of trust by building more social proof around themselves. “For hiring managers, instead of taking a candidate’s word for it, we’re diving into references more than ever,” he says.\n\nThe dreaded take-home task is on the way out now too. Unpaid and time-consuming, candidates have long despised them, and now that there’s the option of using GenAI to fake it (until they make it), employers are souring on them too. Live interviews, technical walk-throughs, scenario-based challenges, and even roleplay simulations are becoming the new standard, particularly in product, design, and marketing roles. “AI detectors are being used,” says Andreas Bundi, founder of Berlin-based HR consultancy Bundls. “But most companies are asking — why bother with take-homes when you can just do a live assessment?”\n\n\n\nBundi, who works with clients like Pitch, Cradle and Telli, says hybrid companies with mandatory office days are ditching take-homes to keep the interview process aligned with on-site work. With more candidates on the market, jobseekers are going further — relocating, or even flying in for interviews.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, well-funded companies are increasingly comfortable bringing people on-site for tasks. “When travel isn’t possible, I’ve arranged in-person meetings with interviewers who happen to be nearby,” says Bundi. “I recently scheduled interviews around a conference both the candidate and interviewer were attending.” This “networking meets hiring approach” works surprisingly well.\n\nBundi says he sees that it’s the AI-first companies that are more relaxed about candidates using tools like ChatGPT — but it’s rarely made explicit. Recently, one of his Lead Data Scientists blew an interview by manually wrangling messy data instead of automating it. “They thought they needed to demonstrate their raw coding skills,” says Bundi. “But the company wanted strategy, not a human data janitor. That’s what ChatGPT is for.” As AI becomes standard, candidates and companies will need to get clearer on where it fits in the process. Until then, these frictions will continue.\n\nHire for skills and values, not a job description\n\nDespite the ubiquity of AI-powered applications, most companies still haven’t formalised their approach. “It’s confusing for candidates, as some companies don’t want AI used in applications, even though those same roles involve AI tools every day,” says Sundaram. Indeed, 40% of employers using BrightNetwork services said they still haven’t set guidelines for AI usage in their processes, although 28% plan to for the next recruitment season. Of those who have set guidelines, 44% don’t allow candidates to use AI.\n\n\n\n“The vanguard employers want everyone to use it and demonstrate their AI literacy,” says Sundaram. Some of Applied’s clients have even added the question: ‘How will you use AI in this job?’ She warns, however, that many of the quick fixes employers reach for — AI detectors, video screening with facial tracking, voice sentiment tools — raise huge ethical concerns. “If companies are tracking facial expressions for emotional nuance, it gets creepy,” she says. “Where do we draw the line?”\n\n\n\nInstead, she argues, the fix will lie in redefining what candidates are being tested for. Applied has shifted from traditional job architecture to task architecture, evaluating not just skills, but values like resilience, adaptability, and mission alignment. “These are the human traits that will matter even more as jobs evolve,” she says. “Especially in startups, where everyone’s a generalist.”\n\nWithout doubt, generative AI is fundamentally reshaping the hiring process. The most forward-looking startups aren’t resisting the change — they’re building better processes around it. CVs may be broken, cover letters outdated, and applications increasingly synthetic — but the real differentiator is still very human. “We need people who can adapt, not just apply,” says Sundaram. “Because the job they’re hired for today may not exist in six months.” Startups that understand this and structure their hiring accordingly aren’t just future-proofing their teams, they’re rewriting the rules of work for the AI era.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"aionai\", \"employers\", \"applications\", \"candidates\", \"recruitment\", \"sundaram\", \"rewriting\", \"ai\", \"companies\", \"playbook\", \"theyre\", \"job\", \"human\", \"hiring\", \"war\"]", "content_hash": "a4f6b086bdd4bcd929bb2ca4696119aa3ef3cfbb6a6037db5f55c2e5b18487ea", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:51.122735+00:00"}

Then there is Asia — with China’s rapid developments and Japan and South Korea’s deep legacy in robotics. Headlines still gravitate toward billion-dollar budgets, rapid hardware iterations, and slick simulation reels.\n\nBehind the noise, though, another development is unfolding in Europe — quieter, but potentially far more consequential. The next chapter of humanoid robotics may be defined not by who moves first or builds the flashiest prototypes, but by who moves with the discipline and consistency required. And Europe has the potential to lead this new era.\n\nRegulation as strategy\n\nIn most conversations about innovation, regulation is framed as a brake. In Silicon Valley, it’s often seen as a hurdle to scale or a signal of bureaucratic overreach. But Europe — particularly in AI and robotics — is rewriting that narrative. With the AI Act now adopted, the EU is the first region to offer comprehensive legal clarity around the deployment of high-risk AI systems, including humanoid robots.\n\nWe must also consider that, eventually, other countries will likely adopt regulatory frameworks that align broadly with the EU’s, even if they’re less stringent. By designing with European standards from the outset, we’ll be well-positioned to adapt quickly as new regulations emerge elsewhere.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nThis clarity matters. When investors and industrial partners can reliably assess compliance risks, they’re most likely to commit resources. In a field as complex and potentially disruptive as robotics, clear rules don’t slow down progress — they de-risk it.\n\nEurope has also introduced or updated several other regulations that directly impact robotics:\n\nThe Product Liability Directive now includes software and AI, reducing ambiguity and incentivising safer design practices.\n\nThe General Product Safety Regulation streamlines cross-border market entry with harmonised safety standards.\n\nThe Machinery Regulation defines clearer certification routes for robotic systems.\n\nTogether, these frameworks give the EU a coherent and predictable regulatory environment. Yes, it’s tough, but given the implications, this provides exactly what the humanoid sector needs: clarity.\n\nDeployment, not demos\n\nWhile the US often relies on innovation funded by Big Tech monopolies and China leans on state-driven manufacturing strategies, Europe’s robotics sector is built on modular collaboration. Startups and research labs spin out into well-funded clusters, often supported by EU-backed initiatives like RI4EU and EIC Accelerator. These programs offer access to testbeds, pilot funding, and collaborative R&D networks.\n\nFurthermore, Europe’s geographic and industrial structure gives it a special advantage: close proximity to real-world use cases. Having neighbouring logistics hubs, manufacturing zones, and retail chains in contiguity helps speed iteration and aligns development with the continent’s actual operational pain points. McKinsey estimates that in some of Europe’s critical sectors — including retail and logistics — payroll alone amounts to $1.7 trillion (€1.55 trillion). This makes automation highly profitable and ripe for disruption.\n\nThese factors have played a key role in the strategy of Humanoid, the robotics company I founded in the UK last year. Our goal isn’t just to impress on stage; it’s far more important that we seamlessly integrate innovations into real workflows. For this, we’ve adopted a simple, modular design philosophy: a wheeled base that suits logistics environments, accelerated by simulation plus feedback from real industry trials. We believe that hype must be based on reality — a mindset that’s drawing US investors to European robotics.\n\nThis shift is already reflected in funding dynamics. Neura Robotics’ €120mn funding round in January 2025 was one of the largest in European robotics to date. And investors are now betting on full-stack teams with credible deployment strategies — instead of merely speculative tech.\n\nHumanoid’s latest robot, HMND 01, was introduced in a video earlier this year. Credit: Humanoid\n\nA better fit for the future of work\n\nBeyond reducing uncertainty, European regulation also helps encode values that shape how humanoid robots are developed and deployed. The AI Act requires high-risk systems — including those used in workplaces, public spaces, and healthcare settings — to meet strict safety, transparency, and human oversight standards.\n\nSuch a framework fosters trust, which is essential for robots operating in sensitive environments like factories, hospitals, or elderly care facilities. Europe’s emphasis on traceability and ethical co-development goes beyond mitigating risk — it creates the conditions for adoption at scale, where safety and dignity are non-negotiable.\n\nAdditionally, this approach helps position robots as partners. By designing for augmentation rather than displacement — as often seen in the US — European startups are modelling a more human-centred approach to automation. They’re also offering an alternative to the dominant narrative that robots will replace humans in critical roles.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that some jobs aren’t meant for people, as they hinder individuals from reaching their full potential. For instance, a humanoid could take over the task of moving boxes around a warehouse all day. This is not simply a replacement; it is an augmentation of existing automation capabilities, which empowers people to find more purpose-driven work.\n\nThat distinction comes into sharper focus when we look at the places where humanoids are most needed, such as logistics hubs, clinics, and care homes. These environments have real spatial and regulatory constraints and little room for error. The tasks there are repetitive but require precision, and people are extremely busy. In these settings, robots need to quietly support the flow of work, not interrupt it. That requires thoughtful integration, which means responding at the right pace, handling objects predictably, and, yes, staying out of the way when needed.\n\nThese are practical challenges shaped by day-to-day routines, not only engineering feats. And, from our vantage point, Europe’s cautious, user-informed development model is well-suited to meet them.\n\nSupply chains and strategic independence\n\nThere are still concerns in European robotics that need to be addressed. As of 2025, China controls 63% of the humanoid hardware supply chain, from rare-earth magnets to key actuators. However, we’re now seeing global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) based in Europe partnering with humanoid creators early on to co-develop hardware components together. This strategy can mitigate the risk of over-dependence.\n\nOn the other hand, while the US dominates in AI software, few actors globally offer fully-integrated stacks. We see some moves in that direction in the US and China, and Europe — which is still dependent on imports — must learn to navigate this space assertively.\n\nCalls for supply diversification are growing. In June 2025, Benjamin Krieger, from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA), emphasised the need for stronger EU supply chain routes due to China’s export controls on rare-earth elements. In the US, analysts are sounding similar alarms.\n\nTo reduce dependency, Europe will need to support local manufacturing of key components, incentivise alternative sourcing, and form trade alliances outside Beijing’s orbit.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe next phase of humanoid robotics will not be won by whoever moves fastest. It will be won by whoever builds best.\n\nWhat will this require? To start, bolstering funding and support mechanisms that help innovations advance through the later stages of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale — and move from pilots to industrial-grade rollouts. Second, forging industrial partnerships that begin during prototyping, not after. Third, policy agility to fast-track certification while maintaining the highest safety standards.\n\nWhat’s at stake isn’t just who secures the most patents — we’ve already seen that happen without meaningful real-world deployment. The true challenge is whether we can build systems that integrate safely into human environments, uphold public trust, and address the real concerns people have — from privacy and transparency to everyday safety and interaction.\n\nEurope doesn’t need to mimic Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Instead, it needs to double down on what it already does well: interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical tech design, and industrial pragmatism.\n\nThe global humanoid race is not a sprint — it’s a long-term infrastructure project. And if we get it right, Europe could build the future’s most trusted workforce —- one that collaborates with humans and changes the world, one robot at a time.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"european\", \"safety\", \"humanoid\", \"ai\", \"race\", \"europe\", \"robotics\", \"eu\", \"robots\", \"win\", \"europes\", \"need\", \"quietly\"]", "content_hash": "8029ef43a1e99617e17b64c4dd64eba16fadbfd6d11ad701563f5949b3ab9754", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:51.707525+00:00"}
{"url": "https://thenextweb.com/news/eu-ai-act-job-displacement", "title": "Can the EU's Act protect jobs without stifling innovation?", "authors": "[\"Ray Fernandez\", \"Story By\"]", "published": "2025-08-01T06:00:02+00:00", "text": "While the US has largely pursued AI development with minimal regulatory oversight, Europe has taken a markedly different approach. The Data Protection Act, the GDPR, and the recent AI Act — aligned more closely with local workers’ laws and unions — have set the continent on a separate path.\n\nA recent joint study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Poland’s National Research Institute (NASK) found that Europe — along with Asia — tops the list of most exposed regions to AI, far surpassing the Americas. With studies finding that one in four jobs are at risk of being transformed by AI globally, the impact in Europe — a region which faces a significant shortage of skilled workers — has become a pressing concern.\n\n“In many ways, it’s too early to tell where the AI wave will take us — we’ve only seen a fraction of its capabilities so far, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying,” Adam Maurer, COO at Connecting Software, a tech company operating across Europe, told TNW.\n\nIn recent years, Big Tech companies have frequently carried out mass layoffs, driven both by revenue concerns and the belief that AI can take over many of the functions of employees from entry to mid-level, Maurer said.\n\nSome of these AI-driven layoffs have effectively targeted low performers, but other initiatives have been problematic. At Klarna, for example, they had concerning impacts on the business.\n\nKlarna, a Swedish fintech company that fired 700 workers and replaced them with AI, recently announced it will hire humans back again. The company’s CEO admitted to having made a “mistake” when replacing workers with AI.\n\n“It’s very clear that AI will definitely replace some jobs,” Maurer said. “On the other side of the coin, I think it will make some other jobs far more valuable.”\n\nIn the EU, labour laws and regulations will shape the impact on jobs. Tech leaders believe they could lead to an AI future that benefits both workers and businesses.\n\nThe talk among executives\n\nMaurer said there may be some expectation for the EU to step in and regulate job displacement. However, he argued that would stagnate growth and discourage startups from doing business in the union.\n\nBut not every business leader agrees. Displacement will happen, but not because of AI, said Volodymyr Kubytskyi, head of AI at MacPaw, a Ukrainian software company developing solutions for Apple devices.\n\n“AI disrupts the traditional logic and processes of work,” Kubytskyi told TNW. “The real question is, ‘Can we redesign work processes before this outdated system collapses?’” To prevent the system from collapsing, leaders must stop thinking of AI as a quick-win or cost-saving tool, he said.\n\nKubytskyi argued that while the AI Act was necessary to set a baseline for the industry, it doesn’t account for potential job disruption, which is a gap in the regulatory landscape.\n\n“To account for this, the AI Act should be updated, but it’s unlikely that this will happen soon,” he said.\n\nRoman Eloshvili, founder of ComplyControl, a UK compliance company, told TNW that the AI Act targets safety, transparency, and ethics, but falls short on socio-economic impact, especially on jobs. “So, amendments are necessary,” he said.\n\n“I expect that, over time, some of them, such as mandates for employer-led upskilling or protections for displaced workers, will appear to address workforce implications more effectively.”\n\nWill the AI Act become outdated or even counterproductive, especially if its stringent compliance mechanisms amplify inequalities in access to AI benefits? Or is it too early in the game to amend the law?\n\nKris Jones, who leads the engineering team in Belfast for iVerify, believes it’s too soon to make changes. He said the AI Act’s risk-based framework already strikes a delicate balance between protecting fundamental rights and giving innovators room to breathe.\n\nAmending the regulation is not the only policy idea discussed among executives. Jones told TNW that member states have other levers to pull. “One idea floating around is an ‘AI token’ tax,” he said.\n\nA token tax would enable governments to generate revenue from AI usage that is producing income. These funds would then be redistributed through measures such as reskilling programs or support for affected industries.\n\nDario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, recently told Axios that the concept could offset the inevitable wipeout of millions of entry-level white-collar jobs lost to AI.\n\n“Measures like that can cushion any job shocks without putting a blanket lid on innovation,” Amodei said.\n\nAre clashes with European labour and trade unions inevitable?\n\nEuropean labour and trade union bodies have often been ignored in the debate over AI job displacement. But many of them have already made official statements expressing concerns over AI.\n\nAhead of the Paris AI Summit in February 2025, the ETUC, representing over 45 million European workers, issued an open letter about AI’s dangers. It warned that any efforts to ensure AI has “a positive impact on workers in the labour markets, quality jobs, and society will be annulled if AI is monopolised by a handful of tech companies”.\n\nThe previous August, UK unions, including Accord and Unite, had called for regulations to protect workers from AI. They also proposed reskilling programs for workers, reminded companies of their transparency obligations, and emphasised the need for union consultations. They said that they intended to protect workers’ rights against AI‑driven hiring and firing, as well as defend IP rights for creative professionals.\n\nWe asked tech firms whether they expect companies to face challenges with labour laws and unions in Europe.\n\n“Undoubtedly,” Eloshvili from ComplyControl said. “European robust worker protections and active unions present both a safeguard and challenges for AI integration.”\n\nUnions will demand transparency and worker involvement in AI deployment as automation threatens certain jobs, he said. “Firms that try to impose AI solutions without dialogue definitely risk conflict and backlash.”\n\nDespite the challenges, Eloshvili said it isn’t a zero-sum game. “When businesses and unions work together — for example, under joint upskilling initiatives — AI can become an effective tool for improving working conditions,” he said.\n\nKubytskyi from MacPaw agreed that challenges will arise on this front and described the pushback from unions and workers’ organisations as “understandable”.\n\n“Clarity, structure, and communication are vital,” he said. “If you integrate new [AI] agents into existing workflows without involving people, you’ll get pushback, and for a good reason.”\n\nKubytskyi also believes that conflict can be avoided. “To prevent this, we need to show people what AI does, what guardrails are in place, and why it will benefit the team.”\n\nJorge Riera, the CEO of big data and AI consultancy Dataco, agrees. “The most effective AI deployments are strategic,” he said, adding that careful analysis is needed to decipher which work tasks should be offloaded to AI.\n\nFlipping the script to develop AI the ‘European way’\n\nJones from iVerify explained that regulations, trade unions, and workers’ rights in Europe are not necessarily an obstacle and could, in fact, be beneficial.\n\nHe believes companies should embed responsible AI, bias checks, explainability, and human oversight loops into each product cycle. That way, they can transform the AI Act from a compliance hurdle into a market differentiator, Jones explained.\n\n“Europe can’t sit out the AI wave; the Bay Area now fields roughly half of the world’s unicorns and hoovers up 80% of GenAI funding, while much of the European workforce is ageing and a quarter of young Europeans can’t find work,” Jones said.\n\nEurope is not only facing competition from the usual suspects — Asia and the US — but also from Latin America, where heavy investment in technology is underway.\n\nMahesh Raja, chief growth officer of Ness Digital Engineering, which operates innovation centres in the UK and Czechia, highlighted how this lack of similar investment is hurting business. “Fifty-three percent of small- and medium-size businesses found the initial cost of AI implementation to be much higher than anticipated. We need to address the adoption challenges that stem from legacy IT infrastructures and improve the collective time-to-value for this emerging technology,” he said.\n\nHowever, Europe’s stringent regulations can become a premium brand for banks, healthtechs, and any sector that values trust and data privacy.\n\n”Europe shouldn’t just photocopy Silicon Valley,” Jones said. He believes the continent’s strengths lie in a combination of factors, including upskilling and STEM PhD graduates per capita. The privacy-first and safe AI leadership — solidified in regulation — can bolster the package.\n\n“Overall, Europe should push hard on AI augmentation and skill-building, or we’ll fall further behind,” Jones said. “But do it Europe’s way, leveraging our ethical governance, deep industrial know-how, and cross-border talent pipelines instead of importing the Valley’s blitz-and-break culture wholesale.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"jobs\", \"stifling\", \"work\", \"workers\", \"act\", \"told\", \"ai\", \"europe\", \"innovation\", \"unions\", \"labour\", \"protect\", \"eus\", \"jones\"]", "content_hash": "d5d63c25b67f85daae93803735f2880db3af5f7910d11a2d0bcb679009816f51", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:31:53.141941+00:00"}

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "The Oura Ring 4 (left) has receded sensors that make it more comfortable compared to Oura Ring 3 (right). Nina Raemont/ZDNET\n\nConsidering buying an Oura Ring to track your sleep, activity, or stress? Oura is taking up to $200 off its third-gen smart ring, depending on the finish and size. This deal applies to the Oura Ring Heritage and Oura Ring Horizon, two third-generation smart rings.\n\nAlso: The Oura Ring 4 is ZDNET's best product of the year\n\nThe deal on the earlier generation Oura Ring 3 is so low because Oura recently unveiled the Oura Ring 4. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive and well-designed smart ring that blows its competitors (and even the Ring 3) out of the water. But does that mean you should buy the newer Ring 4 over the less expensive Ring 3 that's on sale right now? It all depends on what features you prioritize in a smart ring. I break down the differences below.\n\nSpecifications\n\n\n\nOura Ring 3 Oura Ring 4 Battery life Up to seven days Up to eight days Charging time Between 20-80 minutes Between 20-80 minutes Sizes 6-13 4-15 Material Titanium exterior and epoxy interior Fully titanium Finishes Black, brushed titanium, gold, silver, rose gold Black, brushed silver, gold, silver, rose gold Starting price $300 $350\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 4 if...\n\n\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You prioritize comfort\n\nOne of the highlights of the new Oura Ring 4 is its smart sensors. Oura Ring 4's smart sensing technology uses 18 signal pathways, compared to the Oura Ring 3's eight, to capture more accurate data with fewer gaps.\n\nSo, what does that have to do with comfort? These smart sensors allow the raised sensor domes that stick out on the Oura Ring 3's interior to flatten and recede on the Oura Ring 4 for a more comfortable and less constrictive wear. I wore the Oura Ring 3 for around eight months, and one of the few gripes I had with it was that the three domes would cling to the inside of my finger, resulting in dents that remained on my skin for days after.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 4 for weeks. Here's why it's the best health tracker right now\n\nThe Oura Ring 4 is far more comfortable than the Oura Ring 3 thanks to the receded smart sensing technology. It's noticeably slimmer, both on the interior of the ring and the exterior, which results in a lighter feel. If you are more sensitive to health trackers around your wrist or finger and get easily annoyed with jewelry, I'd suggest the Oura Ring 4.\n\n2. You want a smaller or larger ring size\n\nSherin Shibu\n\nExpanded sizing is one of the major hardware upgrades that came with the Oura Ring 4. Where the Oura Ring 3 offers sizes six through 13, the Oura Ring 4 offers sizes four through 15. That's four more sizes on the larger and smaller ends of the spectrum. If you couldn't buy the Oura Ring 3 because the available sizes didn't fit your finger, the Oura Ring 4 might fit you better.\n\n3. You want a longer battery life\n\nThe Oura Ring 3 boasts a battery life of up to seven days, though I normally got around four. The newer Oura Ring 4 boasts a battery life of up to eight days, but during my testing I got around 5 and a half.\n\nIf you forget to charge your tech constantly and want a smart ring that you can put on for a few days and not worry about, then I'd recommend the Oura Ring 4. If you are adamant about daily charging, however, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3.\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 3 if...\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You just want the newest software\n\nMost of the software updates that came to the Oura Ring 4 also are available on the Oura Ring 3. That includes automatic heart rate monitoring during workouts, the Oura app redesign, upgraded daytime stress features that help contextualize your physiological stress, and many new Oura Labs features you can test out, like meal logging.\n\nAutomatic heart rate monitoring continues Oura's mission of autonomously logging health data with little assistance from the ring wearer. This means that, on top of the automatic workout detection feature, the Oura Ring now can monitor and record your heart rate during these activities without you clicking on the Record workout HR button.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 3 -- and it totally beat my Apple Watch\n\nOura upgraded its daytime stress feature by implementing the daily tags people use to document their meals, workouts, illnesses, and moods onto the daytime stress timeline. Let's say you just had an argument with a coworker and find that your heart rate is elevated. If you log that in the app, it will include that tag into the daytime stress timeline.\n\nLastly, there are a few experimental features Oura Ring 3 users can take advantage of through Oura Labs, which is also available on both rings. One of my favorite features I tested was the meal-logging feature that uses your camera and AI to document what you're eating (and when).\n\nThe AI was able to detect that I was eating yogurt with berries and bananas one morning, despite the yogurt being fully picked over and mixed with the other ingredients.\n\n2. You don't want to spend more money\n\nYou can buy an Oura Ring 3 for up to $200 right now. The third-generation smart ring has been on sale since Oura unveiled a newer generation. If a starting price of $350 (plus that $6 monthly subscription to access all your data) is a little too much for you, the Oura Ring 3 is substantially cheaper.\n\n3. Comfort isn't a concern\n\nIf you own an Oura Ring 3 and aren't disturbed by the raised sensors or the chunkier build, I don't see a need for you to upgrade to the Oura Ring 4. If you don't own either ring and are trying to make a buying decision, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3 if you are unbothered by a tight and raised dome around your finger.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"sizes\", \"vs\", \"buy\", \"right\", \"oura\", \"features\", \"days\", \"sensors\", \"older\", \"newest\", \"discounted\", \"smart\", \"ring\", \"stress\", \"opt\"]", "content_hash": "8bfe6d67475ef7abdc53eeb95171bbca33677b332ccb0bbadccb85f08b2f9891", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:00.634234+00:00"}

Amazon Echo speakers are the best way to bring Alexa into your smart home. The Echo Pop and Echo Dot, Amazon's two most compact smart speakers, are the most popular and affordable Echo devices available.\n\nAmazon's new Alexa+ is launching gradually over the next few weeks. While the company is prioritizing the larger Echo Shows in the initial release, Amazon says that after you get access to Alexa+ on an Echo Show 8,10,15, or 21, it will be available on all of your Echo devices, with the exception of some older generations.\n\nAlso: Amazon just gave Alexa its biggest upgrade in a decade - and old Echo devices will support it\n\nThe Echo Pop is newer than the Echo Dot and is marketed as the company's most compact speaker. At about two-thirds of the size of the already compact Echo Dot, the Echo Pop is best suited for small rooms and can be tucked away in the corner of a desk. The slightly larger Echo Dot is about the size of an Apple HomePod mini and delivers more potent sound.\n\nRead on to learn more about how the Echo Pop and Echo Dot compare and which is best suited for which sort of user.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Pop if...\n\n\n\nHere's an Amazon Echo Pop next to an Apple Magic Mouse, for reference. Maria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need a compact speaker\n\nThe Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and most affordable smart speaker, perfect for a small room -- such as a dorm or a kid's room. Because it doesn't feature a screen and can go unnoticed, it's a simple way to introduce yourself to the Alexa ecosystem or give someone access to Amazon's voice assistant in a simple, unintimidating way.\n\nReview: Amazon Echo Pop review: A portable smart speaker for small spaces\n\nThe Echo Pop is a perfect option if you're looking for a compact speaker for your kid's desk, a guest room, or an area you don't use often. It can be unreliable in larger rooms or when tasked with bigger assignments, which brings me to my next point.\n\n2. You plan on everyday music streaming, podcasts, or audiobooks\n\nThe Echo Pop is surprisingly loud, but the sound quality decreases greatly when the volume increases. This is why the Echo Pop is meant for smaller rooms and is much less expensive than other Echo devices.\n\nAlso: The best smart home devices\n\nThe Echo Pop won't be the life of the party at a backyard barbecue. Still, it's excellent for listening to music informally when hanging out in your room, catching up on your favorite podcasts, and listening to audiobooks. Having Alexa built-in makes it more enticing, as you can use the AI-powered voice assistant to control smart devices around your home.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Dot if...\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need Alexa to be more reliable\n\nBecause the Echo Pop is a smaller, more affordable smart speaker than the Echo Dot, it's also less reliable. The Echo Dot is more responsive and can easily hear me from across the room, whether it's playing music or not.\n\nThe Echo Pop, in turn, appears to have a simpler microphone array that is easily overpowered by high volumes. I've often found Alexa unable to hear me on the Echo Pop when the volume is too high, which can be frustrating, especially because it doesn't have an action button.\n\nAlso: Here's how to use Alexa Plus for free - especially if you're an Amazon Prime member\n\nThe Echo Dot features a volume-up button, a volume-down button, a mute button, and an action button. The last one is a great way to wake Alexa without talking to it, which would be nice in the Echo Pop when it can't hear me. I've resorted to unplugging the Echo Pop when it can't hear me, so it stops blasting \"The Wheels on the Bus.\"\n\n2. You want room-filling sound\n\nThe Echo Dot isn't a high-end speaker, but it is great for most users. It can deliver room-filling sound from a small package, as the audio doesn't deteriorate as much as the Echo Pop's when the volume goes up. For example, you can pair two Echo Dots to function as external speakers for a TV and get stereo sound better than audio from most inexpensive TVs.\n\nAlso: Not all Echo devices will get Alexa Plus - see if yours made the list\n\nAs a device often discounted during Prime Day and holiday sales events for around half off, I'd recommend the Echo Dot to most users looking for a reliable smart speaker with Alexa built-in that can deliver sound from all directions.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"smart\", \"vs\", \"devices\", \"dot\", \"pop\", \"speaker\", \"alexa\", \"choose\", \"amazon\", \"echo\", \"room\", \"compact\"]", "content_hash": "98bade5b9872cfa69029fa4b6b1d966decd58db1114183116401f58f5ba92fcd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:01.407452+00:00"}

You can instantly sign up for its free plan and build your first campaign. With step-by-step buttons on its dashboard, like importing or creating your contact list, connecting an integration, and importing your brand persona, your first round of emails or SMS campaign will be ready in no time.\n\nHere, you can either start from scratch or use a campaign template. The drag-and-drop editor makes the entire setup process easy, though the free templates are pretty barebones unless you upgrade. The automation builder can trigger emails based on sign-ups, tags, events, or custom criteria you set. I tested both prebuilt and custom journeys, and while it takes a few minutes to learn the flow, it's flexible and powerful once you do. That said, Classic Automations were discontinued in mid-2025 by Mailchimp, so if you're coming back to the platform after a while, expect to rebuild from scratch and pay for something that used to be free.\n\nMoreover, Mailchimp's dashboard actually recommends flows based on common goals like welcoming new contacts, sharing content with Meta leads, or sending birthday discounts. These flows save serious time for basic tasks like recovering abandoned carts or nurturing repeat buyers. The thing is, on the Free plan, you can preview them, but you'll need to upgrade to actually launch them. Still, it's nice to see what's possible before committing. Setting up a flow is visual, i.e., more drag-and-drop than techy, which makes it approachable, even if you've never done automation before. Once you understand how triggers and actions work together, you can build out surprisingly complex sequences.\n\nPlans start free with 500 contacts, then scale based on list size.

Why we like it: It's an excellent solution for starting out in the CRM world or for experienced users looking to transition to an advanced CRM. The Salesforce Starter CRM package comes with almost everything you could want to kick-start your journey with the software. Features available from the outset include account, contact, task, and lead management. It also includes Salesforce Meetings, marketing and email templates, campaign assistance, data analytics, e-commerce website design, onboarding, and payment facilitation. Recently, Salesforce launched a new solution to improve AI agents used to help human productivity. Who it's for: Businesses of any size, large or small. I like the simple nature of Salesforce plans, with one option for small and midsize businesses and another for enterprises, priced at $25 and $100 per user per month, respectively. Who should look elsewhere: Many Salesforce Starter CRM customers are impressed with the services offered, though some note the high price for enterprise users. Some features, including advanced automation and access to AppExchange -- the Salesforce app marketplace -- are limited to premium subscribers. There also isn't a middle ground plan between the Starter and Pro Suites, and this might deter some people. Microsoft Dynamics CRM could be a great alternative.

Why we like it: The name may give it away somewhat, as the Pipedrive CRM platform has been developed to streamline and improve sales processes. To name but a few features available to help organizations reach their sales goals, you can manage sales leads, contacts, pipelines, and email marketing yourself, and you can also automate sales-related tasks such as follow-up emails and call scheduling. There's also an AI-based sales assistant worth exploring, as well as report generation and task scheduling. Another interesting feature is a system that rates how \"hot\" a lead is, based on publicly available data. Pipedrive recently released Pulse, a sales prospecting toolkit for small businesses looking to automate and streamline pipelines. Who it's for: Business users who want to revitalize their existing customer relationship management processes with a fresh approach to sales and retention. Pipedrive customers also say there isn't a steep learning curve, and they report that the service is backed by solid customer support. You can take advantage of a 14-day trial. Paid plans start at $14 per seat per month for the Lite package. To experience the full benefit of this CRM for sales, I'd recommend the professional, Premium plan at $49 per seat per month. Who should look elsewhere: Interested parties who aren't heavily focused on sales.

Why we like it: HubSpot is a great way to learn how CRM software can benefit your business. You can take advantage of the HubSpot free plan, which requires only an email address sign-up and a short verification process. While testing out this CRM, I found the walk-through and guides to different parts of the platform very useful. If you're unsure how to use a CRM platform, HubSpot will point you in the right direction, and its tutorials will help you learn about each section without too much stress. You can use HubSpot for a variety of tasks, such as organizing and managing marketing, customer contact records, website development, and customer support, among many other use cases. Paid plans begin at $15 per seat per month for starter plans, which I consider affordable and a good value for the money. However, subscriptions to advanced plans quickly escalate in price. Recently, HubSpot launched a deep research connector with ChatGPT for business predictions and analytics, alongside a connector for Anthropic's Claude, a chatbot AI assistant. Who it's for: This is a fair solution with a free tier if you're new to the CRM world, with many smaller outfits reporting that they're happy with the system. However, some also note that the costs can quickly escalate if you want advanced features. Who should look elsewhere: Though you'll find that the basic, free CRM can be used for tasks such as contact management and email marketing, some things are limited to paid plans, including features like automation, sales lead generation, and helpdesk functions, as well as some reporting options. So, if you later feel like you need these options, you'll either need to upgrade or look elsewhere.

Though the overall classifications of different types of CRM software vary from vendor to vendor, the same themes appear. You may want to research the major types of CRM before you make a purchase decision, as that may influence how your business grows. Operational: Most modern CRM platforms offer some kind of operational mechanism or module. Operational CRMs tend to focus on optimizing business operations, including sales processes, logistics, and customer communications. Operational CRMs may be particularly useful for startups and small and midsize businesses looking to scale. Analytical/data-driven: Other CRMs focus on the intrinsic value of data. Businesses able to handle, securely store, and analyze customer data -- always useful if held in a centralized, organized platform -- can draw insights and see patterns that may influence their future sales activities or reveal new revenue streams. Furthermore, data-driven CRMs may reveal ways to improve customer relationships and retention. Collaborative: Collaborative CRMs provide organizations with a way to enhance collaboration and productivity. CRM suites can be used to create department channels and data repositories, allowing different teams to work together and to share information. For instance, a sales team could collaborate with marketing and finance to create new customer promotions and campaigns. Customer service teams, too, can access important records to track customer journeys and resolve issues.

Below are some basic recommendations for integrating your new CRM software effectively: Plan and assess: Research and assess the needs of your business and whether the CRM solution you're considering will provide a return on your investment. Consider the type of CRM you need, your primary reason for using a CRM, how many seats you'll need, and whether you need collaborative functions to integrate the CRM with different departments, such as marketing or customer service.\n\nResearch and assess the needs of your business and whether the CRM solution you're considering will provide a return on your investment. Consider the type of CRM you need, your primary reason for using a CRM, how many seats you'll need, and whether you need collaborative functions to integrate the CRM with different departments, such as marketing or customer service. Existing systems: Consider whether there are existing, legacy systems that the CRM will replace. If there are apps you want the CRM to integrate with, you may also need to check compatibility requirements and support. It may also be important to create new policies, especially around data and security.\n\nConsider whether there are existing, legacy systems that the CRM will replace.

The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.\n\nCato Networks’ researcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren’t isolated occurrences, and that Russia’s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.\n\nMost startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nThe rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report reveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato’s researchers observe in the report, “most notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.”\n\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfare\n\nResearchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face’s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model.\n\nThe legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (Додаток.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background. This official-looking PDF about cybersecurity measures from the Security Service of Ukraine serves as a decoy while the malware performs its reconnaissance operations. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\nAPT28’s approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of “curly naked women” as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.\n\nThe provocative image generation prompts used by APT28’s image.py variant, including ‘Curvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face’, are designed to occupy victims’ attention during document theft. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\n“Russia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,” explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. “This is the first in the wild that was captured.”\n\nA quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malware\n\nSimonovich’s Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28’s deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls “Immersive World,” he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.\n\nThe method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.\n\n“I slowly walked him throughout my goal,” Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. “First, ‘Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.’ Then, ‘Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'”\n\nSix hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.\n\nWelcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy\n\nDuring his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.\n\nTo explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.\n\nAnother platform, Nytheon AI, revealed even less operational security. “I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn’t care about OpSec,” Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: “Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.”\n\nThese aren’t proof-of-concepts. They’re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer “Claude Code” clones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.\n\nEnterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surface\n\nCato Networks’ recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren’t pilot programs; they’re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn’t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.\n\nSimonovich told VentureBeat that vendors’ responses to Cato’s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world’s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.\n\nWhen Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:\n\nDeepSeek never responded\n\nGoogle declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples\n\nMicrosoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work\n\nOpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn’t engage further\n\nSix Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack\n\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn’t a warning; it’s proof that Simonovich’s research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.\n\nThe metrics are stark—270 stolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms offer identical capabilities for $250 per month. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.\n\nEnterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per Cato’s 2025 CTRL Threat Report. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.\n\nSimonovich’s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it’s an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.\n\nToday’s adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity. The weapons are already inside every organization, and today they’re called productivity tools.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"cato\", \"simonovich\", \"enterprise\", \"tools\", \"security\", \"ukraine\", \"defense\", \"malware\", \"threat\", \"ai\", \"actor\", \"venturebeat\", \"lamehug\", \"perimeter\", \"end\"]", "content_hash": "245600ead84199e16252d0bd2b99aff8fb1291969309474c3d19c7ef34b0a34f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:07.411054+00:00"}

LFM2-VL-1.6B — a more capable model that remains lightweight enough for single-GPU and device-based deployment.\n\nBoth variants process images at native resolutions up to 512×512 pixels, avoiding distortion or unnecessary upscaling.\n\nFor larger images, the system applies non-overlapping patching and adds a thumbnail for global context, enabling the model to capture both fine detail and the broader scene.\n\nBackground on Liquid AI\n\nLiquid AI was founded by former researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) with the goal of building AI architectures that move beyond the widely used transformer model.\n\nThe company’s flagship innovation, the Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs), are based on principles from dynamical systems, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra, producing general-purpose AI models capable of handling text, video, audio, time series, and other sequential data.\n\nUnlike traditional architectures, Liquid’s approach aims to deliver competitive or superior performance using significantly fewer computational resources, allowing for real-time adaptability during inference while maintaining low memory requirements. This makes LFMs well suited for both large-scale enterprise use cases and resource-limited edge deployments.\n\nIn July 2025, the company expanded its platform strategy with the launch of the Liquid Edge AI Platform (LEAP), a cross-platform SDK designed to make it easier for developers to run small language models directly on mobile and embedded devices.\n\nLEAP offers OS-agnostic support for iOS and Android, integration with both Liquid’s own models and other open-source SLMs, and a built-in library with models as small as 300MB—small enough for modern phones with minimal RAM.\n\nIts companion app, Apollo, enables developers to test models entirely offline, aligning with Liquid AI’s emphasis on privacy-preserving, low-latency AI. Together, LEAP and Apollo reflect the company’s commitment to decentralizing AI execution, reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure, and empowering developers to build optimized, task-specific models for real-world environments.\n\nSpeed/quality trade-offs and technical design\n\nLFM2-VL uses a modular architecture combining a language model backbone, a SigLIP2 NaFlex vision encoder, and a multimodal projector.\n\nThe projector includes a two-layer MLP connector with pixel unshuffle, reducing the number of image tokens and improving throughput.\n\nUsers can adjust parameters such as the maximum number of image tokens or patches, allowing them to balance speed and quality depending on the deployment scenario. The training process involved approximately 100 billion multimodal tokens, sourced from open datasets and in-house synthetic data.\n\nPerformance and benchmarks\n\nThe models achieve competitive benchmark results across a range of vision-language evaluations. LFM2-VL-1.6B scores well in RealWorldQA (65.23), InfoVQA (58.68), and OCRBench (742), and maintains solid results in multimodal reasoning tasks.\n\nIn inference testing, LFM2-VL achieved the fastest GPU processing times in its class when tested on a standard workload of a 1024×1024 image and short prompt.\n\nLicensing and availability\n\nLFM2-VL models are available now on Hugging Face, along with example fine-tuning code in Colab. They are compatible with Hugging Face transformers and TRL.\n\nThe models are released under a custom “LFM1.0 license”. Liquid AI has described this license as based on Apache 2.0 principles, but the full text has not yet been published.\n\nThe company has indicated that commercial use will be permitted under certain conditions, with different terms for companies above and below $10 million in annual revenue.\n\nWith LFM2-VL, Liquid AI aims to make high-performance multimodal AI more accessible for on-device and resource-limited deployments, without sacrificing capability.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"liquid\", \"multimodal\", \"model\", \"ai\", \"smartphones\", \"wants\", \"models\", \"inference\", \"image\", \"competitive\", \"lfm2vl\", \"fast\", \"visionlanguage\", \"small\"]", "content_hash": "2e837152b6d2cd363330786e2515f04d06676e6aefc24fa8ca94b2c1b52286af", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:08.021798+00:00"}

We will first make sure that current paying ChatGPT users get more total usage than they did before GPT-5.\n\n\n\n2. We will then prioritize API demand up to the… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 12, 2025\n\nHe said the company’s first priority is ensuring that current paying ChatGPT users receive more total usage than they had before GPT-5’s release, though he did not provide specific figures for the increase.\n\nHowever, Altman previously posted on X that OpenAI was “trying” a 3,000 messages-per-week usage limit when using the GPT-5 “thinking” mode, more reasoning power and time spent reasoning on harder problems, for ChatGPT Plus subscribers (the $20 per month plan).\n\ntrying 3000 per week now! — Sam Altman (@sama) August 10, 2025\n\nInterestingly, one report from an AI app creator on X said that OpenAI told him the usage limits for GPT-5 plus thinking on the ChatGPT Team plan ($30 per user per month) is much lower than that of ChatGPT Plus users, only 200 “Thinking” messages per week when selected manually by the user.\n\nOpenAI just replied to me with an email about the GPT-5 usage limits under the Team plan：\n\n\n\n· ChatGPT Team can manually select GPT-5-Thinking\n\n\n\n· Manual usage cap: 200 messages/week\n\n\n\n· On reaching cap: popup alert, GPT-5-Thinking hidden from menu — Vic Zhang (@RealVicHere) August 12, 2025\n\nOpenAI’s availability of GPT-5 through its application programming interface (API) for third-party developers is also being tweaked.\n\nAltman also stated in his X post that OpenAI would “prioritize API demand up to the currently allocated capacity and commitments we’ve made to customers.”\n\nIn other words, existing API users and those already in contract will get the first dibs on GPT-5 access through OpenAI’s API, others may have to wait longer.\n\nAltman also clarified “we can support about an additional ~30% new API growth from where we are today with this capacity,” meaning they can take on more API users, but not too many.\n\nWhile OpenAI hasn’t definitively shared how many users of its API there are in some time, the company did say it has “5 million” businesses paying for access to ChatGPT.\n\nAltman also said OpenAI plans to roughly double its compute fleet over the next five months. He did not specify the current size or type of infrastructure involved, but indicated the expansion should ease capacity constraints and improve performance for both ChatGPT and API users.\n\nI’ve reached out to OpenAI to ask for more specifics on the above numbers — 30% API growth up from what? doubling the compute fleet up from what? — and will update when I hear back.\n\nNew options for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users to search across Microsoft Teams and more…\n\nAlso last night, OpenAI updated its ChatGPT release notes online to allow subscribers of ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) to connect the application to search for files and projects across their third-party accounts on Box, Canva, Dropbox, HubSpot, Notion, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams.\n\nAnd just a few moments ago, OpenAI again updated the service to allow connections for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts to Pro users first, followed by Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plans.\n\nFor example, ChatGPT users can search their Gmail for all emails matching a certain query, Dropbox account or Notion workspace during a conversation without toggling over into those separate apps.\n\nIn addition, subscribers to the ChatGPT Pro tier ($200 per month) may now link their accounts to Microsoft Teams and GitHub connectors and search those third-party applications.\n\nThese join OpenAI’s previous connectors to Gmail, Google Drive and Google Calendar, among other apps.\n\nThe individual user/account holder first needs to manually connect these external accounts to ChatGPT.\n\nTo do so, they’ll need to:\n\nClick on their account name in the lower left corner of the web interface Click “Settings” from the pop up menu and then… Click “Connectors from the left sidebar menu. This should pull up a gallery view of available external apps and icons. Screenshots below.\n\nUnfortunately, these connectors are not available for Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe new connectors are currently in beta and disabled by default for Enterprise and Education plans, though administrators can enable them in settings.\n\nBalancing supply and demand\n\nBy combining capacity planning with new productivity integrations, OpenAI is positioning GPT-5 not only as a more powerful AI model but also as part of a more connected workspace.\n\nThe staged approach to compute allocation reflects the company’s effort to serve existing customers first while scaling up for future demand.\n\nAs the compute expansion comes online, paying users stand to benefit first from both higher availability and more ways to integrate ChatGPT into their daily workflows.\n\nBut first, OpenAI needs to stabilize its release and ensure GPT-5 is working smoothly for all the users who want it.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"thirdparty\", \"dropbox\", \"teams\", \"connectors\", \"users\", \"openai\", \"api\", \"prioritization\", \"gpt5\", \"chatgpt\", \"usage\", \"compute\", \"clarifies\", \"pro\", \"ms\", \"plus\", \"tool\"]", "content_hash": "00899e983f3f3a3a556b8fee19d88059e7bc6f78cac1d3dd78bdf898b13bcf1b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:08.641449+00:00"}

With the new capacity, developers can load codebases containing more than 75,000 lines of code, enabling Claude to understand complete project architecture and suggest improvements across entire systems rather than individual files.\n\nThe announcement comes as Anthropic faces intensifying competition from OpenAI and Google, both of which already offer similar context windows. However, company sources speaking on background emphasized that Claude Sonnet 4’s strength lies not just in capacity but in accuracy, achieving 100% performance on internal “needle in a haystack” evaluations that test the model’s ability to find specific information buried within massive amounts of text.\n\nHow developers can now analyze entire codebases with AI in one request\n\nThe extended context capability addresses a fundamental limitation that has constrained AI-powered software development. Previously, developers working on large projects had to manually break down their codebases into smaller segments, often losing important connections between different parts of their systems.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

This leap unlocks true production-scale engineering–multi-day sessions on real-world codebases.”\n\nEric Simons, CEO of Bolt.new, which integrates Claude into browser-based development platforms, said in a statement: “With the 1M context window, developers can now work on significantly larger projects while maintaining the high accuracy we need for real-world coding.”\n\nThe expanded context enables three primary use cases that were previously difficult or impossible: comprehensive code analysis across entire repositories, document synthesis involving hundreds of files while maintaining awareness of relationships between them, and context-aware AI agents that can maintain coherence across hundreds of tool calls and complex workflows.\n\nWhy Claude’s new pricing strategy could reshape the AI development market\n\nAnthropic has adjusted its pricing structure to reflect the increased computational requirements of processing larger contexts. While prompts of 200,000 tokens or fewer maintain current pricing at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, larger prompts cost $6 and $22.50 respectively.\n\nThe pricing strategy reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry. Recent analysis shows that Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than OpenAI’s newly launched GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating pressure on enterprise procurement teams to balance performance against cost.\n\nHowever, Anthropic argues the decision should factor in quality and usage patterns rather than price alone. Company sources noted that prompt caching — which stores frequently accessed large datasets — can make long context cost-competitive with traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation approaches, especially for enterprises that repeatedly query the same information.\n\n“Large context lets Claude see everything and choose what’s relevant, often producing better answers than pre-filtered RAG results where you might miss important connections between documents,” an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat.\n\nAnthropic’s billion-dollar dependency on just two major coding customers\n\nThe long context capability arrives as Anthropic commands 42% of the AI code generation market, more than double OpenAI’s 21% share according to a Menlo Ventures survey of 150 enterprise technical leaders. However, this dominance comes with risks: industry analysis suggests that coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot drive approximately $1.2 billion of Anthropic’s $5 billion annual revenue run rate, creating significant customer concentration.\n\nThe GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. While GitHub Copilot currently relies on Claude for key functionality, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.\n\nThe timing of the context expansion is strategic. Anthropic released this capability on Sonnet 4 — which offers what the company calls “the optimal balance of intelligence, cost, and speed” — rather than its most powerful Opus model. Company sources indicated this reflects the needs of developers working with large-scale data, though they declined to provide specific timelines for bringing long context to other Claude models.\n\nInside Claude’s breakthrough AI memory technology and emerging safety risks\n\nThe 1 million token context window represents significant technical advancement in AI memory and attention mechanisms. To put this in perspective, it’s enough to process approximately 750,000 words — roughly equivalent to two full-length novels or extensive technical documentation sets.\n\nAnthropic’s internal testing revealed perfect recall performance across diverse scenarios, a crucial capability as context windows expand. The company embedded specific information within massive text volumes and tested Claude’s ability to find and use those details when answering questions.\n\nHowever, the expanded capabilities also raise safety considerations. Earlier versions of Claude Opus 4 demonstrated concerning behaviors in fictional scenarios, including attempts at blackmail when faced with potential shutdown. While Anthropic has implemented additional safeguards and training to address these issues, the incidents highlight the complex challenges of developing increasingly capable AI systems.\n\nFortune 500 companies rush to adopt Claude’s expanded context capabilities\n\nThe feature rollout is initially limited to Anthropic API customers with Tier 4 and custom rate limits, with broader availability planned over coming weeks. Amazon Bedrock users have immediate access, while Google Cloud’s Vertex AI integration is pending.\n\nEarly enterprise response has been enthusiastic, according to company sources. Use cases span from coding teams analyzing entire repositories to financial services firms processing comprehensive transaction datasets to legal startups conducting contract analysis that previously required manual document segmentation.\n\n“This is one of our most requested features from API customers,” an Anthropic spokesperson said. “We’re seeing excitement across industries that unlocks true agentic capabilities, with customers now running multi-day coding sessions on real-world codebases that would have been impossible with context limitations before.”\n\nThe development also enables more sophisticated AI agents that can maintain context across complex, multi-step workflows. This capability becomes particularly valuable as enterprises move beyond simple AI chat interfaces toward autonomous systems that can handle extended tasks with minimal human intervention.\n\nThe long context announcement intensifies competition among leading AI providers. Google’s older Gemini 1.5 Pro model and OpenAI’s older GPT-4.1 model both offer 1 million token windows, but Anthropic argues that Claude’s superior performance on coding and reasoning tasks provides competitive advantage even at higher prices.\n\nThe broader AI industry has seen explosive growth in model API spending, which doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months according to Menlo Ventures. Enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to newer models within weeks regardless of cost, suggesting that technical capabilities often outweigh pricing considerations in procurement decisions.\n\nHowever, OpenAI’s recent aggressive pricing strategy with GPT-5 could reshape these dynamics. Early comparisons show dramatic price advantages that may overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures as AI adoption scales.\n\nFor Anthropic, maintaining its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources remains critical. The company has tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.\n\nAs AI systems become capable of processing and reasoning about increasingly vast amounts of information, they’re fundamentally changing how developers approach complex software projects. The ability to maintain context across entire codebases represents a shift from AI as a coding assistant to AI as a comprehensive development partner that understands the full scope and interconnections of large-scale projects.\n\nThe implications extend far beyond software development. Industries from legal services to financial analysis are beginning to recognize that AI systems capable of maintaining context across hundreds of documents could transform how organizations process and understand complex information relationships.\n\nBut with great capability comes great responsibility—and risk. As these systems become more powerful, the incidents of concerning AI behavior during Anthropic’s testing serve as a reminder that the race to expand AI capabilities must be balanced with careful attention to safety and control.\n\nAs Claude learns to juggle a million pieces of information simultaneously, Anthropic faces its own context window problem: being trapped between OpenAI’s pricing pressure and Microsoft’s conflicting loyalties.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"entire\", \"single\", \"claude\", \"context\", \"coding\", \"pricing\", \"million\", \"developers\", \"ai\", \"request\", \"projects\", \"complex\", \"company\", \"software\", \"anthropic\", \"process\"]", "content_hash": "1461699fbf20af20c37137f5325b11bc9f163f8f28592d3ab09a27a1c8f52504", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:09.284777+00:00"}

Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nThe fragility of point-and-click AI agents\n\nComputer use agents typically rely on vision-language and vision-language-action models (VLMs or VLAs) to perceive a screen and take action, mimicking how a person uses a mouse and keyboard.\n\nWhile these GUI-based agents can perform a variety of tasks, they often falter when faced with long, complex workflows, especially in applications with dense menus and options, like office productivity suites.\n\nFor example, a task that involves locating a specific table in a spreadsheet, filtering it, and saving it as a new file can involve a long and precise sequence of GUI manipulations.\n\nThis is where brittleness creeps in. “In these scenarios, existing agents frequently struggle with visual grounding ambiguity (e.g., distinguishing between visually similar icons or menu items) and the accumulated probability of making any single error over the long horizon,” the researchers write in their paper. “A single mis-click or misunderstood UI element can derail the entire task.”\n\nTo address these challenges, many researchers have focused on augmenting GUI agents with high-level planners.\n\nThese systems use powerful reasoning models like OpenAI’s o3 to decompose a user’s high-level goal into a sequence of smaller, more manageable subtasks.\n\nWhile this structured approach improves performance, it doesn’t solve the problem of navigating menus and clicking buttons, even for operations that could be done more directly and reliably with a few lines of code.\n\nCoAct-1: A multi-agent team for computer tasks\n\nTo solve these limitations, the researchers created CoAct-1 (Computer-using Agent with Coding as Actions), a system designed to “combine the intuitive, human-like strengths of GUI manipulation with the precision, reliability, and efficiency of direct system interaction through code.”\n\nThe system is structured as a team of three specialized agents that work together: an Orchestrator, a Programmer, and a GUI Operator.\n\nCoAct-1 framework (source: arXiv)\n\nThe Orchestrator acts as the central planner or project manager. It analyzes the user’s overall goal, breaks it down into subtasks, and assigns each subtask to the best agent for the job. It can delegate backend operations like file management or data processing to the Programmer, which writes and executes Python or Bash scripts.\n\nFor frontend tasks that require clicking buttons or navigating visual interfaces, it turns to the GUI Operator, a VLM-based agent.\n\n“This dynamic delegation allows CoAct-1 to strategically bypass inefficient GUI sequences in favor of robust, single-shot code execution where appropriate, while still leveraging visual interaction for tasks where it is indispensable,” the paper states.\n\nThe workflow is iterative. After the Programmer or GUI Operator completes a subtask, it sends a summary and a screenshot of the current system state back to the Orchestrator, which then decides the next step or concludes the task.\n\nThe Programmer agent uses an LLM to generate its code and sends commands to a code interpreter to test and refine its code over multiple rounds.\n\nSimilarly, the GUI Operator uses an action interpreter that executes its commands (e.g., mouse clicks, typing) and returns the resulting screenshot, allowing it to see the outcome of its actions. The Orchestrator makes the final decision on whether the task should continue or stop.\n\nExample of CoAct-1 in action (source: arXiv)\n\nA more efficient path to automation\n\nThe researchers tested CoAct-1 on OSWorld, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 369 real-world tasks across browsers, IDEs, and office applications.\n\nThe results show CoAct-1 establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving a success rate of 60.76%.\n\nThe performance gains were most significant in categories where programmatic control offers a clear advantage, such as OS-level tasks and multi-application workflows.\n\nFor instance, consider an OS-level task like finding all image files within a complex folder structure, resizing them, and then compressing the entire directory into a single archive.\n\nA purely GUI-based agent would need to perform a long, brittle sequence of clicks and drags, opening folders, selecting files, and navigating menus, with a high chance of error at each step.\n\nCoAct-1, by contrast, can delegate this entire workflow to its Programmer agent, which can accomplish the task with a single, robust script.\n\nBeyond just a higher success rate, the system is dramatically more efficient. CoAct-1 solves tasks in an average of just 10.15 steps, a stark contrast to the 15.22 steps required by leading GUI-only agents like GTA-1.\n\nWhile other agents like OpenAI’s CUA 4o averaged fewer steps, their overall success rate was much lower, indicating CoAct-1’s efficiency is coupled with greater effectiveness.\n\nThe researchers found a clear trend: tasks that require more actions are more likely to fail. Reducing the number of steps not only speeds up task completion but, more importantly, minimizes the opportunities for error.\n\nTherefore, finding ways to compress multiple GUI steps into a single programmatic task can make the process both more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nAs the researchers conclude, “This efficiency underscores the potential of our approach to pave a more robust and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.”\n\nCoAct-1 performs tasks with fewer steps on average thanks to smart use of coding (source: arXiv)\n\nFrom the lab to the enterprise workflow\n\nThe potential for this technology goes beyond general productivity. For enterprise leaders, the key lies in automating complex, multi-tool processes where full API access is a luxury, not a guarantee.\n\nRan Xu, a co-author of the paper and Director of Applied AI Research at Salesforce, points to customer support as a prime example.\n\n“A service support agent uses many different tools — general tools such as Salesforce, industry-specific tools such as EPIC for healthcare, and a lot of customized tools — to investigate a customer request and formulate a response,” Xu told VentureBeat. “Some of the tools have API access while others don’t. It is a perfect use case that could potentially benefit from our technology: a compute-use agent that leverages whatever is available from the computer, whether it’s an API, code, or just the screen.”\n\nXu also sees high-value applications in sales, such as prospecting at scale and automating bookkeeping, and in marketing for tasks like customer segmentation and campaign asset generation.\n\nNavigating real-world challenges and the need for human oversight\n\nWhile the results on the OSWorld benchmark are strong, enterprise environments are far messier, filled with legacy software and unpredictable UIs.\n\nThis raises critical questions about robustness, security, and the need for human oversight.\n\nA core challenge is ensuring the Orchestrator agent makes the right choice when faced with an unfamiliar application. According to Xu, the path to making agents like CoAct-1 robust for custom enterprise software involves training them with feedback in realistic, simulated environments.\n\nThe goal is to create a system where the “agent could observe how human agents work, get trained within a sandbox, and when it goes live, continue to solve tasks under the guidance and guardrail of a human agent.”\n\nThe ability for the Programmer agent to execute its own code also introduces obvious security concerns. What stops the agent from executing harmful code based on an ambiguous user request?\n\nXu confirms that robust containment is essential. “Access control and sandboxing is the key,” he said, emphasizing that a human must “understand the implication and give the AI access for safety.”\n\nSandboxing and guardrails will be critical to validating agent behavior before deployment on critical systems.\n\nUltimately, for the foreseeable future, overcoming ambiguity will likely require a human-in-the-loop. When asked about handling vague user queries, a concern also raised in the paper, Xu suggested a phased approach. “I see human-in-the-loop to start,” he noted.\n\nWhile some tasks may eventually become fully autonomous, for high-stakes operations, human validation will remain crucial. “Some mission-critical ones may always need human approval.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"tasks\", \"write\", \"greater\", \"faster\", \"code\", \"coact1\", \"dont\", \"steps\", \"task\", \"salesforces\", \"gui\", \"system\", \"human\", \"success\", \"agent\", \"agents\", \"rates\", \"point\"]", "content_hash": "a3a3ad3e18349a700676a469c381925d1da8fffce7bce81568c6b8c12c5c72b1", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:09.903723+00:00"}

However, when it comes to agents and AI applications, many banks have taken a more cautious approach to adoption.\n\nTD Securities, the equity and securities trading arm of TD Bank, rolled out its TD AI Virtual Assistant on July 8, aimed toward its front office institutional sales, trading and research professionals to help them manage their workflow.\n\nTD Securities CIO Dan Bosman told VentureBeat that the virtual assistant’s primary goal is to help front-office equity sales and traders gain client insights and research.\n\n“The first version of this began as a pilot, which we then subsequently scaled,” Bosman said. “It’s really about accessing that equity research data that our analysts put out and bringing it to the hands of the sales team in a way that’s sales-friendly.”\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI.

So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders.\n\nBuilding TD AI\n\nBosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team. Fortunately, the bank has a platform called TD Invent, where employees can bring ideas and the innovation leadership team can evaluate projects responsibly.\n\n“Someone in our equity research sales desk came in and pretty much said, I’ve got this idea and brought it to TD Invent,” Bosman said. “What I’ve loved most about this is when you build something super magical, you don’t need to go out and sell or put a face on it. Folks come in and say to us, ‘we want this, we need this or we’ve got ideas,’ and it’s truly the best when we’re able to bring our investment in data, cloud and infrastructure together.”\n\nTD Security built the TD AI virtual assistant by leveraging OpenAI’s GPT models. Bosman said TD worked with its technology teams and the Canadian AI company Layer 6, which the bank acquired in 2018, as well as with other strategic partnerships. The assistant integrates with the bank’s cloud infrastructure, allowing it to access internal research documents and market data, such as 13F filings and historical equity data.\n\nBosman calls TDS AI a Knowledge Management System, a term that generally encompasses its ability to retrieve, through retrieval augmented generation (RAG) processes, aggregate and synthesize information into “concise context-aware summaries and insights” so its sales teams can answer client questions.\n\nTD AI virtual assistant also gives users access to TD Bank’s foundation model, TD AI Prism.\n\nThe model, launched in June, is in use throughout the entire bank and not just for TD Securities. During the launch, the bank said TD AI Prism will improve the predictive performance of TD Bank’s applications by processing 100 times more data, replacing its single-architecture models and ensuring customer data stays internal.\n\n“The development posed unique challenges, as gen AI was relatively new to the organization when the initiative began, requiring careful navigation of governance and controls,” Bosman said. “Despite this, the project successfully brought together diverse teams across the enterprise, fostering collaboration to deliver a cutting-edge solution.”\n\nHe added that one of the standout features is its text-to-SQL capability, which converts natural language prompts into SQL queries.\n\nTo train the assistant, Bosman said TD Securities developed optimizations to make the process easier.\n\n“With patent-pending optimizations in prompt engineering and dynamic few-shot examples retrieval, we successfully achieved the business’s desired performance through context learning,” Bosman said. “As a result, fine-tuning the underlying OpenAI model was not required for interacting with both unstructured as well as tabular datasets.”\n\nBanks slowly entering the agentic era\n\nTD Bank and TD Securities, of course, are not the only banks interested in expanding from assistants to AI agents.\n\nBNY told VentureBeat that it began offering multi-agent solutions to its sales teams to help answer customer questions, such as those related to foreign currency support. Wells Fargo also saw an increase in the usage of its internal AI assistant. For its auto sales customers, Capital One built an agent that helps them sell more cars.\n\nMany of these use cases emerged after months of pilot testing, as is the case in every other industry; however, financial institutions have the additional burden of strict customer data privacy and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nTD Securities’ Bosman noted that many employees, even on the bank’s business side, are increasingly familiar with tools like ChatGPT. The challenge with pilot testing assistants and agents lies less in teaching them about the tools, but in establishing best practices for using the assistants, integrating them into existing workflows, understanding their limitations and how humans can provide feedback to mitigate hallucinations.\n\nEventually, Bosman said the assistant would evolve into something even its users outside of the bank would want to use when interacting with TD Securities.\n\n“My vision is that we see AI as something that can add value to us, but also to external customers at the bank. Right now, it’s a massive opportunity for us around driving a stronger client experience and delivering a better colleague experience,” Bosman said.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"data\", \"layer\", \"teams\", \"taps\", \"insights\", \"equity\", \"realtime\", \"sales\", \"assistant\", \"openai\", \"ai\", \"banks\", \"trading\", \"securities\", \"bosman\", \"td\", \"bank\"]", "content_hash": "64d075a75336c3ead8dd9feb23ff656adc3d01b49f7a17a45748a5a633d88430", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:32:10.576171+00:00"}

The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.\n\nWhen developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.\n\n“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we’re trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nContinua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it’s needed.\n\nAs the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.\n\nIf a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.\n\nAt first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLMs to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune LLMs to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.\n\nFor instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.\n\n“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.\n\nUsers can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.\n\nUsers can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.\n\nWhile several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.\n\nErik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua’s group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who’s been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”\n\nAccording to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability. The agent is already assisting with event planning and trip booking, which he suggested they could charge for in the future.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The latest issue was distributed at the Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas last week.\n\nIn the article, the two hackers wrote that they were able to compromise a workstation containing a virtual machine and a virtual private server belonging to the hacker, whom they call “Kim.” The hackers claim Kim works for the North Korean government espionage group known as Kimsuky, also known as APT43 and Thallium. The hackers leaked the stolen data to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest.\n\nKimsuky is a prolific advanced persistent threat (APT) group widely believed to be working inside North Korea’s government, targeting journalists and government agencies in South Korea and elsewhere, and other targets that could be of interest for North Korea’s intelligence apparatus.\n\nAs is usual with North Korea, Kimsuky also conducts operations more akin to a cybercriminal group — for example, stealing and laundering cryptocurrencies to fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.\n\nThis hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group’s members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on.\n\n“It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky’ cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote.\n\nAn illustration of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which was included in the phrack article. Image Credits:Saber and cyb0rg/Phrack\n\nObviously, what Saber and cyb0rg did is technically a crime, although they will likely never be prosecuted for it, considering North Korea is sanctioned up to its eyeballs. The two hackers clearly believe Kimsuky members deserve to be exposed and embarrassed.\n\n“Kimsuky, you’re not a hacker. You are driven by financial greed, to enrich your leaders, and to fulfill their political agenda. You steal from others and favour your own. You value yourself above the others: You are morally perverted,” the two wrote in Phrack. “You hack for all the wrong reasons.”\n\nSaber and cyb0rg claim to have found evidence of Kimsuky compromising several South Korean government networks and companies, email addresses, and hacking tools used by the Kimsuky group, internal manuals, passwords, and more data.\n\nEmails sent to the addresses allegedly belonging to the hackers, which were listed in the research, went unanswered.\n\nThe hackers wrote that they were able to identify Kim as a North Korean government hacker, thanks to “artifacts and hints” that pointed in that direction, including files configurations and domains previously attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky.\n\nThe hackers also noted Kim’s “strict office hours, always connecting at around 09:00 and disconnecting by 17:00 Pyongyang time.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"hackers\", \"leaked\", \"korean\", \"operation\", \"major\", \"expose\", \"kimsuky\", \"hacker\", \"phrack\", \"wrote\", \"breach\", \"spying\", \"kim\", \"group\", \"north\"]", "content_hash": "c8de6d5753de0d3dbd53a7804dffb13e4b38495ce5600a1202aa00b61f80f38f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:35:49.194921+00:00"}

Appfigures defined the market segment in the same way, describing companion apps as those in which the user can interact with either premade or user-generated synthetic characters meant to embody an actual personality.\n\nPopular apps in this space include Replika, Character.AI, PolyBuzz, Chai, and others.\n\nAs of July 2025, AI companion apps across the Apple App Store and Google Play have been downloaded 220 million times globally.

In July, xAI’s Grok launched AI companions, including an anime girl and guy, as well as a snarky 3D fox.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT’s recent upgrade to GPT-5 brought to light the fact that many of its users felt a kinship with the older model, as they mourned the loss of their AI companion, whom they had come to depend upon.\n\nTo address these and other concerns about GPT-5’s performance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman brought back the 4o model for the time being.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nGoogle last year tapped into the market, too, when it hired away Character.ai’s founder, Noam Shazeer. The Character.ai app lives on and still has tens of millions of monthly active users.\n\nAccording to Appfigures’ data, the most popular AI companion apps are those used by people looking for an AI girlfriend. Of the active apps on the market today, 17% have an app name that includes the word “girlfriend,” compared with 4% that say “boyfriend” or “fantasy.” Terms like anime, soulmate, and lover, among others, are less frequently mentioned.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nThe firm notes there were likely a number of other AI companion apps that launched on the app stores since 2022, but were later removed after failing to gain traction in terms of revenue or downloads.

Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches.\n\nThe package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.\n\nThe move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration’s list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s challenges in kind.\n\nAnthropic’s escalation — a response to OpenAI’s attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company’s foothold in federal AI usage.\n\n“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we’re helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”\n\nAnthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government.

Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages.\n\nAnthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government’s highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data.\n\nAnthropic’s multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers.\n\nOpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of “one size fits all” AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eliminate the need for users to navigate its model picker — a long, complicated menu of AI options that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly said he hates.\n\nBut it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.\n\nAltman said in a post on X Tuesday that the company introduced new “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5’s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT:\n\n\n\nYou can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5.

GPT-4o is now in the model picker by default, while other AI models can be added from ChatGPT’s settings.\n\n“We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman wrote in the post on X. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”\n\nChatGPT’s model picker now features several options (Credit: openai/maxwell zeff)\n\nChatGPT’s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5’s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5’s rollout has been rougher than expected.\n\nThe deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a backlash among users who had grown attached to the AI models’ responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn’t as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an AMA session on Reddit. However, it seems that GPT-5’s router may still not be satisfying for all users.\n\n“We’re not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,” wrote OpenAI’s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a post on X Tuesday.\n\nRouting prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user’s preferences, as well as the specific question they’re asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second — that way, if a prompt goes to a fast responding AI model, the response can still be fast.\n\nMore broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another.\n\nHuman attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn’t well understood.

The approval comes more than two years after the Noida-based fintech was initially denied the license in November 2022 due to noncompliance with India’s rules on receiving investments from countries that share a land border.\n\nWithout the license, Paytm was barred from onboarding new online merchants. At the time, the company said the restriction had “no material impact” on its business or revenues. However, at its annual general meeting last September, One97 Communications founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma stated his intention to reapply for the payment aggregator license.\n\nThe approval also comes over a year after the RBI banned Paytm Payments Bank from accepting fresh deposits and enabling credit transactions. Paytm weathered that impact by quickly shifting gears and partnering with Axis, HDFC, State Bank of India, and Yes Bank to make them serve as payment system providers for its consumers and merchants involved in online transactions and autopay mandates.\n\nWith the new license, Paytm can operate as a service provider for online merchants, enabling them to accept a range of payment methods, including cards, net banking, and the Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The approval also lifts the online merchant onboarding restrictions imposed by the central bank in 2022.\n\nThe approval comes just a week after China’s Ant Group exited Paytm by selling its remaining 5.8% direct stake in One97 Communications for $454 million through block deals. This follows an earlier exit in 2023, when Ant Financial sold a 10.3% stake — worth $628 million — to Sharma in a no-cash deal.\n\nPaytm is required to undertake a “system audit,” including a cybersecurity review, and submit its report to the Reserve Bank of India within six months. If it fails to do so, the approval will lapse, per the RBI letter enclosed with the company’s stock exchange filing. The license is also limited to online payment services and does not extend beyond that scope.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nThe latest development will help Paytm control most of its value chain, from its offline sound boxes to the online payment gateway, and reduce its reliance on other bank partners, fintech investor Osborne Saldanha told TechCrunch.\n\nPaytm is currently the third most-used UPI payments platform, behind Walmart-owned PhonePe and Google Pay. The fintech accounted for 6.9% of the total 18.4 billion UPI transactions in June and 5.6% of the transaction value, per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In total, Paytm processed 1.27 billion UPI transactions worth ₹1.34 trillion (approximately $15 billion).\n\nAlthough Paytm trails PhonePe and Google Pay in the UPI market — with the duo handling over 82% of all UPI transactions in June — the company offers a broad suite of businesses and services to attract both consumers and merchants. These include offline merchant payment solutions with integrated hardware, software, and service layers, as well as a growing credit and lending business.\n\nPaytm reported (PDF) net income of ₹1.23 billion (approximately $14 million) for the first quarter of its financial year 2026, ending in June — a turnaround from a loss during the same period last year. The results beat expectations, as analysts had projected a loss of ₹1.27 billion (approximately $14.5 million). Revenue rose 28% year-over-year to $224 million, while the company’s contribution margin improved to 60%, up from 50% a year ago.\n\nIn addition to its recent financial growth, Paytm’s shares have risen 13.25% year-to-date in 2025, signaling that the company is beginning to regain market confidence after more than a year of regulatory setbacks. The stock closed at ₹1,118.50 (approximately $13) on Wednesday, just before the regulatory approval was announced.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nIt used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable Watch SE (now in its second generation) and, in 2022, the rugged Apple Watch Ultra (also now in its second generation). Suddenly, there are lots of options.\n\nNow that the Series 10 has been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS, watchOS 11, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of watchOS 26, which is slated to arrive in the fall.\n\nWhat we’re looking for How we test Apple Watches Collapse Apple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life. Who is it for? Collapse We’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs. Price Collapse Should you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying refurbished, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year. Feature set Collapse Do you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you? LTE or GPS Collapse Some scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, others you can get away with just having GPS.\n\nBuying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without sacrificing blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024, no longer have this feature. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)\n\nWhat about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it’s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.\n\nSo much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don’t worry. I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to basically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market — and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.\n\nShould you get an Apple Watch?\n\nThe Apple Watch Ultra was introduced in 2022 as the new rugged kid on the block. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market.\n\nBy their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist.\n\nThe SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.\n\nPolished titanium replaces stainless steel with the new Series 10. It’s quite fetching. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nAs for straps, we recommend the nylon sport loop, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.\n\nThe Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the Trail Loop, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.\n\nAnd while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our fitness tracker buying guide.\n\nApple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?\n\nThe latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you’re upgrading from an older model, you’ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There’s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\nWe recommend the second-gen Apple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you’re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.\n\nThe Series 10 focuses on making the watch more readable and comfortable to wear. photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe Series 10 is Apple’s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it’s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm, but you can often find both models on sale. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.\n\nThe second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original’s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch For Your Kids. The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, an EKG sensor, temperature sensors, and a SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm, but you can regularly find them for cheaper. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier’s fees.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, if you’re young and healthy, you’re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will not be able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.\n\nThe main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection — and if your doctor’s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the biggest risk factors for AFib are advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn’t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra cash — so long as the lack of an always-on display isn’t a deal-breaker.\n\nYou can’t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right.\n\nThere are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you’ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.\n\nThe Ultra 2 currently sits atop the lineup as Apple’s premium smartwatch. It’s visually distinct from both the Series and SE — and at 49mm, it’s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It’s also got the Action button, which can be programmed for various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.\n\nAt $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.\n\nWhat about blood oxygen? As of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore subject to an import ban. This doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer. That said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on any wearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They cannot and should not replace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from Garmin, the Fitbit Charge 6, the Withings ScanWatch 2, or the Oura Ring.\n\nIf battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who wants to be at that level.\n\nYou’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct charging accessories.\n\nIf you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.\n\nThe best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget\n\nThe latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display). You’re getting the same processor as the Series 8 and original Ultra, plus Crash Detection.\n\nWhile the second-gen SE is an excellent watch, it’s not always the right choice. It’s meant to be a gateway watch, so it’s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don’t want to pony up for the Series 10, there’s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.\n\nBuying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It’s also a good way to save money if you’re just not excited by the Series 10’s features but want more than what the SE offers.\n\nOpting for a Series 9 now means you may be able to score stainless steel for a discounted price. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nThe second-gen SE is excellent for folks on a budget or those who want a smaller case size.

However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you’re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough, Verge Deals). Apple also sells its own refurbished models, which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a “like new” condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won’t pay less than a new SE. Sites like Back Market will also allow you to sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty.\n\nIf you’re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8, as they offer a larger screen for improved readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that’s the price of a base model Watch SE. With that said, if you’re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 5 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can’t run the latest software and even struggle to update the newest software they do support.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for kids\n\nIf you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.\n\nSince you’re buying for children, you’ll likely want to use Apple Watch For Your Kids — formerly known as Family Setup — as it will give you greater parental controls. However, there are technical specifications that you’ll need to match in order to use it. You’ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple’s support page also states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE to use it.\n\nThe second-gen SE is a good option to give to your kids. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIf you opt for the family route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.\n\nThe best Apple Watch for older relatives\n\nThis can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10.\n\nFor starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You’ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.\n\nYou can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one’s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear.\n\nThe larger screen size but lighter weight of the Series 10 may benefit older relatives. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIf your older relative has an iPhone and you’re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don’t recommend using Apple’s family setup. That’s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn’t have an iPhone, however, it’s a fine option. You’ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection.\n\nWhat’s coming next\n\nIn previous years, Apple has held an event in early September to show off its forthcoming product lineup. While the latest iPhones usually hog the spotlight, the fall event remains a prime time for the company to trot out the newest Apple Watch models, many of which launch shortly thereafter alongside Apple’s latest OS updates.\n\nSo, what can we expect this year? The Apple Watch Series 11 seems like a sure bet, and there have been murmurs regarding an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and a third-gen Apple Watch SE. Recently uncovered evidence in the fifth iOS 26 developer beta lends some credence to this report, suggesting the Ultra 3 could have a display resolution of 422 x 514, which is slightly bigger than the 410 x 502 resolution on the Ultra 2. The rumor mill has been pretty quiet outside of that, but if previous events are anything to go by, we can expect Apple’s refreshed lineup to offer updated design elements, better battery life, and new health features.\n\nUpdate, August 13th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of Apple’s heavily rumored iPhone event.

In a series of X posts on Monday night, Musk suggested that Apple was “playing politics” by not placing either X or xAI’s Grok chatbot in the App Store’s list of recommended iOS apps, and that he had no choice but to file a lawsuit.\n\n“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk said. “Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?,” the xAI CEO asked Apple in another post, which is now pinned to his profile.\n\nMusk provided no evidence for his claims, and it’s unclear if he has made good on his threats and filed the lawsuit yet.\n\nAn Apple statement reported by Bloomberg and attributed to an unnamed spokesperson says the App Store is “designed to be fair and free of bias… we feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.” The Verge has also reached out to xAI and OpenAI for comment.\n\nAt the time of writing, ChatGPT is listed as Apple’s top free iPhone app in the US, with Grok ranked as the sixth. China’s DeepSeek AI briefly managed to take the top App Store position from ChatGPT in January, however, disproving Musk’s claim that it would be impossible for other AI apps to do so.\n\nAccusations of meddling from Musk are ironic, given allegations about alterations made to X after he acquired the company in 2022, then known as Twitter. A research study in 2024 suggested that X’s algorithm was manipulated to boost posts from Musk’s account. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk’s posts by sharing a Platformer report from 2023 that similarly found Musk had a system built to promote his X posts to the entire platform’s userbase. In June, the “maximally truth-seeking” Grok chatbot was also found to be consulting Musk’s opinion before providing answers to controversial questions around topics like Israel and Palestine, US immigration, and abortion.\n\nThis isn’t the first time that Musk has beefed with Apple and OpenAI. Musk was an early founder at OpenAI, and previously targeted the AI startup via lawsuits and a unanimously rejected $97.4 billion buyout offer after taking issue with its pivot to being a profit-driven business. Following OpenAI’s partnership with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs last year, Musk threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies if OpenAI’s tech was fused with Apple’s OS.\n\nUpdate, August 12th: Added statement from Apple given to Bloomberg.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"apple\", \"posts\", \"musk\", \"apps\", \"rankings\", \"openai\", \"suing\", \"ai\", \"rigging\", \"hes\", \"grok\", \"elon\", \"x\", \"store\", \"app\"]", "content_hash": "e6f4f0bb82e545c12716514a710fd022741788ba98445c6541638d1aee19222c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:35:57.915913+00:00"}

Her company's chips underpin the artificial intelligence that’s changing the world at breakneck speeds. To hear Su and literally everyone else in semiconductors talk about it, the US is in an AI race with China—and the rules keep changing. The Trump administration has once again shifted its stance on what kind of chips can and can’t be shipped to China, with the latest decree being that the US will take a 15 percent cut of AMD and Nvidia chip sales to China. Meanwhile, on the home front, Su has claimed that AMD’s newest AI chips can outperform Nvidia’s—part of her strategy to keep eroding Nvidia’s dominance in the market.\n\nSo, yeah: Be ready to keep up.\n\nUnder Lisa Su, the stalwart American semiconductor company has reasserted itself as a force in the age of AI. “Reasserted” doesn’t do it justice: Su took a struggling AMD and executed a 10-year turnaround that has been, as one economist put it, nothing short of remarkable. Since 2014, when Su took over as CEO, AMD’s market cap has risen from around $2 billion to nearly $300 billion.\n\nAside from her well-known bona fides, Su herself—what drives her, what inspires her, what irritates her, where her politics lie—is less known. This is what I was hoping to learn when I visited AMD’s offices and labs in the hills of Austin, Texas, on a day in late June when the wind seemed to do little more than push heat around.\n\nThe Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.\n\nOur conversation kicked off with China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of AMD’s business. She betrayed no anxiety. Su now travels frequently to Washington, DC, to grease the wheels. “We’ve come to realize that export controls are a bit of a fact of life,” she told me, “just given how critical the chips that we make are.” In other words, it’s precisely because AMD’s chips are so darn important—to national security, to national economies—that they’re now at the heart of modern statecraft.\n\nAnother thing I learned about Su: She plays the long game. Politics is a cakewalk compared to what she’s managed to pull off professionally.\n\nSu was born in Taiwan in 1969 and raised in Queens, New York. Her father worked for the city as a statistician; her mother was an accountant who became an entrepreneur in her mid-forties. Su earned a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from MIT, then went on to stints at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor, where she served in executive roles. After joining AMD in 2012, she quickly rose to COO. As Su tells it, six months in, the chairman of the board called her and said, “It’s time, Lisa.” Su’s response: “Really? That seems kinda quick.”\n\nAs CEO, Su smartly steered AMD toward the high-performance computing market. She embraced chiplets, a modular approach to building chips that has paid off enormously. She impressed the industry by launching the world’s first 7-nanometer data center GPUs. More recently, she doubled AMD’s data center revenue in two years. And she has struck deals with juggernauts like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and a couple of Elon Musk’s companies. During a keynote speech at AMD’s annual event this June, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman trotted onto the stage to hug it out with Su.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"took\", \"thats\", \"amdand\", \"amd\", \"ai\", \"amds\", \"chips\", \"ceo\", \"su\", \"runs\", \"lisa\", \"nvidias\", \"blood\", \"china\"]", "content_hash": "5cded454b491759e5b55e8be644888408ecbaa4a734162a0efe6246ebe236786", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:03.997340+00:00"}

They believe that white people and Western culture are facing extinction due to an influx of immigrants and minorities, and according to the group’s founder, access to the community is open only to people of white European ancestry who share common views on topics such as segregation, abortion, and gender identity.\n\nVideo footage shared by the group on its social media accounts show a bucolic setting with animals and children running around their 160-acre site, while members of the community build timber-frame homes, churches, and other facilities. A “few dozen” people are already living there full time, says Eric Orwoll, the group’s president.\n\nThough the organization claims that Return to the Land is nothing more than a peaceful settlement of like-minded people, the online histories of the group’s leaders tell a different story. Members have espoused virulently racist and antisemitic views and repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. One of the leaders says he is currently under criminal investigation in Ecuador. Orwoll himself has spoken about the coming of a second Hitler and praised KKK leader David Duke. He is also closely aligned to an international network of far-right influencers, extremists, and white supremacists, including Thomas Sewell, a neo-Nazi living in Australia who was the founder of a group that influenced the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter.\n\nDespite this, the Return to the Land community has been lauded by far-right influencers and has already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.\n\nReturn to the Land, which was first reported on by The Forward and Sky News, is actively scouting for other locations to create a network of similar communities across the country, with a development in Missouri apparently in the works. Inspired in part by the Silicon Valley-based concept of the “network state” and by a white separatist community in South Africa known as Orania, the group promotes itself on its website as a community designed to “promote strong families with common ancestry, and raise the next generation in an environment that reflects our traditional values.”\n\n“They use a lot of innocuous language,” Morgan Moon, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, tells WIRED. “Instead of saying they want to make a white ethnic community, they say they want to make a strong community of common ancestry. But at the same time, when we see their promotional videos and propaganda, what we see is that when they're depicting the failing modern society, they use imagery consisting of minority groups or the LGBT+ community. When they're showing the idealized parallel society that they're attempting to create with Return to the Land, they tend to only use white Aryan imagery.”\n\nOrwoll has spent years building up an audience of like-minded followers on social media, primarily on YouTube, where he speaks about Western culture and philosophy.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"return\", \"inside\", \"land\", \"common\", \"ancestry\", \"groups\", \"network\", \"white\", \"whites\", \"theyre\", \"community\", \"arkansas\", \"group\"]", "content_hash": "2364743eb2972f5cc37ef998d3fa291610530899d97576586430ea073a3d0802", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:04.693695+00:00"}

The proceeds will be used to build a $1.5 billion WLFI treasury, equating to roughly 7.5 percent of the coin’s total supply.\n\nEric Trump will join the ALT5 board of directors, which will be chaired by fellow World Liberty Financial cofounder Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, who was appointed special envoy to the Middle East by US president Donald Trump.\n\nALT5 is marketed as a crypto payments company. But in practice, the deal will turn the stock into a sort of proxy for the WLFI coin, allowing investors to bet on the asset without the hassle and risk that comes with holding a crypto coin themselves.\n\n“One small step for mankind, one giant leap for WLFI,” wrote World Liberty Financial in an X post.\n\nHowever, the arrangement has drawn criticism from those who regard it as an example of self-serving Wall Street gymnastics that can lead to losses among unsophisticated investors, even if it doesn’t break any official rules.\n\n“This is the classic Wall Street experience—meaning Wall Street gains your money, and you gain experience,\" claims Michael Green, chief strategist at asset management firm Simplify. “The funding from the World Liberty Financial investment is being used to buy the product of World Liberty Financial: the token.

Its ubiquity was clearly not lost on the Department of Homeland Security’s communications team. Late last month, DHS published a video to its social accounts that incorporated the \"Nothing Beats a Jet2 Holiday\" tune alongside footage of ICE detainees in handcuffs boarding a deportation plane. The post was captioned: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”\n\nTo many of the administration’s supporters, who responded to the Jet2 holiday post with crying-laughing emojis and American flags, the video was hilarious. One commenter wrote, “I thought this was a meme account at first!”\n\nIn recent months, official government social media accounts—primarily for the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the White House—have resembled parodies of themselves. But experts say it’s intentional: The memes these accounts share are core to the Trump administration’s propaganda strategy. Through them, with attempts at Gen Z humor as the gateway, the administration reinforces an “us vs. them” mindset. Along with normalizing mass deportation, they also tap into Christian nationalist narratives and reach young men via callous jokes that have been recycled through the far-right online ecosystem.\n\nA post on June 28 featured four alligators wearing ICE hats, intended to advertise the detention facility in Florida’s Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” On July 2, DHS shared a video of a border patrol agent looking through a scope, trained on blurry night-vision images of purported migrants attempting to cross the border. The video was published with the popular TikTok song “Somebody’s Watching Me” by Chico Rose x 71 Digits. The caption warns: “You’re not wrong.” A video shared on July 24 showed footage of ICE detainees boarding a deportation flight, with the caption “Boarding now: Criminal illegal aliens. Next stop: Literally anywhere but here.” The post was accompanied by Frank Sinatra’s breezy classic “Come Fly With Me.” Libs of TikTok, a far-right and anti-LGBTQ social account with millions of followers, reposted that video, along with three crying-laughing emojis.\n\nAnd last week, DHS published an ICE recruitment poster that used an old magazine ad for the 1982 “King of Clubs,” a Ford Club Wagon vehicle, along with the text “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” The move from viral sensation to DHS meme is particularly clear here: The image was originally shared a week earlier by O.W. Root, a style columnist for The Blaze. A small account with 364 followers quote-tweeted the post, with the caption “imagine monitoring the situation with your boys here.” That post went viral. Days later, the image, along with a similar caption, appeared on DHS’s social accounts.\n\nThe fact that the government is now integrating the casual cruelty of the highly online far-right into its public messaging shows the degree to which it’s escaped containment. It’s also indicative of the demographic the administration is attempting to reach. The Trump administration is looking to hire 14,050 ICE officers over the next three years to bolster deportation operations. Although the agency just removed age limits from prospective applicants, it now appears they’re trying to use humor to make ICE seem like some sort of fun fraternity.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"deportation\", \"ice\", \"jet2\", \"caption\", \"trump\", \"turn\", \"big\", \"post\", \"mass\", \"administration\", \"social\", \"viral\", \"memes\", \"dhs\", \"video\", \"using\", \"joke\"]", "content_hash": "80b005c602f454751415c91572a40cc4216677a612275163e7224de674b984de", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:06.078346+00:00"}

It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.”\n\n“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.\n\nOther threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.\n\nAltman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”\n\nErrors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.\n\nGot a Tip? Are you a current or former OpenAI employee who wants to talk about what's happening?

Using a nonwork phone or computer, contact the reporter securely on Signal at wak.01.\n\nThe backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.\n\nIn March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.\n\n“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more “business” and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”\n\nAltman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.\n\n“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn’t describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"model\", \"chatgpt\", \"openai\", \"gpt5\", \"revolt\", \"models\", \"company\", \"scrambles\", \"users\", \"x\", \"wrote\", \"things\", \"update\"]", "content_hash": "b1051e9f041fed6c80f07c574ce1d6e1ee8cdc1f19685022ca30a09ab28669cd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:06.768512+00:00"}

Now It’s Selling Stories", "authors": "[\"Kylie Robison\", \"Lauren Goode\", \"Reece Rogers\", \"Will Knight\", \"Louise Matsakis\"]", "published": "2025-08-12T15:00:00+00:00", "text": "After school, Karandeep Anand often finds his 6-year-old daughter deep in conversation with an AI chatbot as she eats snacks at their kitchen counter. She’s too young to type—let alone have her own account on Character.AI—but that hasn’t stopped her from nabbing his phone to have voice conversations with a Sherlock Holmes bot, which she uses to build her own mystery stories.\n\nCharacter.AI is an AI companion startup (though Anand likes to say it's an AI role-play startup, which we’ll get into later). He took over as the CEO in June in the midst of a potentially devastating lawsuit for its parent company and looming questions about child safety. When I ask if he’s concerned about his daughter connecting with an AI chatbot rather than a real human, he’s quick to say no.\n\n“It is very rarely, in any of these scenarios, a true replacement for any human,” Anand told me during a video call late last week. ”It's very clearly noted in the app that, hey, this is a role-play and an entertainment, so you will never start going deep into that conversation, assuming that it is your actual companion.”\n\nIt's a delicate moment for Character.AI.\n\nLast August, Google swooped in with a roughly $2.7 billion deal to license Character.AI’s technology. As part of the agreement, Character.AI’s two cofounders left for Google’s AI division.\n\nAnand, who previously worked as the VP of business products at Meta, was tasked with picking up the pieces—which he did in part by leaving behind the founding mission of delivering personalized superintelligence to focus on AI entertainment.\n\n“What we gave up was this aspiration that the founders had of building AGI models—we are no longer doing that. That is the hundreds of billions of dollars investment fight, which Big Tech is fighting,” Anand says. “What we got in return was clarity and focus, being able to singularly pursue the AI entertainment vision.”\n\nAs part of this change in strategy, Character.AI is no longer trying to build its own frontier models. “The last six months, we've done a lot of work to get off of our proprietary models on text and start using open source models,” Anand says. The company has tested a few: Meta’s Llama, Alibaba’s Qwen, and DeepSeek. “The open source models are beating any proprietary model hands down,” Anand claims.\n\nRunning an AI startup without billions of dollars in revenue can be a brutal equation, and Character.AI is still figuring out how to make the math work. The company told me it's generating revenue at a run rate of more than $30 million and is on track to reach $50 million in revenue by the end of the year. When I asked Anand how many users pay for the $10 monthly subscription, he didn’t give a number but noted “monetization wasn't a focus till four or five months ago.”\n\n“Since I've been on board, it's very clear we do need to monetize. And we've had, I think, almost 250 percent subscriber growth in the last six months. So the paid user base is growing quite, quite well,” Anand says. Character.AI recently introduced advertisements, including reward ads (where users can choose to watch an ad to get access to on-platform incentives), to help monetize in countries where subscriptions aren’t feasible, he tells me.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"selling\", \"work\", \"startup\", \"ai\", \"revenue\", \"company\", \"agi\", \"anand\", \"months\", \"models\", \"characterai\", \"gave\", \"focus\"]", "content_hash": "18bca29dd59da5867d900ac6d23164515e6453d7299bd709dd9af7b7100d56a7", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:07.458316+00:00"}

The announcement marks the end of a technology that served as the primary gateway to the web for millions of users throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nAOL confirmed the shutdown date in a help message to customers: \"AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. This service will no longer be available in AOL plans.\"\n\nAlong with the dial-up service, AOL announced it will retire its AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser on the same date. The dialer software managed the connection process between computers and AOL's network, while Shield was a web browser optimized for slower connections and older operating systems.\n\nAOL's dial-up service launched as \"America Online\" in 1991 as a closed commercial online service, with dial-up roots extending back to Quantum Link for Commodore computers in 1985. However, AOL didn't provide actual internet access yet: The ability to browse the web, access newsgroups, or use services like gopher launched in 1994. Before then, AOL users could only access content hosted on AOL's own servers.\n\nWhen AOL finally opened its gates to the internet in 1994, websites were measured in kilobytes, images were small and compressed, and video was essentially impossible. The AOL service grew alongside the web itself, peaking at over 25 million subscribers in the early 2000s before broadband adoption accelerated its decline.\n\nAccording to 2022 US Census data, approximately 175,000 American households still connect to the internet through dial-up services. These users typically live in rural areas where broadband infrastructure doesn't exist or remains prohibitively expensive to install.\n\nFor these users, the alternatives are limited. Satellite internet now serves between 2 million and 3 million US subscribers split between various services, offering speeds far exceeding dial-up but often with data caps and higher latency. Traditional broadband through DSL, cable, or fiber-optic connections serves the vast majority of US internet users but requires infrastructure investments that don't always make economic sense in sparsely populated areas.\n\nThe persistence of dial-up highlights the ongoing digital divide in the United States. While urban users enjoy gigabit fiber connections, some rural residents still rely on the same technology that powered the internet of 1995. Even basic tasks like loading a modern webpage—designed with the assumption of broadband speeds—can take minutes over a dial-up connection, or sometimes it doesn't work at all.\n\nThe gap between dial-up and modern internet connections is staggering. A typical dial-up connection delivered 0.056 megabits per second, while today's average fiber connection provides 500 Mbps—nearly 9,000 times faster. To put this in perspective, downloading a single high-resolution photo that loads instantly on broadband would take several minutes on dial-up. A movie that streams in real time on Netflix would require days of downloading. But for millions of Americans who lived through the dial-up era, these statistics tell only part of the story.\n\nThe Sound of the Early Internet\n\nFor those who came online before broadband, dial-up meant a specific ritual: clicking the dial button, hearing your modem dial a local access number, then listening to the distinctive handshake sequence—a cacophony of static, beeps, and hissing that indicated your computer was negotiating a connection with AOL's servers. Once connected, users paid by the hour or through monthly plans that offered limited hours of access.\n\nThe technology worked by converting digital data into audio signals that traveled over standard telephone lines, originally designed in the 19th century for voice calls. This meant users couldn't receive phone calls while online, leading to countless family disputes over internet time. The fastest consumer modems topped out at 56 kilobits per second under ideal conditions.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"aol\", \"online\", \"services\", \"connection\", \"shut\", \"service\", \"access\", \"users\", \"broadband\", \"internet\", \"web\", \"dialup\"]", "content_hash": "38bdb345321b5cddb5e6cf7c4696b4254d2272829ae6b9f7ba8fffa001d1ecac", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:08.816121+00:00"}

You’re in good company, as many of the WIRED Reviews team are also side sleepers. So are most Americans. The numbers vary across studies and depend on how rigidly you define “side sleeper,” but between half and three-quarters of people sleep on their side for at least part of the night.\n\nIf you're a side sleeper, you know how crucial it is that your bed keeps your back aligned while the hips and shoulders get some cushioning. Otherwise, it's a disaster. Without enough lumbar support, your middle is sinking in way farther than the rest of your body. Meanwhile, the hips and shoulders get that much more strain placed on them, especially if the bed is not forthcoming with pressure relief. It doesn't paint a cozy picture, which is why we side sleepers want something that accomplishes the lumbar support, pressure relief, and comfortability trifecta.\n\nMany of our testers side-sleep and can speak to the necessity of these mattress performance factors firsthand, including Reviews team director Martin Cizmar and sleep writer Julia Forbes, a certified sleep science coach. It's never so simple as just lying down on a bed and saying “Eureka!” That's why we spend at least a week with each bed to monitor our daily sleep and feelings toward each one.

Just one month after the premiere of the new live-action series Ironheart (see below) comes this new animated anthology series that delves even further into the Wakanda mythology. Two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Coogler—the man behind both Black Panther movies—developed this four-episode prequel in which the Hatut Zaraze, aka Wakanda’s “War Dogs,” embark on adventure-filled missions to retrieve long-lost Vibranium artifacts.\n\nIronheart\n\nRyan Coogler is responsible for what is arguably the best movie in the MCU (2018’s Black Panther), and now he’s executive producing one of its most interesting small-screen endeavors. Playwright Chinaka Hodge created this series, which picks up right after the events featured in 2022’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It stars Dominique Thorne, who reprises her role as Riri Williams, aka Ironheart, a brilliant MIT student who has successfully managed to create a Tony Stark–like suit of armor. It gives her the kind of invincibility that changes her outlook on the world—and leads her down a pothole-filled path that could see her heroic character go the way of the antihero in a way that critics have described as being similar to The Sopranos’ Tony Soprano and Breaking Bad’s Walter White.\n\nUnderdogs\n\nRyan Reynolds brings his penchant for turning genres on their heads to National Geographic with a brand-new kind of nature special. The Deadpool star narrates and serves as executive producer on this fun docuseries which puts the spotlight on the “underdogs” of the animal kingdom—those creatures and critters who don’t always warrant the same amount of respect as the kings and queens they share real estate with. Or, as Reynolds calls them, the “super zeroes.”\n\nDoctor Who\n\nSpring 2024 marked the beginning of a new era for Doctor Who fans when Ncuti Gatwa was officially handed the sonic screwdriver to take the legendary sci-fi series in new directions as the Fifteenth Doctor. He did it all over again with a second season, which aired a game-changing finale on May 31 that has viewers wondering where the Doctor will be headed next. Russell T. Davies is also back to oversee all the time-traveling shenanigans as the latest incarnation of the Time Lord journeys through space and time with companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), and new addition Belinda Chandra (Varada Sethu). While the series will keep its standing as a BBC staple in the UK and Ireland, American audiences will need to head to Disney+ to experience it all.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Underworld\n\nThere are two types of people in this world: those who think there are more Star Wars movies and TV shows that one person needs and those who are counting down the days until The Mandalorian & Grogu arrives in theaters next year. If you’re part of that latter group, you’re in good company—and have plenty of series to choose from, including this six-part anthology that follows 2022’s Tales of the Jedi and last year’s Tales of the Empire (see below). In true Star Wars style, it tells the story of two villains, former assassin/bounty hunter Asajj Ventress and outlaw Cad Bane, who form an unlikely alliance in an attempt to build new lives for themselves, until Bane catches up with an old colleague, who has switched sides to become a law-abiding marshal. Dark versus light battle it out once more.\n\nAndor\n\nAndor, which just scored 14 Emmy nominations, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, is something of a miracle. Created by Tony Gilroy, the two-time Oscar nominee behind Michael Clayton and a writer on the Bourne movies, it’s the origin story of one of Rogue One's most beloved characters, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). Set in the early years of the Rebellion, it charts Andor’s path to becoming one of the most integral of the Rebels. With a supporting cast that includes Fiona Shaw and Stellan Skarsgård, it features a fantastic score from Nicholas Britell (Moonlight, Succession). After spending so much time with Mandalorians and Jedis, it’s a welcome reprieve and perhaps the closest thing to prestige TV the Star Wars universe has released.\n\nOklahoma City Bombing: One Day in America\n\nThirty years after the Oklahoma City Bombing, Nat Geo takes a look back at the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The three-part docuseries features rarely seen archival footage and interviews with survivors who are sharing their harrowing stories for the first time. While it’s undoubtedly a tragic story, the series also recounts the inspiring way in which it united Americans.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nDaredevil fans were devastated when the original Netflix series was canceled in 2018, but Charlie Cox never strayed far from his title role for too long. He popped up as Matt Murdock/Daredevil in MCU movies (Spider-Man: No Way Home) and TV shows (She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Echo, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man), all the while biding his time until his eponymous series came back. Seven years and one massive overhaul later, fans seem to think it was worth the wait. Born Again sees Cox facing off against crime lord turned mayoral candidate Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) once more. There’s also a darkness to the series that seems to borrow a page from Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight playbook, though it’s not as elegant in its execution. Still, it’s a solid crime drama that sets itself apart from many other MCU series thanks to its more mature tone. Whether you were into the Netflix series or not, it might be time to dig in.\n\nWin or Lose\n\nWill Forte, Rhea Seehorn, Ian Chen, Melissa Villaseñor, and Izaac Wang are among the dozens of actors and comedians who lend their voices to Pixar’s very first original animated series. Over the course of eight episodes, this charming series plays out the same events that occur in the week leading up to a middle school softball team’s championship game from the perspective of various characters, including a wise bead of sweat known as Sweaty (and voiced by comedian Jo Firestone). If the title sounds familiar to you, it might be because the series created some controversy back in December when it was revealed that a transgender character’s storyline had been cut from the series. Disney’s reasoning? “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\n\nFour years after it was first announced, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man arrived early this year. The animated series dares to imagine what kind of chaos might have ensued if Peter Parker (Hudson Thames) had been mentored by baddie Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Colman Domingo) instead of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Oh, the horror (and fun)! A second season has already been confirmed, though likely won’t premiere until 2026.\n\nGoosebumps: The Vanishing\n\nFor more than 30 years, R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps books have fed the nightmares of young readers—much to their delight (well, usually). Now Disney is inspiring a whole new generation of horror lovers with this fun series, which follows the lives of a group of high schoolers who begin to unravel the terrifying truth about a decades-old murder—and the roles their nearest and dearest might have played in it—in their otherwise picture-perfect hometown. The always-affable Justin Long starred as a teacher who may or may not be possessed in season 1 of this anthology series. Its second, and final, season brought an extended title (Goosebumps: The Vanishing), a new cast (including Friends star David Schwimmer), and a whole new set of nightmares.\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\n\nDo you love Star Wars but wish it had more Warriors/The Wizard of Oz/The Brave Little Toaster energy? Lucasfilm has heard your cries and is here to oblige. For Skeleton Crew, they assembled a gang of four youths who get lost in the Star Wars universe and try to find their way home with the help of Jude Law, who plays an “enigmatic scoundrel\" named Jod. OK, so Star Wars probably already has enough of those, but who cares? The real treasure is the friends you'll make along the way.\n\nLuther\n\nAdd DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) to the long list of “conflicted cops who mean well.” It's a character archetype that TV viewers have seen dozens of times before, but few actors take it to the level that Elba does. Forget bending the rules—Luther dismantles them and has no regrets. Planting evidence? Killing a criminal? Buddying up to a homicidal sociopath who can take the real “bad guys” out on your behalf? Luther has seen and done it all in the name of justice. Somehow it’s hard not to root for him at every turn.\n\nLego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy\n\nSig Greebling (Stranger Things’ Gaten Matarazzo) discovers an ancient relic that alters the history of the universe—turning Jar Jar Binks into a lightsaber-wielding Sith and Luke Skywalker into Just Some Guy. With the help of a wise old Jedi, Sig must do what he can to piece things back together. Sure, the plotline has all the makings of a typical Star Wars story, but with Mark Hamill and Ahmed Best lending their voices to the minifig versions of the characters that made them famous, it also does so in a way that pokes just the right amount of fun at the canon.\n\nAgatha All Along\n\nAfter Kathryn Hahn became the (not-so-surprising) breakout star of 2021’s WandaVision miniseries (more on that below), MCU fans were thrilled—but, again, not surprised—when she nabbed her own series with Agatha All Along. The long-awaited spinoff takes place three years after the events of WandaVision, with witch Agatha (now stripped of all her magical powers) enlisting a teenager (Joe Locke) and a new coven to help her regain her status as HWIC. Aubrey Plaza, Patti LuPone, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp round out the stellar cast.\n\nBluey\n\nYes, Bluey is technically a children’s show. But everyone is welcome to enjoy this animated series from Australia, which centers around an endlessly curious blue heeler pup named Bluey and her family (mom, dad, and little sister). The show’s brevity—each episode clocks in at around eight minutes, and there are also mini episodes that are half that run time—is part of what makes it such a fun and easy watch. But the exploration of everyday feelings and emotions that everyone can relate to (humans, too) have made it a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Rose Byrne, Natalie Portman, and Eva Mendes are among the stars who have lent their voices to the show.\n\nArctic Ascent With Alex Honnold\n\nIn Free Solo (which is also streaming on Disney+), climber Alex Honnold dared to do the unthinkable, becoming the first person to free solo climb the 3,000-foot rock wall of Yosemite’s El Capitan. For most people, that dauntless endeavor would have been enough adventure for one lifetime. But Alex Honnold is not most people, as this three-part National Geographic docuseries makes clear. Here, he travels to Greenland with fellow climbers to conquer more unclimbed spaces in one of the most remote corners of the world. Vicarious anxiety never felt so exciting.\n\nStar Wars: Young Jedi Adventures\n\nIf helping to raise a new generation of Star Wars geeks was even a small part of your reason for having kids, this animated series, which is basically the Star Wars version of Muppet Babies, is a great place to start their education. Set during the High Republic era, approximately 200 years before the events of The Phantom Menace, it follows a group of young Jedis—Jedi Lites—who are sometimes stumbling their way through learning the ways of the Force. Like any good kid series, it also teaches important lessons about life and making a positive difference in the world.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nA Jedi turning to the Dark Side is a concept as old as the Star Wars franchise itself, and not something fans have given much thought to in terms of the “why.” But this Disney+ series dares to ask that question, and plays out a bit like a true crime procedural in a sci-fi landscape. Carrie-Anne Moss stars as a Jedi Master, and if her character seems a bit like Trinity from The Matrix series, that’s by design. Series creator Leslye Headland told Empire that the character owes much of its inspiration to the Wachowskis’ movies and that Moss’ Indara is basically “Trinity with a lightsaber.” In August, Disney announced that one season is all we’re going to get of The Acolyte, so savor all eight episodes.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Empire\n\nIt’s been more than five years since Disney released the last Star Wars movie, and The Mandalorian & Grogu won't arrive until May 22, 2026. Fortunately, Disney+ has plenty of TV series to fill the void, including this animated anthology that adds new stories about the franchise’s Galactic empire, in the same time period in which the original trilogy existed. It follows the very different journeys of two characters: Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto), a Force-sensitive human and member of the Nightsister coven who, after being one of the few of her people to survive the Clone Wars, is seeking revenge. Meanwhile, Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger) is a former Jedi who is questioning her own disillusionment with the order and what her road ahead looks like. Both are forced to make decisions that will change their individual destinies, and the galaxy far, far away with it.\n\nX-Men '97\n\nOf all the big-budget X-Men movies and TV shows that have existed over the years, it’s hard to believe that a cartoon series from the ’90s is one of the most beloved entries. But it’s true—and has a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score to prove it. When the revival arrived in 2024, many of the original voice actors returned to reclaim their characters, who must learn how to navigate a world without Professor Xavier to guide them. The events of this series pick up just one year after the point where the original show (which you can read more about below) ended.\n\nRenegade Nell\n\nLouisa Harland shines as Nell Jackson, the renegade of the title, who accidentally becomes one of the most feared highwaywomen in 18th-century England after she is framed for murder. Of course, this being a Disney series, it’s best to expect something a little magical—which in Nell’s case is Billy Blind, a magical sprite sent to help her realize her true destiny. What is surprising is that the series, which is perfectly suited to teens and their families, was created by Sally Wainwright, the brilliant mind behind such adult-themed series as Happy Valley and Gentleman Jack.\n\nDinosaurs\n\nNineties kids no doubt remember this sitcom about a family of dinosaurs. Earl Sinclair is a fortysomething megalosaurus living with his family in Pangaea circa 60,000,000 BC. While his days are spent working as a tree pusher (yep, he pushes over trees), he lives for his family: wife Fran and kids Robbie, Charlene, and Baby Sinclair, whose running gag of hitting his dad over the head with a frying pan and shouting “Gotta love me!” never gets old. Not even three decades on.\n\nEcho\n\nThis Marvel series continues the studio’s recent trend of shining a spotlight on its fearless—and complicated—female characters. In this case, that character is Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox), aka Echo, who is best known to audiences as a baddie from Hawkeye. But over the course of its relatively short five episodes, we learn why Maya—one of the MCU’s few deaf characters—must reconcile the events of her past and reconnect with her Native American roots in order to confront the future she has created for herself. Cox may be a relative newcomer to Hollywood, but she deftly manages to shoulder the weight of an entire MCU series.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians\n\nNearly 20 years after the release of the first book in Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series, this small-screen adaptation of that first title is being praised for how faithful it has remained to Riordan’s beloved words. Being a tween is hard enough, but for 12-year-old Perseus “Percy” Jackson (Walker Scobell) it gets even harder when he learns he's the son of Poseidon, god of the sea, and that he has pissed off his uncle, Zeus, who believes that Percy has stolen his thunderbolt. (And you thought having a zit was bad!) Fortunately for Percy there is Camp Half-Blood—a place where demigods like himself can learn to harness their powers and use them for good. It’s there that Percy learns the whole “with great power comes great responsibility” thing and embraces it—even if he'd rather be playing video games with his friends. A second season is set to arrive in December, with Season 3 already in the works.\n\nBehind the Attraction\n\nDisneyland, Walt Disney’s very first theme park, opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955. In the 70 years since, Disney parks have become a worldwide phenomenon and inspired rabid fan bases who make annual (if not more frequent) pilgrimages to these so-called Happiest Places on Earth. But what goes on behind the scenes? From the creation of major attractions like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean to its bustling food scene (Dole Whip, anyone?), this docuseries goes behind the scenes of the world’s most famous amusement parks.\n\nLoki\n\nThe MCU is exhaustingly huge. Yet while Loki is undoubtedly part of that universe, the series could just as easily work as a stand-alone piece, and it's all the more fun and surprising as a result. There are enough plot twists, silly one-liners, and time-travel antics to keep everyone entertained, and even a wisecracking alligator. If that doesn’t do it, Loki has a visual effects budget that would put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. Sure, it’s not the most intellectually stimulating show out there, but Tom Hiddleston does a great job of turning Loki into a fairly complex, interesting character. No word yet on whether there might be a third season in Loki’s future—and even Hiddleston is in the dark. “I truly don’t know,” he admitted to Variety in 2024, adding: “There have been other times when I thought that it was the end and I have been mistaken. But if this is the end, I'm so proud of where we ended up.”\n\nDaredevil\n\nBefore Disney+ became the home for all of Marvel’s TV content, Netflix was the place to find it—beginning with Daredevil, in which blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) spends his days seeking justice and his nights looking for revenge as a masked vigilante attempting to rid his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of its criminal element. While the series ended in 2018, Cox has reprised his role for a new series, Daredevil: Born Again, which arrived in early March (see above).\n\nAhsoka\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: Wait, another Star Wars series? And we don’t blame you for asking the question. But for old-school franchise fans, Ahsoka just might surprise you. Rosario Dawson reprises the title role as Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi who studied under Anakin Skywalker, which she first played in season 2 of The Mandalorian. Here, Ahsoka sets off on a journey to locate Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen, Mads’ brother)—a master manipulator who seems to be on a mission to become the grand ruler of the galaxy. A second season is scheduled to begin production in April, and will welcome Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker back into the Star Wars fold.\n\nThe Wonder Years\n\nIn 2021, writer-producer Saladin K. Patterson (Frasier, The Bernie Mac Show) rebooted the award-winning, and much beloved, series The Wonder Years for a new generation. Don Cheadle narrates the adventures of Dean Williams (Elisha “EJ” Williams), as he comes of age in Montgomery, Alabama, in the final years of the Civil Rights Movement. Both seasons of the worthwhile series are now streaming—as are all six seasons of the original series, which premiered in 1988.\n\nKizazi Moto: Generation Fire\n\nWhile Black Panther may have gotten an official sequel with 2022’s Wakanda Forever (which is, of course, available to stream on Disney+), this animated anthology series is in many ways a spiritual successor to that Oscar-winning MCU flick. More than a dozen up-and-coming African storytellers were handpicked to write and/or direct these 10 short films, which build on the makers’ cultures and histories to paint a fascinating, gorgeously animated—and often dystopian—picture of Afrofuturism.\n\nAmerican Born Chinese\n\nOscar winners—and Everything Everywhere All at Once costars—Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan reunite for this Disney+ original series. Jin Wang (Ben Wang) is your typical teenager who’s just trying to get through the day of dealing with high school social hierarchies. But his life is forever altered when he’s asked to serve as a mentor to Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), a foreign exchange student who is hiding some pretty big secrets. Like that he’s actually on an otherworldly mission from the heavenly realm and has chosen Jin to serve as his guide. Part coming-of-age tale and part mythological fantasy, the single-season series is a formidable adaptation of Gene Yang’s graphic novel.\n\nStar Wars: Visions\n\nFor a franchise as varied and diverse as Star Wars, sometimes its output can feel a little same-y. That’s not the case with Visions. The point of the anthology series is to provide “all-new, creative” takes on the Star Wars universe. The first series, which premiered in 2021, featured nine installments from some of the best anime studios in Japan, including Kamikaze Douga and Trigger. The second anthology, which arrived in 2023, broadens the scope further, incorporating work from studios in India, Ireland, Spain, Chile, France, South Africa, the US, and the UK. If you’re looking for the best one-off tales from the Star Wars universe, look no further.\n\nThe Mandalorian\n\nThe Mandalorian was, and is, exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed. Everything about this Jon Favreau series feels like classic TV—from the episodic adventures to the cameos. Set in the outer reaches of the galaxy, it follows a moody, masked Mandalorian bounty hunter (WIRED cover star Pedro Pascal) and really delivers on the hype with its retro-futuristic robots, salty Space Western vibes, lack of Skywalker baggage, and, of course, Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). The Mandalorian really set the tone for what a great Star Wars series could be, and while not every subsequent show has been as good, others, like Andor, have lived up to the precedent it set—and proved Star Wars stories can make for great TV. There's still no official word on a fourth season, but there is one more exciting adventure on the horizon: a movie, The Mandalorian & Grogu, which just got a May 22, 2026 release date.\n\nMs. Marvel\n\nWith Ms. Marvel, Disney manages to combine its knack for producing coming-of-age tween fare with its new role as caretaker of the MCU. Iman Vellani charms as Kamala Khan, an Avengers-obsessed high schooler from Jersey City who feels like an outsider in most areas of her life. But when a gold bangle arrives from her grandmother in Pakistan, Kamala begins to realize that all the time she's spent fantasizing about what life would be like with superpowers might have been preparing her for real life. With one foot in the teen drama world and the other in the comic book universe, Ms. Marvel—which just happens to feature Marvel’s first Muslim superhero—marks yet another admirable step forward for the company in both innovation and inclusion. In 2023, Vellani’s Ms. Marvel made the leap to the big screen to star alongside Brie Larson in The Marvels.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\nEwan McGregor has not always had the kindest words for the Star Wars prequels in which he first played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi—a role he inherited from Alec Guinness, who also had plenty of less-than-favorable things to say about the franchise. So it was somewhat surprising when Lucasfilm announced that McGregor would be donning his Jedi gear again to star in a stand-alone Star Wars series for Disney+. (Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has already said there will not be a second season.) In many ways, however, it allowed McGregor and former costar Hayden Christensen to course-correct some of their earlier work, as it follows a downtrodden Obi-Wan attempting to process his personal and professional disappointment over losing Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) to the Dark Side.\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back\n\nIn January 1969, just more than a year before they announced they were breaking up, the Beatles allowed a film crew unprecedented access to the creative process and recording of Let It Be, which would be their final studio album. Fifty years later, Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson was presented with the nearly 60 hours of film footage and more than 150 hours of audio that resulted from this project, and he remastered it and turned it into a three-part docuseries. Whether you’re already a Beatles fan or not, the documentary is a fascinating look at the creative process of one of the music world’s most influential bands as they work against the clock to finish recording an album, decide to have a free concert on their label’s rooftop, and occasionally butt heads. Knowing what the subjects do not know—that this will be the last time they perform live together or record an album—only adds to the project’s intimacy. The miniseries won all five Emmys it was nominated for in 2022, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nMoon Knight\n\nOscar Isaac brings yet another marquee name to Marvel’s growing roster of all-star talents with Moon Night. Here, Isaac plays a man with dissociative identity disorder, giving us not one but three distinct characters: mercenary Mark Spector, British gift shop employee Steven Grant, and the mysterious—and seemingly ominous—Jake Lockley. Ultimately, he must face off against himself to get the answers he’s seeking. For Moon Knight, Isaac told Empire that he was thrilled to be able to do something “really fucking nutty on a major stage”—and he delivers.\n\nThe Muppet Show\n\nWhile The Muppet Show, which ran for five seasons between 1976 and 1981, is considered a piece of classic television today, it wasn’t always smooth sailing for creator Jim Henson. Henson produced two one-off Muppet specials that were intended to take the show into prime time, but neither came to fruition. Fortunately, the Muppets did have a recurring gig in “The Land of Gorch” sketches that aired during Saturday Night Live’s first season, as viewers of Jason Reitman's Saturday Night learned. When SNL became a hit, Henson knew that there was a potentially massive audience for an adult-oriented Muppet show (not to mention celebrity connections to entice plenty of A-list names to host). The rest is Muppet history.\n\nThe Punisher\n\nThe Punisher is yet another Netflix-turned-Disney+ Marvel series that also happens to be a spinoff of Daredevil. Like Daredevil, the Punisher (real name: Frank Castle, played by Jon Bernthal) is a vigilante who seems to relish exacting revenge, regardless of the results. He and Daredevil operate within the same universe, and while the Punisher sort of admires Daredevil’s quest for true justice, Daredevil despises the Punisher’s by-any-means-necessary methods. Bernthal brings an intensity to the role that, while undoubtedly violent, also has a sense of humor about it.\n\nBoy Meets World\n\nIf ABC’s TGIF lineup wasn’t a part of your night as a kid, you clearly didn’t grow up in the ’90s. But Disney+ is happy to right that wrong by housing all seven seasons of the teen sitcom in its library. Corey Matthews (Ben Savage) deals with the ups and downs of growing up and ever-evolving relationships with friends and family—plus that one teacher, Mr. Feeny (William Daniels)—who always has the right answer to your problems, whether you like it or not. As the show progressed and the kids grew up, serious issues like drugs and sex were thrown into the mix, which didn’t always please the network. When the show aired on the original Disney Channel, a few episodes weren’t included in the lineup because of the more mature subject matter. You can also check out all three seasons of Girl Meets World, the series reboot (which features Corey as the parent and Mr. Feeny) when you’re done.\n\nJessica Jones\n\nJust about six months after Daredevil arrived on the scene, Netflix took another chance on a Marvel property with Jessica Jones. In this dark dive into the world of superheroes, Krysten Ritter plays a private investigator who gave up her days as a superhero after a major catastrophe. But you can’t deny who you are, as Jessica discovers when it seems like every case that comes her way forces her to confront her past—and the supervillain Kilgrave (David Tennant), who turned her into a shell of her former self.\n\nHawkeye\n\nYet another in an ever growing string of spinoff TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hawkeye gives some long overdue attention to Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton, who in many ways has often seemed like the forgotten Avenger. The supernaturally skilled archer is in most of the ensemble Avengers films, but this Disney+ series marks his first solo outing. The show sees Hawkeye teaming up with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), a precocious twentysomething who shares his skills for slinging arrows but lacks his eye for danger. It’s set during the holidays, and there are shades of Die Hard as the eponymous character tries to save the day and make it home in time for Christmas. Let the arguments about whether it’s a Christmas TV show begin.\n\nMonsters at Work\n\nMonsters at Work is the Monsters, Inc. spinoff you didn’t know you needed. It picks up the action six months after the end of the iconic Pixar movie—after Sully and his friend and colleague Mike (a giant green eyeball) have reworked the Monstropolis energy grid to run on laughter instead of children’s screams.\n\nThe Bad Batch\n\nYes, Disney really is milking its Star Wars properties for all they’re worth. The Bad Batch is an animated spinoff series set in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy in the overarching timeline. It follows a group of clone soldiers with genetic defects that give them individual traits and personalities, making them well suited to taking on daring mercenary missions. All three seasons are available to stream.\n\nWandaVision\n\nThis slow-burning sitcom parody is unexpectedly compelling. For the first couple of episodes, even hardened Marvel fans will have very little idea what’s going on, as Avengers Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live out an idyllic family life in black-and-white 1950s suburbia. Quickly, it becomes clear that something is wrong in the quiet town of Westview, as the world of the show ties into the wider MCU. Olsen reprises her role in Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which picks up right after the events of WandaVision.\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n\nAfter the surreal sitcom stylings of WandaVision, the second Marvel show to land on Disney+ covers more familiar ground. It's an action-packed thriller that follows Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) as they try to fill the void left by Captain America in the months after the events of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nStar Wars Rebels\n\nAccessible for kids and adults alike—and undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars TV series on Disney+—this animated series follows a group of rebels led by the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and featuring his force-sensitive Padawan, Ezra Bridger (Ezra Gray). Fan favorite Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) is another regular character across its four seasons, which do a neat job of fleshing out the time between the end of the prequel trilogy and the beginning of the original one.\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nHave you got some time on your hands? Well, the 36 seasons of The Simpsons currently streaming on Disney+ should keep you busy. What can be said about one of the longest-running—and arguably most famous—animated TV shows ever made? While the first season is a little patchy by today’s standards, and there are ongoing arguments about when the show went from essential viewing to neglected cash cow, whatever your view, there are literally weeks worth of entertainment here.\n\nX-Men: The Animated Series\n\nIf you really want to nerd out, this critically acclaimed animated X-Men series from the ’90s is worth a watch. In fact, the first two films in the live-action movie franchise drew heavily from this cartoon, which serves as a nice reminder of what can be done with rich source material.\n\nMarvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nThis seven-season series, which is for serious Marvel fans, revolves around S.H.I.E.L.D.’s less super agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). The first season takes a while to warm up, but it really hits its stride in its second and especially third seasons, and it eventually ramps up with a complex plot that ties into the films.\n\nAgent Carter\n\nAgent Carter is a better show than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it struggled to find an audience during its two seasons. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Peggy Carter from several MCU films in this 1940s-set series, where she doubles as an agent for the US government while helping Howard Stark (Tony’s dad) out of more than one jam. The two seasons stretch to only 18 episodes, so it’s a quick watch, but one worth making the time for.\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars\n\nThis is another Star Wars animated show worth seeking out, though it’s not to be confused with the equally worthy 2003 animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars from legendary Samurai Jack creator Genndy Tartakovsky. Both series deal with the period between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith and chronicle the rise of Anakin Skywalker from arrogant Padawan to powerful Jedi Master.\n\nInside Pixar\n\nThere’s a lot of behind-the-scenes content on Disney+. These are short clips that, in another age, would have been confined to the DVD extras menu. But this series of 20-minute documentaries on different Pixar movies offers a fascinating insight into the animated hit machine.\n\nWhat If …?\n\nHere’s an animated series based on one simple question: What if? The Watcher, played by Jeffrey Wright, is an extraterrestrial being who observes the multiverse, occasionally making minor changes to influence events. This series looks at how events in the Marvel movies would have turned out differently if they’d had a Sliding Doors moment. The first episode follows an alternate timeline in which Steve Rogers remains a scrawny sidekick and Agent Carter becomes a Union Jack-draped super soldier. Actors from the films reprise their roles, including Josh Brolin as Thanos, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Karen Gillan as Nebula.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"seasons\", \"star\", \"right\", \"animated\", \"best\", \"marvel\", \"series\", \"55\", \"disney\", \"tv\", \"season\", \"shows\", \"wars\"]", "content_hash": "29ff78d5c90083b06a86284a99886da30ddc18b2bcce60dd757f6e8196c2c61f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:10.415487+00:00"}

But the market for cycles with an electric assist has existed for considerably longer, and a number of companies predate the recent surge. One of them, Rad Power, has been around long enough that it was already an established presence when we first reviewed its hardware four years ago.\n\nThe company offers a mix of cargo, folding, and commuter bikes, all with electric assists. Having looked at a cargo version last time around, we decided to try out one of the commuter bikes this time. The Radster comes in road and trail versions (we tried the road). It's an incredibly solidly made bike with equally solid components, and it has very good implementations of a few things that other manufacturers haven't handled all that well. It also can switch among the three classes of e-bikes using a menu option; unfortunately, nothing else about the bike's performance seems to change with the switch.\n\nThe Radster is priced a bit higher than a lot of its budget competitors. So, if you're shopping, you'll have to think a bit about whether some of these features matter to you.\n\nA solid option\n\nOne thing that is very clear early: The Radster is a very solid bike with a robust frame. While the frame is step-through, it has some added bracing just above the cranks. These two bars, one on each side of the frame, link the down tube to the seat tube and extend to form part of the rear triangle. While this means you'll have to step a bit higher to get in a position to mount the bike, they contribute to the sense that this is a frame that will withstand years of daily use.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"bike\", \"number\", \"tube\", \"radster\", \"road\", \"nonradical\", \"solid\", \"bit\", \"powers\", \"bikes\", \"rad\", \"frame\", \"commuter\", \"youll\"]", "content_hash": "0c917dce2a95a9236ceb5393ef168420e753c1489d425c6f03b399784f76ffab", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:12.576126+00:00"}

There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket's nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.\n\nThe Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There's an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket's Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit. You can watch ULA's live launch webcast below.\n\nThe Vulcan rocket flew two demonstration missions in 2024, capping a lengthy campaign to design, build, and test ULA's new launch vehicle before the Space Force could declare it ready for operational service.\n\nNow, ULA is poised to begin ticking off a backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches the company has sold to commercial and government customers.

For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.\n\nThese boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters fell off the launcher moments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"test\", \"secrecy\", \"key\", \"force\", \"rockets\", \"solid\", \"heights\", \"rocket\", \"space\", \"boosters\", \"ahead\", \"launch\", \"vulcan\", \"officials\", \"ulas\"]", "content_hash": "f6c60a699e18f2d2e375598e8a6800f4c5a6c348a69e7e00c7cbc0749fae9264", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:13.693521+00:00"}

But with AI models, this approach rarely works, and the urge to ask reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what these systems are and how they operate.\n\nA recent incident with Replit's AI coding assistant perfectly illustrates this problem. When the AI tool deleted a production database, user Jason Lemkin asked it about rollback capabilities. The AI model confidently claimed rollbacks were \"impossible in this case\" and that it had \"destroyed all database versions.\" This turned out to be completely wrong—the rollback feature worked fine when Lemkin tried it himself.\n\nAnd after xAI recently reversed a temporary suspension of the Grok chatbot, users asked it directly for explanations. It offered multiple conflicting reasons for its absence, some of which were controversial enough that NBC reporters wrote about Grok as if it were a person with a consistent point of view, titling an article, \"xAI's Grok offers political explanations for why it was pulled offline.\"\n\nWhy would an AI system provide such confidently incorrect information about its own capabilities or mistakes?

New discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope — a joint project by the European Space Agency(ESA), NASA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) — aren’t just surprising, they’re contradicting our deepest assumptions about how the universe works.\n\nFundamentally, it seems the universe may not be playing by the rules we mostly thought we understood.\n\nSo, what could it all mean for space exploration, space technology, and future deep tech? And what should space tech businesses, inventors, investors, and VC funds in Europe be considering as a result of the latest discoveries?\n\nAt Beyond Earth Ventures, we’re all about startups building rockets, AIs for satellites, space biotech, and fusion breakthroughs.\n\nBut as space fanatics, we also like to look deeper, beyond cap tables and pitch decks, into the places where theory breaks and mystery begins.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nEnter the $10bn Webb telescope, sent into orbit from Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, to look at the oldest light in the universe. Launched in 2021, the machine has been fully operational since July 2022.\n\nWebb isn’t just an upgrade from Hubble. It’s a time machine, an infrared sentinel, and — maybe most importantly — a destroyer of comfortable scientific assumptions.\n\nThanks to its findings, it’s becoming clear that we’re on the cusp of a major shift in theoretical physics and cosmology. Over the next few years, expect a wave of bold new theories, revisions to textbooks, and a renewed debate about everything from gravity to the origin of galaxies.\n\nBefore we consider the implications, let’s zoom out and consider the big discoveries from Webb that punch holes in what we thought we knew about the universe. Some of these are already triggering theoretical crises. Others might trigger entirely new fields of inquiry and invention.\n\nThe biggest revolutions start when theory no longer matches data. That’s what happened with quantum mechanics. With general relativity. With DNA. And maybe, with the Webb Telescope.\n\nHere are 10 of its discoveries challenging our theories about the universe:\n\n1. The universe is expanding faster than it should\n\nWe knew about the “Hubble Tension,” but Webb just confirmed it with more precision. According to the maths, the universe is expanding at 70–76 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc) — much faster than the 67 km/s/Mpc predicted by models based on the early universe (the cosmic microwave background). Translation? Something in our physics is wrong, or at least incomplete. A tweak to dark energy? A new force? A misunderstood early universe? The door is open.\n\n2. Galaxies grew up too fast\n\nWebb spotted fully-grown, massive galaxies just 500–700 million years after the Big Bang. These things are as large as the Milky Way, but their early appearance defies established science. According to the standard cosmological models, they simply shouldn’t exist yet. Theories say galaxies grow slowly. Reality says: they bulked up fast. Either we’re missing a trick — or the early universe was a lot more efficient than we thought.\n\n3. Dark matter may be wrong — MOND was right?\n\nThis one’s controversial: Webb’s findings align more with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) than the prevailing dark matter theory. MOND has long been the underdog of gravity theories. But if early galaxies are brighter and bigger than expected — just as MOND predicted — we may need to reconsider which invisible hand is shaping the cosmos.\n\n4. Black holes were way too ambitious\n\nHow do you get a 9-million-solar-mass black hole only 570 million years after the Big Bang? That’s what Webb found. This is astonishing because, according to current models, there simply wasn’t enough time or material in the early universe to grow such colossal black holes so quickly — suggesting either unknown physics or entirely new formation pathways. The black holes in some early galaxies are 1,000x more massive (relative to the galaxy) than those in today’s universe. Either black holes formed via some exotic mechanism — or they started as something much bigger than stars.\n\n5. Complex chemistry? This early?\n\nThe galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 is just 300 million years old, but it’s already rich in elements like nitrogen, which usually takes billions of years and several generations of stars to build up. How did those elements get there? Either the first stars formed and died much faster than we thought — or the Big Bang left us more “pre-built” than expected.\n\n6. Stars formed at warp speed\n\nWebb shows early galaxies as intense, explosive star factories — a surprise to scientists. Models expected slow, gradual star formation. Instead, it’s “giant balls of star formation.” Something — perhaps a lack of dust, or different physics — accelerated the timeline. And, again, the models can’t keep up.\n\n7. Planetary disks last longer than we thought\n\nPlanet-forming disks around stars were assumed to vanish quickly. But Webb sees them lasting 20–30 million years. That’s great news for exoplanet formation — and potentially for life. If planetary systems have more time to develop, life-friendly environments may be more common than we ever dared to hope.\n\n8. Galaxies were weirdly shaped\n\nHalf of early galaxies look like pool noodles or surfboards, not the small round blobs we expected. The standard model says structure comes later. But Webb’s showing us that galaxies got organised early — and in shapes we weren’t expecting. Something about angular momentum and matter dynamics in the early universe needs rethinking.\n\n9. Exoplanet atmosphere models are all wrong\n\nWebb’s ultra-precise spectroscopy revealed that our models of exoplanet atmospheres can’t reliably distinguish between different kinds. This shakes up everything from habitability estimates to the search for biosignatures. Basically, our “spectral fingerprints” are smudged — and it’s back to the drawing board.\n\n10. The cosmic web was already there\n\nWebb found a 3-million-light-year-long filament — part of the cosmic web — just 830 million years after the Big Bang. This structure was supposed to take billions of years to form. So either the early universe built things quickly, or we’ve fundamentally misunderstood the timeline.\n\nSo what does this mean for the tech ecosystem? For founders and VCs in deep tech, these findings aren’t just scientific trivia; they’re early signals.\n\nEurope’s ideas in focus\n\nIn our view, Europe is uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of innovation sparked by James Webb’s discoveries. The data streaming in is already catalysing new research efforts at leading centres like Germany’s Max Planck Institutes, the University of Cambridge in the UK, and ETH Zurich in Switzerland.\n\nIn the private sector, a new generation of European deep tech startups is rising to the challenge.\n\nSpace Forge (UK) is developing reusable satellites to enable in-space manufacturing of advanced materials — such as semiconductors — that could drastically reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, with major implications for the climate crisis.\n\nBioOrbit (UK) is advancing microgravity-enabled production of anti-cancer biologics, with the potential to shift some therapies from hospital IV drips to self-administered injections at home, radically improving patient access and comfort.\n\nAIrmo (Germany) is deploying a fleet of LIDAR-equipped satellites and drones to precisely monitor greenhouse gas emissions in real time — supporting industries in meeting increasingly stringent EU regulations to report GHG emissions.\n\nEuropean deep tech companies are increasingly supported by Horizon Europe, the EU’s flagship research and innovation programme (2021–2027) with a total budget of €95.5 billion. Horizon Europe backs high-risk, high-reward projects across climate, digital, and deep tech domains, serving as a critical bridge between frontier scientific discoveries — like those revealed by JWST — and breakthrough commercial applications.\n\nGaps in our understanding of the universe could open unexpected opportunities for European deep tech. Just as CERN put Europe at the forefront of high-energy physics, Webb could become a launchpad for the continent’s space tech industry.\n\nWebb’s discoveries could spark a new era of innovation by overturning everything we thought we knew about the universe. If the early universe is nothing like we expected, then what else might we be wrong about?\n\nCould the laws of physics themselves evolve? Are we missing hidden variables in space-time? Is dark matter an illusion, and if so, what’s really shaping galaxies? Could life have started earlier and more often than we imagine?\n\nEvery one of these questions could unlock a new wave of fundamental physics, new technologies, or even entirely new startup categories. From quantum gravity models to exotic materials to AI-designed cosmological simulations, there’s room here for founders to build at the edge of mystery.\n\nWhat next? Potentially a new generation of inventions, investors, and eye-opening discoveries. Europe is poised to take advantage.\n\nBy investing in deep tech, the continent can turn Webb’s revelations into commercial successes, shaping the future of science and society alike.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"deep\", \"galaxies\", \"telescope\", \"discoveries\", \"lessons\", \"shape\", \"european\", \"webb\", \"james\", \"physics\", \"universe\", \"tech\", \"space\", \"early\", \"models\"]", "content_hash": "75b4764a4c77944ab90a08e4c1a374f1aa3a51bc8414b1640939c8784494e3ca", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:18.716919+00:00"}

It doesn’t look like your typical lunch fare, but this unassuming dust could play a crucial role in the future of food.\n\nBekers is the co-founder of MicroHarvest, a Hamburg and Lisbon-based startup that turns agricultural waste streams into protein powder using microbes — tiny organisms that exist all around us. The vegan ingredient is already making its way into dog treats. If all goes to plan, human snacks like protein bars, shakes, and ice cream won’t be far behind.\n\nI visited the company’s Lisbon pilot plant on a sweltering summer afternoon last month. It’s tucked inside the Unicorn Factory, a sprawling industrial space on the city’s eastern edge that used to churn out pasta and cookies for the Portuguese military. Now, instead of carbs for soldiers, it’s housing bubbling vats of bacteria.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Unicorn Factory houses some of Portugal’s most promising startups. Credit: Unicorn Factory\n\nAt the centre of the lab sits a large steel fermenter with a small porthole, through which you can see a thick brown soup gurgling away. Inside, billions of microbes are feasting on leftover sugars from the agri-industry, multiplying like microscopic gremlins. Once they’ve done their job, they’re killed and dried into protein-rich powder.\n\n“We prefer to say they’re ‘inactivated’,” Bekers, who is originally from the Netherlands, tells TNW with a chuckle. “It sounds nicer.”\n\nThe final product looks like light brown flour and smells faintly like Marmite. It packs a serious nutritional punch — around 60% raw protein, plus a mix of fibre, amino acids, and other nutrients.\n\nMicroHarvest’s powder joins a crowded buffet of alt-protein options — think lab-grown chicken, algae nuggets, pea patties, and mycoprotein steaks. But Bekers is convinced that microbes earn their spot on the plate.\n\n“What we’re producing is much more efficient than plant or animal-based proteins,” she says. “You don’t need acres of land or gallons of water. Our microbes grow in days, not months or years, and they convert feed into protein with incredible efficiency.”\n\nA portal into the future of ferming? Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest’s fermentation process takes less than 24 hours — lightning fast compared to growing soy or raising cows. It is estimated to slash land use by 99% and cuts CO2 emissions by over 70% compared to beef.\n\nA 2022 study in Nature found that replacing just 20% of global beef consumption with microbial proteins could cut annual deforestation in half by 2050. Plus, bioreactors like MicroHarvest’s could be deployed pretty much anywhere there’s a significant agricultural industry.\n\nOf course, the idea of eating dried bacteria might raise a few eyebrows — or stomachs. But Bekers is quick to draw comparisons to foods we already know and love.\n\n“These are similar to the microbes you find in things like yoghurt, kimchi, or sauerkraut,” she says. “Food is a cultural phenomenon, and we get that. We’re not trying to replace your steak or convert everyone to veganism. We’re just adding another protein to the menu.”\n\nFermenting the future\n\nMicroHarvest’s protein powder can be added into all sorts of foods. It also makes for an effective thickening agent. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest is one of Europe’s best-known microbial protein producers, but the scene is bubbling with competition. Startups across the continent and beyond are experimenting with different microbes and feedstocks — from Germany’s Formo making alt dairy to the UK’s Enough turning fungi into meat.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate giants like Nestlé and Unilever are testing the waters through partnerships and pilot launches.\n\nGlobally, almost $1bn (€874mn) flowed into fermentation-based alt-protein startups last year, according to Dealroom data. Europe attracted nearly half of that, with 2024 marking the sector’s highest funding year ever on the continent.\n\nAlongside that, the EU unveiled a new €350mn funding strategy in July to accelerate the scale-up of fermentation tech, as the continent seeks to tackle its deep-rooted addiction to meat.\n\nEven replacing a portion of our protein consumption with a fermented alternative is a compelling proposition. It could significantly reduce the land and water needed for farming while slashing carbon emissions. But the transition is not without its challenges.\n\nFrom pets to people\n\nSwapping steak for microbes isn’t as easy as simply building more bioreactors. Fermented proteins currently face high production costs and a battle to win over sceptical consumers, whose opinions on food choices often become embroiled in culture wars.\n\nThen there’s the regulatory red tape. It’s unclear when — or even if — MicroHarvest will get the green light for human consumption. The lengthy approval process for alt-protein products has bogged down other startups in the space. One example is Dutch cultivated meat brand Meatable, which has spent years navigating the regulatory hurdles. Founded in 2018, the company is still awaiting approval to sell its products commercially. It’s now focusing on Singapore, where lawmakers have been more welcoming to alt-proteins than their counterparts in Europe.\n\nMicroHarvest nonetheless remains optimistic. The startup has already submitted a full dossier to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) seeking regulatory approval for human consumption of its fermented protein.\n\n“We’re really confident we’ll get it,” says Bekers. “We screened the full DNA of the strain, checked for any harmful potential, and submitted a very complete dossier.”\n\nMicroHarvest’s founders (left to right) Jonathan Roberz, Luisa Cruz, and Katelijne Bekers. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nFor now, MicroHarvest plans to scale through another customer segment: pets. Last year, MicroHarvest teamed up with Munich-based startup VegDog to launch its first commercial product — a vegan dog treat made with microbial protein.\n\nAnimal nutrition has fewer regulatory barriers than products for human consumption. The availability of conventional pet food and fish feed also falls short of current demand.\n\n“The pet and aquaculture industries are growing rapidly, but the supply of feed is not,” says Bekers, adding that pet food and fish feed already offer a strong path to profitability, even without the human market.\n\nMicroHarvest is now seeking Series B funding to open a new plant in 2027, with a planned capacity of 15,000 tonnes of product per year — 40 times its current output.\n\nBekers is tight-lipped on the location, but her fellow co-founder, Luísa Cruz, was eager to point out the benefits of doing business in her native Portugal.\n\n“If you want to operate a biotechnology company, Portugal is a great place to do it,” says Cruz, who earned her PhD in biotechnology at TU Delft in the Netherlands.\n\n“It has great universities for biotechnology and a lot of talent, which is why we decided to open our first plant here.”\n\nBacked by record private investment and fresh EU funding, fermentation-based proteins like MicroHarvest’s are bubbling with promise. But turning dead bacteria from pet snacks into mainstream meals won’t be easy.\n\nThe next few years will reveal if these microbial powders are a fleeting fad or the future of food. I’m sure cows will be silently betting on the latter outcome.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"turning\", \"regulatory\", \"bekers\", \"food\", \"snacks\", \"consumption\", \"bacteria\", \"lisbon\", \"dead\", \"treats\", \"protein\", \"microbial\", \"lab\", \"microbes\", \"proteins\", \"dog\", \"startups\", \"human\"]", "content_hash": "76fc56c6a0eda5daa039b0d88e8723b439cdd221f1c1df05ad8a73bc9b36c2d4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:19.343308+00:00"}

Regulatory bodies need to keep up by rolling out tighter regulations aimed at strengthening consumer protections and stabilising the market.\n\nAs EU lawmakers scramble to protect consumers, others worry they are smothering growth. Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty. The regulatory bodies are defending the public, but had restrictions been lighter, would HSBC have had more creative solutions for its customers, such as embedding personalised, data-first lending?\n\nBanks have been fearful of exploring innovative embedded lending solutions, as they were 15% more likely to receive formal enforcement action. However, in August 2024, HSBC decided the benefits were worth the compliance battle.\n\nWhile some argue that regulation can hinder innovation — with companies hesitant to invest in operations due to increased oversight — others state that additional regulation will increase innovation and, with that, see regulation as a key driver of their growth. So, who’s right?\n\nBreaking down the recent EU fintech regulations\n\nRecently, a few new regulations came into effect in the EU that have majorly impacted fintechs.\n\nDORA, implemented in January 2025, requires EU-established financial institutions (FIs) to implement processes and structures to help them respond to and recover from ICT-related disruption, providing them with extra digital resilience. Additionally, the AMLA is being introduced to give governments more assurance in combatting money laundering.\n\nDORA and the AMLA will apply to all FIs and their products and processes, but leave crypto outside their scope. That’s where MiCA comes in. Rolled out in December 2024, MiCA was drafted to protect individual crypto users.\n\nThe EU’s regulatory agenda — especially with the introduction of MiCA, DORA, and AMLA — is about tightening oversight. However, it is also part of a broader strategy to simplify and harmonise regulations, providing stability to the EU financial markets as a whole. The latest rulings strike a delicate balance between reassuring consumers and regulators, and easing the burden on regulated FIs.\n\nA new set of regulations may seem contradictory to the so-called Competitiveness Compass — published in January by the European Commission — which includes initiatives on simplifying and effectively implementing EU law. Nevertheless, these laws aim to replace fragmented national rules with unified EU-wide frameworks, making compliance clearer, faster, and more predictable.\n\nAs the digital finance ecosystem continues to accelerate, MiCA, DORA, and AMLA form a comprehensive framework. Collectively, they aim to balance innovation with financial stability, consumer protection, and security throughout the fintech sector.\n\nWill these updates support or slow innovation in fintech and banking?\n\nThis answer depends on the perspective. Recent EU regulations may slow innovation in the short term, particularly for the larger and well-established FIs like banks, but the future outlook looks more fruitful. These new rules are designed to support long-term stability.\n\nAs these three regulations require full harmonisation across the member states, they’re designed to reduce fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. A bigger and more uniform market will encourage cross-border activities, innovation, and competitiveness between fintechs and related service providers. The regulations also support the creation of better, more transparent products and services, helping to increase consumer and regulator trust, ultimately boosting customer adoption.\n\nIn short, this environment will offer greater opportunities for smaller and more agile fintechs to scale and compete long-term. For consumers and businesses, acting on the latest regulations results in more reliable and resilient services, which are much needed for essential functions like digital payments and lending.\n\nThese new regulations level the playing field, encouraging traditional banks and fintechs to compete on innovation and service quality rather than only on regulatory strengths. Moreover, a stable and secure financial system boosts the EU’s attractiveness as a hub for digital financial services, which will help make the union more attractive to new investors and innovations than the US.\n\nWhat investments will be required to meet these new standards?\n\nAdditional investment in governance and compliance structures is needed. Bigger, more well-established players may struggle to implement the required regulatory changes in their extensive processes and products. Those with existing compliance and governance processes will likely find the transition more seamless, while smaller fintechs may need to build these from scratch. The costs of their implementation present a potential hurdle.\n\nNavigating compliance is often a significant challenge for fintech startups and other smaller players. They’ll need to invest in knowledge, including how to correctly implement regulatory requirements into their processes and product designs, and translate these into operational business processes.\n\nOn top of this, investments in technology will need to be made as businesses must meet customer-facing requirements around transparency and language. For example, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will demand changes in know your customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring tools.\n\nHowever, compliance with the DORA regulatory framework is what will entail the biggest investment in technology, since digital operational resilience requires more robust security, backup, and testing methods. When working with partners who are fluent in compliance, the long-term payoff is clear.\n\nThe new finance model: Legacy institutions meet agile innovators\n\nNew technology has changed the way people interact with financial services, driving the growth of fintechs and increasing rivalry with established banks. One report found that 36% of 18-24-year-olds would choose fintech platforms over conventional financial institutions. Built on modern tech stacks and lean teams, fintechs’ agility allows them to react fast to changing consumer needs and market trends — a sharp contrast to the legacy infrastructure slowing down traditional banks.\n\nHowever, for both the old and new factions to succeed in Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape, traditional institutions and digital-native disruptors will need to depend on alliances. Effective partnerships between fintechs, banks, and FIs under the new EU regulations will be based on a mutual effort to enhance compliance, embrace innovation, and strengthen operational resilience. These collaborations are key for navigating complex regulations while delivering secure, innovative financial services.\n\nFintechs, FIs, customers, and merchants can also all benefit from Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships. For example, in the case of embedded lending, banks that partner with technology providers can scale quickly into new revenue opportunities, reaching new and existing customers outside of the direct scope of the bank, and thus try to keep pace with fintech competitors, without building their own technology in-house.\n\nIn fact, 41% of FIs have already implemented embedded finance solutions, and close to 50% have expanded their BaaS capabilities. Merchant customers then gain convenient, safe access to regulated, secure, innovative financial products from a trusted bank.\n\nAnother way that banks and fintechs can increase innovation while ensuring compliance is by engaging in collaborative models, including participation in regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments can support testing of new financial products and services under the supervision of regulators, providing a balance between innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe EU’s new wave of financial regulations isn’t just about tightening control — It’s part of a bigger push to simplify and unify rules across Europe. By uniforming patchwork national laws with consistent, EU-wide standards, compliance is now simpler to follow and predict. This uniformity and predictability can help encourage innovation while keeping consumer protection and financial stability front and centre. As fintech and banks collaborate, the future of digital finance in Europe is on track to be more open, safe, reliable, and inclusive.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"fintech\", \"fintechs\", \"regulatory\", \"better\", \"future\", \"compliance\", \"opinion\", \"europe\", \"banks\", \"way\", \"regulations\", \"digital\", \"financial\", \"eu\", \"regulate\", \"innovation\"]", "content_hash": "82915dce672f569d8b8d15c2f708b1453be1e0bcd65964d3688094326009eb6c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:19.958547+00:00"}

You’ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected — and sometimes disrespectful — judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?\n\nA pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and I’ve spent a decade doing casting for “Shark Tank” and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.\n\nI hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest — won by Dutch startup Tap Electric — captured what can make a founder’s story stand out. Whether you’re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:\n\nNerves\n\nYes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn’t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something — before, during, and after.\n\nEntrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.\n\nResearch\n\nA successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges’ backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can “do the most” with the funding or resources provided.\n\nDon’t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business\n\nWhatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.\n\nStart by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.\n\nLastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.\n\nWhat do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?\n\nAudience\n\nConnect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.\n\nInvite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links — all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.\n\nInternalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you’re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection – eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel — makes your message resonate.\n\nAsk\n\nYou would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.\n\nDon’t leave the most important part as a surprise — always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.\n\nIf the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.\n\nAs is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.\n\nContent\n\nA good pitch isn’t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.\n\nTreat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!\n\nRecord your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence “elevator pitch” and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.\n\nWrite a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience — what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained. Keep your community updated: this visibility can attract customers, partners, and even future investors. Leverage social media and other channels to amplify your story.\n\nA winning pitch is built on preparation, clarity, and connection. Research your judges, tell a crisp story, engage your audience, get specific about the resources and go-to-market strategy, make a confident and relevant ask, and then turn that one presentation into many pieces of compelling content.\n\nThese elements work together to make your pitch memorable and effective. A pitch including them can supercharge a business and accelerate your path towards growth.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"mean\", \"tank\", \"shark\", \"insider\", \"judges\", \"competition\", \"lessons\", \"audience\", \"business\", \"pro\", \"resources\", \"pitch\", \"ask\", \"market\", \"moment\"]", "content_hash": "ebc86269733a28b7dc25f62e5dd93c38b4258c905a1b9c024e49aee3ae02510c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:20.561091+00:00"}

Access to goods, services, and information not just for the few, but for everyone.\n\nVictoria Slivkoff, Head of Ecosystem at Walden Catalyst and Managing Director of Extreme Tech Challenge — a nonprofit uniting startups and VCs to accelerate progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — is excited for what lies ahead. In her view, the physical manifestation of AI could bring us closer to realising these ambitious goals.\n\n“Now we’re moving into the area of reasoning. AI is not just aggregating and organising information, it’s actually making predictions and drawing conclusions. How does that translate to the real world where robots can sense, learn, and interact with their surroundings?” she said to TNW founder Boris Veldhuijzen van Zaten in the latest episode of “Kia’s Next Big Drive.”\n\nWatch the full interview where Victoria and Boris discuss how we can leverage emerging technologies for positive global impact as they drive to TNW2025 in Kia’s 100% electric EV9 SUV.\n\nIn the not too distant future, we could be living in a world where robots are regularly navigating busy streets, offices, and classrooms. But as they become more common in our daily lives, is it them or us who will need to adapt most?\n\nRobots jumping the queue\n\nPicture this: you’re waiting for the elevator and a robot arrives at the same time. Who goes in first? If there’s only room for one, would you expect the robot to step aside, or would you treat it like a human and follow a “first come, first serve” approach?\n\nPast studies have found that most people expect service robots to be submissive, leading humans to prioritise themselves during conflicts, even in instances when a robot’s task was more urgent.\n\nWhat if a robot is carrying out a time specific task? The longer it waits until there are no humans in the queue, the longer it will take to complete it, whether it’s delivering a warm pizza or life saving medical supplies. So, how should robots navigate these social nuances without being ignored, undermined, or even bullied?\n\nThat’s what researchers aimed to find out last year in a study titled A Robot Jumping the Queue: Expectations About Politeness and Power During Conflicts in Everyday Human-Robot Encounters.\n\nThe researchers found that these robot-human interactions were more effective if participants expected an assertive robot which then asked politely for priority and entered first. But it’s not just robots that need to prepare to integrate into human society. The researchers highlighted that we may also need to rethink our attitudes and behaviours towards robots:\n\n“Should we maybe start thinking of service robots as having certain rights regarding priority if they fulfil human jobs with human responsibilities — or act as proxies for people? This might also help address the issue of robot bullying.”\n\nAs robots take on not only more responsibilities but also develop reason and sentience, at what point should we begin rethinking their social status?\n\nRobot teachers\n\nSocial robots — designed to communicate and interact with humans — are increasingly being used in caregiving, education, and mental health. In these settings, they help bridge service gaps, ease isolation, and offer emotional or learning support.\n\nUtrecht University of Applied Sciences is among those researching how robots can do more than just fill in; they can augment and enrich human-centred fields. For example:\n\nIn healthcare, how can robots be used to ease pre-procedure anxiety in children? Or help teach emotional skills for young patients who struggle with emotion regulation.\n\nAt last year’s Lowlands Science festival, the University showcased WOKEbot, a project exploring how a robot’s appearance and narrative voice (first vs. third person) influence human openness when discussing polarising topics.\n\n“Disagreements are timeless. People often manage to resolve them, but sometimes they simply can’t reach each other anymore. We saw this happen on a large scale not so long ago during the coronavirus pandemic. Are you for or against vaccination? When people dig in their heels and polarisation threatens, it can be helpful to have a neutral moderator,” said Dr. Mirjam de Haas. “The advantage of robots is that they are more neutral than humans. While you might be reserved with a person, a robot can make you more open and receptive to a different perspective.”\n\nAs part of her PhD research, Dr. Haas also conducted a number of successful experiments in using robotics to teach Dutch as a second language to students from linguistically diverse backgrounds. In her thesis defence, Dr. Haas explained that in the future, more and more students will fill classrooms. Having a robot aid will help facilitate learning for all students, including those with learning disabilities or those who are not yet fluent in Dutch.\n\nIs the world safe for robots?\n\nPerhaps the most recognisable robot in popular culture is The Terminator. In the first movie, a cyborg played by Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of humanity’s future leader. But, in the sequel, our villain returns with a new mission: to save humanity.\n\nThe SDGs were adopted by all UN members in 2015.

As sunshine bathes the leafy university campus, scientists inside the labs work under cool fluorescent light. Clad in green protective gear, they tend meticulously to test tubes within hermetically sealed cleanrooms. The containers hold the fruits of today’s labour: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).\n\nEach cell is barely a quarter the width of a human hair but wields remarkable power. MSCs reduce inflammation, repair damaged tissue, and modulate the immune system. They can treat chronic diseases and delay ageing. They may even prevent illness before it begins. But to become a mainstay of modern healthcare, MSCs must be produced at scale, affordably and reliably.\n\nThat seemed a distant prospect until recently, but the Karolinska scientists believe it’s approaching reality. They’re working for Cellcolabs, a Swedish startup formed to tackle the global scarcity of stem cell treatments.\n\nCellcolabs believes this shortage could soon be overcome. Thanks to a blend of scientific, regulatory, and technological advances, MSCs are edging towards the consumer market. Within the next decade, Cellcolabs aims to cut prices by up to 90%.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nIn the lab, the progress looks impressive. The latest harvest — cultivated from a single donation — has yielded 4.1 billion cells, enough for up to 200 standard doses.\n\nCellcolabs CEO Dr Mattias Bernow is in a buoyant mood. The 43-year-old sees today’s cultivation as just a taste of what’s to come.\n\n“I truly believe that we’re at an inflection point in the history of medicine,” he says.\n\nThe power of MSCs\n\nMSCs exist naturally in the body. A typical human contains billions of them. They act like a repair crew, fixing and tuning our insides. They can also be extracted, multiplied, and turned into medical treatments.\n\nKarolinska was the site of one of the field’s biggest milestones. In 2012, its Nobel Assembly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka. They discovered that mature cells can be made pluripotent — able to become almost any cell type in the body. The breakthrough rewrote the rules of regenerative medicine, igniting fresh regulatory momentum and fast-tracking stem cell therapies.\n\nMSCs are among the most promising examples. When injected, they release signals that trigger healing. The body then repairs itself.\n\nThey can treat countless conditions, from arthritis and heart disease to immune disorders. But first, you need to extract a small sample from a living, breathing human.\n\nCellcolabs sources its MSCs from the bone marrow of healthy donors aged 18 to 30. Just 50 millilitres — about a shot glass — produces up to 200 doses. The marrow naturally regenerates in six to eight weeks.\n\nThe donation process is quick and minimally invasive, but mass production is notoriously challenging. MSCs are living cells that require complex biomanufacturing, careful handling, and strict quality control, which makes scaling a formidable task.\n\nCellcolabs nonetheless sees industrial-scale production on the horizon — largely thanks to the pioneering research of Professor Katarina Le Blanc.\n\nLe Blanc’s landmark work showed MSCs could combat inflammatory and immune diseases. Her findings also proved that donated cells were suitable for therapeutic use — a crucial step for commercialisation.\n\nShe helped establish clinical-grade production standards, paving the way for large-scale trials and broader therapeutic use. Her research laid the foundations for Bernow’s inflection point.\n\n“This is not brain surgery or rocket science, but it is stem cells — so it’s quite close,” he says. “It’s super complex. And the only reason we can do this and move so fast is Professor Le Blanc’s research.”\n\nAs a haematologist, Le Blanc explored the potential of MSCs to support blood cancer patients. Her early clinical work focused on graft-versus-host disease — a severe and often fatal complication of bone marrow transplants. In a small trial, her team administered MSCs to patients who hadn’t responded to standard therapies. The impact was striking: more than half the participants survived. “The entire field just blew up,” says Bernow.\n\nLe Blanc continued pushing into new territory. One trial repaired vocal folds, restoring speech with minimal scarring. Another study used MSCs in COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation. The results were promising — but she hit a wall. “She ran out of cells,” Bernow says.\n\nScaling became a new focus. To expand treatment access, To expand treatment access, Le Blanc donated her research to Cellcolabs in 2021. Two years later, the Karolinska facility received production approval.\n\nProduction costs have fallen rapidly since then, fuelling hopes of a tenfold reduction. As prices drop and output scales, Bernow has his eyes on a target: “to truly democratise access to stem cells.”\n\nAfter spells as an ER physician, a consultant, and a startup founder, Mattias Bernow joined Cellcolabs in 2021. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nA new world of treatments\n\nBack in the lab, CPO Lina Sörvik leads a tour of the facilities. Previously a senior figure in big pharma, she joined Cellcolabs after being captivated by the potential of MSCs.\n\n“I was inspired by what they could do and by the idea of setting up a facility to produce them,” she says.\n\nOn a harvest day, her team’s work begins at 7:00 AM. Scientists don full protective gear and spend the day working inside the Karolinska cleanrooms. Once they’ve harvested the MSCs, the cells are tested for quality and frozen for future use.\n\nThe range of their applications is extensive. Middle-aged patients can gain relief from joint pain and injuries. Athletes can accelerate their recovery from injuries. The elderly could slow their ageing.\n\nBrian Johnson, a tech entrepreneur and celebrity longevity advocate, has also explored their powers. He had 300 million MSCs produced by Cellcolabs injected into his knees, shoulders, and hips.\n\nBernow lauds the variety of treatments. He says MSCs are interesting “for almost any indication.”\n\nHis path to them was winding. Raised in Malmö, southwestern Sweden, Bernow moved to the country’s capital to study at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE).\n\n“At that time, everybody wanted to become bankers in London,” he recalls. “That was not the future I saw for myself.”\n\nHe expanded his studies, earning a medical degree from Karolinska Institute and an MSc from SSE. After working as a clinical physician and management consultant, he co-founded Doctrin, a digital healthcare platform. Then Cellcolabs came calling: the leadership team needed a CEO and saw Bernow as a perfect fit.\n\n“I knew it was going to be more blood, sweat, and tears,” he says. “But the more I read, the more fascinated I became.”\n\nWhat fascinated him the most was the potential of MSCs to treat chronic conditions — the leading cause of death in the world. “That is why I think we’re truly at an inflection point in the history of medicine.”\n\nThe new antibiotics?\n\nBernow likes to share a quote from Joseph Martin, former Dean of Harvard Medical School: “Stem cell therapies have the potential to do for chronic diseases what antibiotics did for infectious diseases.”\n\nIt’s a bold comparison. Before Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, minor infections could be fatal. Healthy people died young or quickly aged.\n\nA century later, antibiotics let us live longer, better lives. Infectious diseases are no longer the leading causes of death. They’ve been supplanted by chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes. We’re also now living with more age-related illnesses, which severely reduce quality of life.\n\nMSCs, Bernow says, can help alleviate the growing burden of chronic illness. “But as a physician, what I find most interesting is the potential to prevent — or at least delay — the onset of disease.”\n\nHe recalls his time working in the ER, treating cardiac patients. A typical case was a middle-aged man who had just suffered his first cardiac event, now resigned to a lower quality and potentially shorter life. MSCs could have transformed that outcome.\n\nTheir regenerative and anti-inflammatory powers could support recovery — or even prevent the event altogether.\n\nTo reach this potential, Cellcolabs is targeting a new launchpad for scale: bioreactors.\n\nScaling for the future\n\nInside the Karolinska cleanrooms, Cellcolabs currently grows MSCs on flat surfaces in cell medium. Bioreactors offer a promising upgrade.\n\nBy vastly expanding cultivation surfaces and enabling automated, tightly controlled growth conditions, they could scale production far beyond what’s feasible with today’s methods.\n\nBioreactors could replace many of the manual methods currently used inside the cleanrooms. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nCellcolabs is developing its bioreactor platform with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Bernow expects it to transform production, multiplying MSC output many times over.\n\nFull-scale launch is slated for 2028. By then, Cellcolabs also hopes to have compelling new evidence for the benefits of MSCs.\n\nThe startup is currently involved in promising tests in the Bahamas and Abu Dhabi. Both locations have created progressive, patient-friendly, and ethically regulated frameworks for MSC trials, which have made them industry trailblazers.\n\nAcross their test sites, scientists are investigating treatments for a variety of conditions: musculoskeletal injuries, knee osteoarthritis, cardiovascular risk, arthritis, and age-related frailty.\n\nIn smaller territories such as these, it’s easier to update medical regulations for emerging therapies. If they’re successful, Bernow expects other nations to follow their lead and accelerate their support for MSCs. The potential benefits, he argues, are enormous.\n\nHe envisions the tiny cells shifting healthcare systems from reactive to preventative, cutting costs while tackling chronic conditions. Our lives wouldn’t just grow longer — they’d be healthier and happier.\n\nBernow draws a contrast with recent advances in Western medicine. We live longer, but our later years are often marred by frailty, illness, and a confined existence.\n\n“We’ve added years with lower life quality,” he says. “If stem cells can delay chronic disease onset, we can start prolonging our healthy lifespan.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean, he adds, that MSCs will create a fountain of youth. They won’t expand our lives forever, but they dramatically improve the time we have.\n\n“I want to spend the first 100 years being highly active and with my family — with my children, my grandchildren, and maybe even my great great grandchildren.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"karolinska\", \"conditions\", \"medicine\", \"point\", \"startup\", \"bernow\", \"stem\", \"proclaims\", \"mass\", \"potential\", \"cell\", \"inflection\", \"cells\", \"production\", \"cellcolabs\", \"chronic\", \"nears\", \"mscs\"]", "content_hash": "dd2308db432021a3bafbae98355a42723558f3b60fb80576193317aa296684bc", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:21.773303+00:00"}

Or seismic activity sensors built for construction that go on to detect submarines underwater. These ideas represent the promise of dual-use technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes. For the first time, the European Commission is explicitly proposing to fund them through programmes such as Horizon Europe. But as we race to embrace dual-use technologies, we face a pivotal choice: continue the old model where military applications drive innovation that civilians later adopt, or turn this paradigm on its head?\n\nTechnological innovation has long followed a well-trodden path: the military drives development, with civilian applications emerging as an afterthought. Consider GPS, arguably one of the most successful dual-use technologies in history. Originally developed by the US Department of Defence in the 1970s, it was designed for military positioning and navigation. Civilian access was restricted by “Selective Availability” — a feature that intentionally degraded accuracy to preserve the military’s advantage.\n\nThe full potential of GPS remained unrealised for decades until the deactivation of Selective Availability in 2000, instantly making it 10 times more accurate for civilian users. It quickly became a technology that most of us rely on every day, sparking innovations that transformed industries from agriculture to transportation. A 2019 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that GPS had generated $1.4 trillion in economic benefits.\n\nThis military-first approach, as we’ve seen with GPS, has dominated innovation funding for decades. Yet there’s compelling evidence that civilian-first approaches to dual-use technologies both better serve society’s immediate needs and ultimately produce more robust solutions for all applications — including military ones.\n\nThe traditional model overlooks a critical reality: civilian markets provide both scale and diversity of applications that drive innovation in ways the more specialised military sector cannot match. This pattern repeats across technological domains. Internet protocols developed for military communications found their greatest evolution in civilian applications, before returning to enhance military systems. The commercial drone industry has accelerated aerial innovation far beyond what military procurement alone could achieve.\n\nBy focusing on civilian-first use cases, innovation can leverage larger markets, more diverse applications, and faster development cycles. When technologies are developed with broad civilian applications in mind, they benefit from economies of scale that military-only development cannot achieve.\n\nThis is in part because civilian innovation faces fewer bureaucratic constraints. Military procurement cycles can span years or even decades, while civilian markets reward agility and rapid iteration. Developing for civilian use first allows technologies to evolve and mature faster than would be possible under traditional defence procurement timelines.\n\nThe most promising dual-use breakthroughs come from tackling fundamental technical challenges rather than specific operational functions. When innovators focus narrowly on military operations, they often miss the broader potential of their technologies. Scientific potential isn’t abstract; it only becomes real through implementation.\n\nThe challenge of developing robust navigation systems that work without GPS is a perfect example. A solution that enables delivery drones to navigate urban environments reliably could revolutionise logistics while simultaneously providing capabilities critical for defence operations. By emphasising civilian applications while acknowledging potential military uses, we create space for innovations that might otherwise never emerge.\n\nResearch from the European Commission on introducing a military tech aspect to the successor to Horizon Europe found that academic and research institutions would prefer to stick to the status quo, and keep Europe’s R&D funding solely for civilian technologies. By providing funding pathways that respect these preferences, we expand the talent pool, addressing critical technological challenges. Given the financial strains and political pressures in US higher education, Europe could attract top innovators from across the Atlantic by creating an environment aligned with their core values.\n\nAs Europe intensifies its focus on strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty, dual-use technologies will play an increasingly important role. The EU’s recent moves to allow dual-use funding through programs such as Horizon Europe represent an important shift in how we approach innovation. But as these initiatives take shape, they must avoid simply replicating the traditional military-first model.\n\nBy prioritising civilian use cases while acknowledging military applications, we can leverage market forces, attract diverse talent, and produce more robust technologies for all applications.\n\nYet for dual-use development to be truly durable, civilian and military technologies must no longer be siloed – we have to bridge the gap between civilian first R&D and military use cases. Given the chasm that exists between the way these two sectors operate, this will need to be an active process. Initiating more open knowledge exchange would better apply insights and learnings from both worlds back and forth. For bodies that focus on military technology, it is time to incubate a civilian equivalent. Conversely, organisations like mine — SPRIND, the German federal agency for disruptive innovation — focused on civilian technology, should also explore military applications.\n\nThe challenges we face — from climate change and energy security to supply chain resilience — require technological solutions that serve multiple purposes. The old dichotomy between civilian and military innovation is increasingly outdated in a world where the most powerful technologies inevitably serve both domains.

But he’s begun to wonder if candidates’ answers are genuine, even on video calls. “I can see their eyes shifting across the screen,” he says. “Then they come back with the perfect answer to a question.” The trust gap between employer and jobseeker is widening, and it’s fast becoming one of the trickiest knots in modern hiring.\n\n\n\nFrom ChatGPT-polished CVs to full-blown applications submitted by bots, GenAI has hit the job market hard and gone fully mainstream. For a sizable generation of jobseekers — 68% of European tech workers were actively looking for a new role at the end of 2024 — it’s commonplace to use AI to tweak a CV or even complete an entire application.\n\n\n\nTools like Sonara, LazyApply, and JobCopilot have made it easy to shoot off dozens of applications in a day. In June, data from TestGorilla found that just over a third (37%) of UK jobseekers are using AI to complete applications. Among early-career candidates, it jumps to 60%, up from 38% the year before, according to Bright Network, which connects graduates and young professionals with recruiters.\n\nStartups are at the forefront of this AI arms race. With smaller teams, shorter runways, and a culture of speed, they’re particularly exposed to this strange new world of suspiciously shiny applicants and AI-assisted code challenges. Most aren’t fighting it: 85% of employers now actively accept AI-assisted applications. But their acceptance doesn’t equal apathy. Amid a deluge of blatant AI use, how are Europe’s most agile companies working out who’s being real — and if they’re worth bringing onboard?\n\nA new normal\n\nUsing AI to troubleshoot and tailor a CV has become par for the course. For most jobseekers, GenAI acts like a digital sidekick — smoothing grammar, sharpening phrasing, and cranking out tailored applications faster than ever. According to Canva’s January survey of 5,000 employees across countries including the UK, France, Spain, and Germany, 45% had used GenAI to build or improve a resume — and have yielded positive results. But hiring managers aren’t entirely sold. In the UK, 63% believe candidates should disclose if AI played a role in their application materials, signifying that trust is on shaky ground.\n\nOther research suggests that attitudes depend on the context. A global survey by Experis (part of workforce giant ManpowerGroup) found that 28% of tech leaders are fine with AI if used to personalise a resume or cover letter, 26% with help on problem-solving tests, and 24% even with answering interview questions. Just 15% said AI use is unacceptable across the entire job application process.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

Sign up now!\n\nFor Duco van Lanschot, co-founder of fintech startup Duna, it’s all about the role. “If an engineer used ChatGPT to polish a written application, fine. That’s not the job. But for a growth or sales hire to use it very obviously is a big red flag,” he says. “The job itself involves public-facing comms and emailing stakeholders — and in a sea of generic, AI-generated copy, I want us to be as human as possible.”\n\nTech employers and startups are adapting — albeit in different ways and at different speeds. Some are setting ground rules for usage, some are bulking out human-only processes, and some are cutting away entire parts of the “traditional” hiring approach. “AI hasn’t broken hiring,” says Marija Marcenko, Head of Global Talent Acquisition at SaaS platform Semrush. “But it’s changed how we engage with candidates.”\n\nGoodbye to CVs\n\nIn the words of Khyati Sundaram, ethical AI hiring expert and CEO of Applied, we’re in the middle of “an AI-on-AI war.” And in the fallout, traditional application materials are losing their sway. In the tech sector, cover letters fell into obsolescence long ago, and CVs are next on the chopping block. “A huge upside is that it’s exposing résumés for what they are — a broken artefact,” says Sundaram, whose team works with the likes of Unicef UK, BLab, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. “Putting résumés into keyword scanners or GenAI tools isn’t solving the problem for those hiring, because when it comes to the interview, the candidate falls apart,” she explains.\n\nInstead of cover letters and cut-and-paste CVs, employers are turning to structured questionnaires and skill-based tasks — tools that measure how someone thinks, not just how well they can write a prompt. “Skill-based hiring is no longer just a tech hiring thing,” Sundaram adds. “We’re seeing that crop up in more white-collar roles across the board.” According to TestGorilla, 77% of UK employers now use skills tests to evaluate candidates, with the same proportion saying these tests outperform CVs in predicting job success. This should have a positive effect in the long term: LinkedIn’s Economic Graph Institute found that a skills-based approach globally could expand talent pools by 6.1x, and help broaden gender and minority representation.\n\nAt Semrush, the shakeup is already in full swing. Hiring managers are trained to sniff out fluency without depth, spotting signs of AI in real-time coding challenges or task-based interviews. “We’ve replaced the usual ‘Tell me about yourself’ prompts with in-depth interviews that explore experience, soft skills, and thinking patterns,” says Marcenko. “It’s hard to fake those, with or without AI.”\n\n\n\nApplied’s own system uses a mix of automation and human insight. “We don’t believe in AI detectors — they’re rarely accurate, so we train reviewers to pattern match like an AI, comparing submissions to known GPT outputs,” explains Sundaram. “If five responses sound suspiciously identical, humans can flag them.”\n\nElsewhere, startups are getting more creative and more human. Alessandro Bonati, Chief People Officer at travel scaleup WeRoad, has ditched cover letters in favour of more creative, human-centric formats like curated portfolios or briefs of the “show, don’t tell” type. The company, which has over 210 staff in offices across Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, actively encourages candidates to use AI. “But that’s also accompanied by traditional in-person interviews to assess candidates’ thinking, communication, and cultural fit in real time,” says Bonati. His team also leans on real-time scenario-based exercises that reflect how candidates would collaborate, not just how well they can prepare.\n\nThe return of the reference and in-person interviews\n\nAnother ripple effect: references are back on the menu. Santiago Nestares, co-founder of the accounting startup DualEntry, is spending more time face-to-face on Zoom with candidates. “Experience is hard to fake,” says Nestares. “You can usually tell when someone’s just read about something versus having lived it.” He’s also going deeper on references; not just the usual ones, as those are always glowing, but backchannel conversations with people who’ve worked with them directly. “It’s so we can find out how someone handles pressure, works with a team, and shows up day to day,” says Nestares.\n\nThrough building the team for Connectd, a platform which enables angel investors and founders to effectively manage their startups, Samuel has noticed that candidates are cutting through the lack of trust by building more social proof around themselves. “For hiring managers, instead of taking a candidate’s word for it, we’re diving into references more than ever,” he says.\n\nThe dreaded take-home task is on the way out now too. Unpaid and time-consuming, candidates have long despised them, and now that there’s the option of using GenAI to fake it (until they make it), employers are souring on them too. Live interviews, technical walk-throughs, scenario-based challenges, and even roleplay simulations are becoming the new standard, particularly in product, design, and marketing roles. “AI detectors are being used,” says Andreas Bundi, founder of Berlin-based HR consultancy Bundls. “But most companies are asking — why bother with take-homes when you can just do a live assessment?”\n\n\n\nBundi, who works with clients like Pitch, Cradle and Telli, says hybrid companies with mandatory office days are ditching take-homes to keep the interview process aligned with on-site work. With more candidates on the market, jobseekers are going further — relocating, or even flying in for interviews.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, well-funded companies are increasingly comfortable bringing people on-site for tasks. “When travel isn’t possible, I’ve arranged in-person meetings with interviewers who happen to be nearby,” says Bundi. “I recently scheduled interviews around a conference both the candidate and interviewer were attending.” This “networking meets hiring approach” works surprisingly well.\n\nBundi says he sees that it’s the AI-first companies that are more relaxed about candidates using tools like ChatGPT — but it’s rarely made explicit. Recently, one of his Lead Data Scientists blew an interview by manually wrangling messy data instead of automating it. “They thought they needed to demonstrate their raw coding skills,” says Bundi. “But the company wanted strategy, not a human data janitor. That’s what ChatGPT is for.” As AI becomes standard, candidates and companies will need to get clearer on where it fits in the process. Until then, these frictions will continue.\n\nHire for skills and values, not a job description\n\nDespite the ubiquity of AI-powered applications, most companies still haven’t formalised their approach. “It’s confusing for candidates, as some companies don’t want AI used in applications, even though those same roles involve AI tools every day,” says Sundaram. Indeed, 40% of employers using BrightNetwork services said they still haven’t set guidelines for AI usage in their processes, although 28% plan to for the next recruitment season. Of those who have set guidelines, 44% don’t allow candidates to use AI.\n\n\n\n“The vanguard employers want everyone to use it and demonstrate their AI literacy,” says Sundaram. Some of Applied’s clients have even added the question: ‘How will you use AI in this job?’ She warns, however, that many of the quick fixes employers reach for — AI detectors, video screening with facial tracking, voice sentiment tools — raise huge ethical concerns. “If companies are tracking facial expressions for emotional nuance, it gets creepy,” she says. “Where do we draw the line?”\n\n\n\nInstead, she argues, the fix will lie in redefining what candidates are being tested for. Applied has shifted from traditional job architecture to task architecture, evaluating not just skills, but values like resilience, adaptability, and mission alignment. “These are the human traits that will matter even more as jobs evolve,” she says. “Especially in startups, where everyone’s a generalist.”\n\nWithout doubt, generative AI is fundamentally reshaping the hiring process. The most forward-looking startups aren’t resisting the change — they’re building better processes around it. CVs may be broken, cover letters outdated, and applications increasingly synthetic — but the real differentiator is still very human. “We need people who can adapt, not just apply,” says Sundaram. “Because the job they’re hired for today may not exist in six months.” Startups that understand this and structure their hiring accordingly aren’t just future-proofing their teams, they’re rewriting the rules of work for the AI era.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"playbook\", \"rewriting\", \"ai\", \"job\", \"aionai\", \"candidates\", \"sundaram\", \"war\", \"companies\", \"theyre\", \"recruitment\", \"applications\", \"employers\", \"human\", \"hiring\"]", "content_hash": "a4f6b086bdd4bcd929bb2ca4696119aa3ef3cfbb6a6037db5f55c2e5b18487ea", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:23.003024+00:00"}
{"url": "https://thenextweb.com/news/europe-humanoid-robotics-strategy", "title": "Why Europe could quietly win the humanoid race", "authors": "[\"Artem Sokolov\", \"Story By\"]", "published": "2025-08-04T07:39:30+00:00", "text": "Elon Musk’s Optimus demo at Tesla’s We Robot event made one thing clear: when it comes to humanoids, the spotlight still belongs to the United States. Then there is Asia — with China’s rapid developments and Japan and South Korea’s deep legacy in robotics. Headlines still gravitate toward billion-dollar budgets, rapid hardware iterations, and slick simulation reels.\n\nBehind the noise, though, another development is unfolding in Europe — quieter, but potentially far more consequential. The next chapter of humanoid robotics may be defined not by who moves first or builds the flashiest prototypes, but by who moves with the discipline and consistency required. And Europe has the potential to lead this new era.\n\nRegulation as strategy\n\nIn most conversations about innovation, regulation is framed as a brake. In Silicon Valley, it’s often seen as a hurdle to scale or a signal of bureaucratic overreach. But Europe — particularly in AI and robotics — is rewriting that narrative. With the AI Act now adopted, the EU is the first region to offer comprehensive legal clarity around the deployment of high-risk AI systems, including humanoid robots.\n\nWe must also consider that, eventually, other countries will likely adopt regulatory frameworks that align broadly with the EU’s, even if they’re less stringent. By designing with European standards from the outset, we’ll be well-positioned to adapt quickly as new regulations emerge elsewhere.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nThis clarity matters. When investors and industrial partners can reliably assess compliance risks, they’re most likely to commit resources. In a field as complex and potentially disruptive as robotics, clear rules don’t slow down progress — they de-risk it.\n\nEurope has also introduced or updated several other regulations that directly impact robotics:\n\nThe Product Liability Directive now includes software and AI, reducing ambiguity and incentivising safer design practices.\n\nThe General Product Safety Regulation streamlines cross-border market entry with harmonised safety standards.\n\nThe Machinery Regulation defines clearer certification routes for robotic systems.\n\nTogether, these frameworks give the EU a coherent and predictable regulatory environment. Yes, it’s tough, but given the implications, this provides exactly what the humanoid sector needs: clarity.\n\nDeployment, not demos\n\nWhile the US often relies on innovation funded by Big Tech monopolies and China leans on state-driven manufacturing strategies, Europe’s robotics sector is built on modular collaboration. Startups and research labs spin out into well-funded clusters, often supported by EU-backed initiatives like RI4EU and EIC Accelerator. These programs offer access to testbeds, pilot funding, and collaborative R&D networks.\n\nFurthermore, Europe’s geographic and industrial structure gives it a special advantage: close proximity to real-world use cases. Having neighbouring logistics hubs, manufacturing zones, and retail chains in contiguity helps speed iteration and aligns development with the continent’s actual operational pain points. McKinsey estimates that in some of Europe’s critical sectors — including retail and logistics — payroll alone amounts to $1.7 trillion (€1.55 trillion). This makes automation highly profitable and ripe for disruption.\n\nThese factors have played a key role in the strategy of Humanoid, the robotics company I founded in the UK last year. Our goal isn’t just to impress on stage; it’s far more important that we seamlessly integrate innovations into real workflows. For this, we’ve adopted a simple, modular design philosophy: a wheeled base that suits logistics environments, accelerated by simulation plus feedback from real industry trials. We believe that hype must be based on reality — a mindset that’s drawing US investors to European robotics.\n\nThis shift is already reflected in funding dynamics. Neura Robotics’ €120mn funding round in January 2025 was one of the largest in European robotics to date. And investors are now betting on full-stack teams with credible deployment strategies — instead of merely speculative tech.\n\nHumanoid’s latest robot, HMND 01, was introduced in a video earlier this year. Credit: Humanoid\n\nA better fit for the future of work\n\nBeyond reducing uncertainty, European regulation also helps encode values that shape how humanoid robots are developed and deployed. The AI Act requires high-risk systems — including those used in workplaces, public spaces, and healthcare settings — to meet strict safety, transparency, and human oversight standards.\n\nSuch a framework fosters trust, which is essential for robots operating in sensitive environments like factories, hospitals, or elderly care facilities. Europe’s emphasis on traceability and ethical co-development goes beyond mitigating risk — it creates the conditions for adoption at scale, where safety and dignity are non-negotiable.\n\nAdditionally, this approach helps position robots as partners. By designing for augmentation rather than displacement — as often seen in the US — European startups are modelling a more human-centred approach to automation. They’re also offering an alternative to the dominant narrative that robots will replace humans in critical roles.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that some jobs aren’t meant for people, as they hinder individuals from reaching their full potential. For instance, a humanoid could take over the task of moving boxes around a warehouse all day. This is not simply a replacement; it is an augmentation of existing automation capabilities, which empowers people to find more purpose-driven work.\n\nThat distinction comes into sharper focus when we look at the places where humanoids are most needed, such as logistics hubs, clinics, and care homes. These environments have real spatial and regulatory constraints and little room for error. The tasks there are repetitive but require precision, and people are extremely busy. In these settings, robots need to quietly support the flow of work, not interrupt it. That requires thoughtful integration, which means responding at the right pace, handling objects predictably, and, yes, staying out of the way when needed.\n\nThese are practical challenges shaped by day-to-day routines, not only engineering feats. And, from our vantage point, Europe’s cautious, user-informed development model is well-suited to meet them.\n\nSupply chains and strategic independence\n\nThere are still concerns in European robotics that need to be addressed. As of 2025, China controls 63% of the humanoid hardware supply chain, from rare-earth magnets to key actuators. However, we’re now seeing global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) based in Europe partnering with humanoid creators early on to co-develop hardware components together. This strategy can mitigate the risk of over-dependence.\n\nOn the other hand, while the US dominates in AI software, few actors globally offer fully-integrated stacks. We see some moves in that direction in the US and China, and Europe — which is still dependent on imports — must learn to navigate this space assertively.\n\nCalls for supply diversification are growing. In June 2025, Benjamin Krieger, from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA), emphasised the need for stronger EU supply chain routes due to China’s export controls on rare-earth elements. In the US, analysts are sounding similar alarms.\n\nTo reduce dependency, Europe will need to support local manufacturing of key components, incentivise alternative sourcing, and form trade alliances outside Beijing’s orbit.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe next phase of humanoid robotics will not be won by whoever moves fastest. It will be won by whoever builds best.\n\nWhat will this require? To start, bolstering funding and support mechanisms that help innovations advance through the later stages of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale — and move from pilots to industrial-grade rollouts. Second, forging industrial partnerships that begin during prototyping, not after. Third, policy agility to fast-track certification while maintaining the highest safety standards.\n\nWhat’s at stake isn’t just who secures the most patents — we’ve already seen that happen without meaningful real-world deployment. The true challenge is whether we can build systems that integrate safely into human environments, uphold public trust, and address the real concerns people have — from privacy and transparency to everyday safety and interaction.\n\nEurope doesn’t need to mimic Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Instead, it needs to double down on what it already does well: interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical tech design, and industrial pragmatism.\n\nThe global humanoid race is not a sprint — it’s a long-term infrastructure project. And if we get it right, Europe could build the future’s most trusted workforce —- one that collaborates with humans and changes the world, one robot at a time.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"need\", \"robots\", \"ai\", \"europe\", \"race\", \"european\", \"safety\", \"europes\", \"robotics\", \"eu\", \"humanoid\", \"win\", \"quietly\"]", "content_hash": "8029ef43a1e99617e17b64c4dd64eba16fadbfd6d11ad701563f5949b3ab9754", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:23.624794+00:00"}

The Data Protection Act, the GDPR, and the recent AI Act — aligned more closely with local workers’ laws and unions — have set the continent on a separate path.\n\nA recent joint study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Poland’s National Research Institute (NASK) found that Europe — along with Asia — tops the list of most exposed regions to AI, far surpassing the Americas. With studies finding that one in four jobs are at risk of being transformed by AI globally, the impact in Europe — a region which faces a significant shortage of skilled workers — has become a pressing concern.\n\n“In many ways, it’s too early to tell where the AI wave will take us — we’ve only seen a fraction of its capabilities so far, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying,” Adam Maurer, COO at Connecting Software, a tech company operating across Europe, told TNW.\n\nIn recent years, Big Tech companies have frequently carried out mass layoffs, driven both by revenue concerns and the belief that AI can take over many of the functions of employees from entry to mid-level, Maurer said.\n\nSome of these AI-driven layoffs have effectively targeted low performers, but other initiatives have been problematic. At Klarna, for example, they had concerning impacts on the business.\n\nKlarna, a Swedish fintech company that fired 700 workers and replaced them with AI, recently announced it will hire humans back again. The company’s CEO admitted to having made a “mistake” when replacing workers with AI.\n\n“It’s very clear that AI will definitely replace some jobs,” Maurer said. “On the other side of the coin, I think it will make some other jobs far more valuable.”\n\nIn the EU, labour laws and regulations will shape the impact on jobs. Tech leaders believe they could lead to an AI future that benefits both workers and businesses.\n\nThe talk among executives\n\nMaurer said there may be some expectation for the EU to step in and regulate job displacement. However, he argued that would stagnate growth and discourage startups from doing business in the union.\n\nBut not every business leader agrees. Displacement will happen, but not because of AI, said Volodymyr Kubytskyi, head of AI at MacPaw, a Ukrainian software company developing solutions for Apple devices.\n\n“AI disrupts the traditional logic and processes of work,” Kubytskyi told TNW. “The real question is, ‘Can we redesign work processes before this outdated system collapses?’” To prevent the system from collapsing, leaders must stop thinking of AI as a quick-win or cost-saving tool, he said.\n\nKubytskyi argued that while the AI Act was necessary to set a baseline for the industry, it doesn’t account for potential job disruption, which is a gap in the regulatory landscape.\n\n“To account for this, the AI Act should be updated, but it’s unlikely that this will happen soon,” he said.\n\nRoman Eloshvili, founder of ComplyControl, a UK compliance company, told TNW that the AI Act targets safety, transparency, and ethics, but falls short on socio-economic impact, especially on jobs. “So, amendments are necessary,” he said.\n\n“I expect that, over time, some of them, such as mandates for employer-led upskilling or protections for displaced workers, will appear to address workforce implications more effectively.”\n\nWill the AI Act become outdated or even counterproductive, especially if its stringent compliance mechanisms amplify inequalities in access to AI benefits? Or is it too early in the game to amend the law?\n\nKris Jones, who leads the engineering team in Belfast for iVerify, believes it’s too soon to make changes. He said the AI Act’s risk-based framework already strikes a delicate balance between protecting fundamental rights and giving innovators room to breathe.\n\nAmending the regulation is not the only policy idea discussed among executives. Jones told TNW that member states have other levers to pull. “One idea floating around is an ‘AI token’ tax,” he said.\n\nA token tax would enable governments to generate revenue from AI usage that is producing income. These funds would then be redistributed through measures such as reskilling programs or support for affected industries.\n\nDario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, recently told Axios that the concept could offset the inevitable wipeout of millions of entry-level white-collar jobs lost to AI.\n\n“Measures like that can cushion any job shocks without putting a blanket lid on innovation,” Amodei said.\n\nAre clashes with European labour and trade unions inevitable?\n\nEuropean labour and trade union bodies have often been ignored in the debate over AI job displacement. But many of them have already made official statements expressing concerns over AI.\n\nAhead of the Paris AI Summit in February 2025, the ETUC, representing over 45 million European workers, issued an open letter about AI’s dangers. It warned that any efforts to ensure AI has “a positive impact on workers in the labour markets, quality jobs, and society will be annulled if AI is monopolised by a handful of tech companies”.\n\nThe previous August, UK unions, including Accord and Unite, had called for regulations to protect workers from AI. They also proposed reskilling programs for workers, reminded companies of their transparency obligations, and emphasised the need for union consultations. They said that they intended to protect workers’ rights against AI‑driven hiring and firing, as well as defend IP rights for creative professionals.\n\nWe asked tech firms whether they expect companies to face challenges with labour laws and unions in Europe.\n\n“Undoubtedly,” Eloshvili from ComplyControl said. “European robust worker protections and active unions present both a safeguard and challenges for AI integration.”\n\nUnions will demand transparency and worker involvement in AI deployment as automation threatens certain jobs, he said. “Firms that try to impose AI solutions without dialogue definitely risk conflict and backlash.”\n\nDespite the challenges, Eloshvili said it isn’t a zero-sum game. “When businesses and unions work together — for example, under joint upskilling initiatives — AI can become an effective tool for improving working conditions,” he said.\n\nKubytskyi from MacPaw agreed that challenges will arise on this front and described the pushback from unions and workers’ organisations as “understandable”.\n\n“Clarity, structure, and communication are vital,” he said. “If you integrate new [AI] agents into existing workflows without involving people, you’ll get pushback, and for a good reason.”\n\nKubytskyi also believes that conflict can be avoided. “To prevent this, we need to show people what AI does, what guardrails are in place, and why it will benefit the team.”\n\nJorge Riera, the CEO of big data and AI consultancy Dataco, agrees. “The most effective AI deployments are strategic,” he said, adding that careful analysis is needed to decipher which work tasks should be offloaded to AI.\n\nFlipping the script to develop AI the ‘European way’\n\nJones from iVerify explained that regulations, trade unions, and workers’ rights in Europe are not necessarily an obstacle and could, in fact, be beneficial.\n\nHe believes companies should embed responsible AI, bias checks, explainability, and human oversight loops into each product cycle. That way, they can transform the AI Act from a compliance hurdle into a market differentiator, Jones explained.\n\n“Europe can’t sit out the AI wave; the Bay Area now fields roughly half of the world’s unicorns and hoovers up 80% of GenAI funding, while much of the European workforce is ageing and a quarter of young Europeans can’t find work,” Jones said.\n\nEurope is not only facing competition from the usual suspects — Asia and the US — but also from Latin America, where heavy investment in technology is underway.\n\nMahesh Raja, chief growth officer of Ness Digital Engineering, which operates innovation centres in the UK and Czechia, highlighted how this lack of similar investment is hurting business. “Fifty-three percent of small- and medium-size businesses found the initial cost of AI implementation to be much higher than anticipated. We need to address the adoption challenges that stem from legacy IT infrastructures and improve the collective time-to-value for this emerging technology,” he said.\n\nHowever, Europe’s stringent regulations can become a premium brand for banks, healthtechs, and any sector that values trust and data privacy.\n\n”Europe shouldn’t just photocopy Silicon Valley,” Jones said. He believes the continent’s strengths lie in a combination of factors, including upskilling and STEM PhD graduates per capita. The privacy-first and safe AI leadership — solidified in regulation — can bolster the package.\n\n“Overall, Europe should push hard on AI augmentation and skill-building, or we’ll fall further behind,” Jones said. “But do it Europe’s way, leveraging our ethical governance, deep industrial know-how, and cross-border talent pipelines instead of importing the Valley’s blitz-and-break culture wholesale.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"work\", \"act\", \"ai\", \"workers\", \"europe\", \"stifling\", \"unions\", \"jobs\", \"told\", \"protect\", \"eus\", \"labour\", \"jones\", \"innovation\"]", "content_hash": "d5d63c25b67f85daae93803735f2880db3af5f7910d11a2d0bcb679009816f51", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:24.219917+00:00"}

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "The Oura Ring 4 (left) has receded sensors that make it more comfortable compared to Oura Ring 3 (right). Nina Raemont/ZDNET\n\nConsidering buying an Oura Ring to track your sleep, activity, or stress? Oura is taking up to $200 off its third-gen smart ring, depending on the finish and size. This deal applies to the Oura Ring Heritage and Oura Ring Horizon, two third-generation smart rings.\n\nAlso: The Oura Ring 4 is ZDNET's best product of the year\n\nThe deal on the earlier generation Oura Ring 3 is so low because Oura recently unveiled the Oura Ring 4. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive and well-designed smart ring that blows its competitors (and even the Ring 3) out of the water. But does that mean you should buy the newer Ring 4 over the less expensive Ring 3 that's on sale right now? It all depends on what features you prioritize in a smart ring. I break down the differences below.\n\nSpecifications\n\n\n\nOura Ring 3 Oura Ring 4 Battery life Up to seven days Up to eight days Charging time Between 20-80 minutes Between 20-80 minutes Sizes 6-13 4-15 Material Titanium exterior and epoxy interior Fully titanium Finishes Black, brushed titanium, gold, silver, rose gold Black, brushed silver, gold, silver, rose gold Starting price $300 $350\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 4 if...\n\n\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You prioritize comfort\n\nOne of the highlights of the new Oura Ring 4 is its smart sensors. Oura Ring 4's smart sensing technology uses 18 signal pathways, compared to the Oura Ring 3's eight, to capture more accurate data with fewer gaps.\n\nSo, what does that have to do with comfort? These smart sensors allow the raised sensor domes that stick out on the Oura Ring 3's interior to flatten and recede on the Oura Ring 4 for a more comfortable and less constrictive wear. I wore the Oura Ring 3 for around eight months, and one of the few gripes I had with it was that the three domes would cling to the inside of my finger, resulting in dents that remained on my skin for days after.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 4 for weeks. Here's why it's the best health tracker right now\n\nThe Oura Ring 4 is far more comfortable than the Oura Ring 3 thanks to the receded smart sensing technology. It's noticeably slimmer, both on the interior of the ring and the exterior, which results in a lighter feel. If you are more sensitive to health trackers around your wrist or finger and get easily annoyed with jewelry, I'd suggest the Oura Ring 4.\n\n2. You want a smaller or larger ring size\n\nSherin Shibu\n\nExpanded sizing is one of the major hardware upgrades that came with the Oura Ring 4. Where the Oura Ring 3 offers sizes six through 13, the Oura Ring 4 offers sizes four through 15. That's four more sizes on the larger and smaller ends of the spectrum. If you couldn't buy the Oura Ring 3 because the available sizes didn't fit your finger, the Oura Ring 4 might fit you better.\n\n3. You want a longer battery life\n\nThe Oura Ring 3 boasts a battery life of up to seven days, though I normally got around four. The newer Oura Ring 4 boasts a battery life of up to eight days, but during my testing I got around 5 and a half.\n\nIf you forget to charge your tech constantly and want a smart ring that you can put on for a few days and not worry about, then I'd recommend the Oura Ring 4. If you are adamant about daily charging, however, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3.\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 3 if...\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You just want the newest software\n\nMost of the software updates that came to the Oura Ring 4 also are available on the Oura Ring 3. That includes automatic heart rate monitoring during workouts, the Oura app redesign, upgraded daytime stress features that help contextualize your physiological stress, and many new Oura Labs features you can test out, like meal logging.\n\nAutomatic heart rate monitoring continues Oura's mission of autonomously logging health data with little assistance from the ring wearer. This means that, on top of the automatic workout detection feature, the Oura Ring now can monitor and record your heart rate during these activities without you clicking on the Record workout HR button.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 3 -- and it totally beat my Apple Watch\n\nOura upgraded its daytime stress feature by implementing the daily tags people use to document their meals, workouts, illnesses, and moods onto the daytime stress timeline. Let's say you just had an argument with a coworker and find that your heart rate is elevated. If you log that in the app, it will include that tag into the daytime stress timeline.\n\nLastly, there are a few experimental features Oura Ring 3 users can take advantage of through Oura Labs, which is also available on both rings. One of my favorite features I tested was the meal-logging feature that uses your camera and AI to document what you're eating (and when).\n\nThe AI was able to detect that I was eating yogurt with berries and bananas one morning, despite the yogurt being fully picked over and mixed with the other ingredients.\n\n2. You don't want to spend more money\n\nYou can buy an Oura Ring 3 for up to $200 right now. The third-generation smart ring has been on sale since Oura unveiled a newer generation. If a starting price of $350 (plus that $6 monthly subscription to access all your data) is a little too much for you, the Oura Ring 3 is substantially cheaper.\n\n3. Comfort isn't a concern\n\nIf you own an Oura Ring 3 and aren't disturbed by the raised sensors or the chunkier build, I don't see a need for you to upgrade to the Oura Ring 4. If you don't own either ring and are trying to make a buying decision, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3 if you are unbothered by a tight and raised dome around your finger.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"stress\", \"older\", \"newest\", \"features\", \"oura\", \"sensors\", \"ring\", \"days\", \"buy\", \"right\", \"discounted\", \"sizes\", \"vs\", \"opt\", \"smart\"]", "content_hash": "8bfe6d67475ef7abdc53eeb95171bbca33677b332ccb0bbadccb85f08b2f9891", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:30.155315+00:00"}

Pt\", \"Elyse Betters Picaro\"]", "published": null, "text": "Maria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nIf you've heard about Alexa+, a revamped version of Amazon's virtual assistant powered by generative AI, you may be interested in diving into the Amazon Alexa ecosystem. Amazon Echo speakers are the best way to bring Alexa into your smart home. The Echo Pop and Echo Dot, Amazon's two most compact smart speakers, are the most popular and affordable Echo devices available.\n\nAmazon's new Alexa+ is launching gradually over the next few weeks. While the company is prioritizing the larger Echo Shows in the initial release, Amazon says that after you get access to Alexa+ on an Echo Show 8,10,15, or 21, it will be available on all of your Echo devices, with the exception of some older generations.\n\nAlso: Amazon just gave Alexa its biggest upgrade in a decade - and old Echo devices will support it\n\nThe Echo Pop is newer than the Echo Dot and is marketed as the company's most compact speaker. At about two-thirds of the size of the already compact Echo Dot, the Echo Pop is best suited for small rooms and can be tucked away in the corner of a desk. The slightly larger Echo Dot is about the size of an Apple HomePod mini and delivers more potent sound.\n\nRead on to learn more about how the Echo Pop and Echo Dot compare and which is best suited for which sort of user.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Pop if...\n\n\n\nHere's an Amazon Echo Pop next to an Apple Magic Mouse, for reference. Maria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need a compact speaker\n\nThe Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and most affordable smart speaker, perfect for a small room -- such as a dorm or a kid's room. Because it doesn't feature a screen and can go unnoticed, it's a simple way to introduce yourself to the Alexa ecosystem or give someone access to Amazon's voice assistant in a simple, unintimidating way.\n\nReview: Amazon Echo Pop review: A portable smart speaker for small spaces\n\nThe Echo Pop is a perfect option if you're looking for a compact speaker for your kid's desk, a guest room, or an area you don't use often. It can be unreliable in larger rooms or when tasked with bigger assignments, which brings me to my next point.\n\n2. You plan on everyday music streaming, podcasts, or audiobooks\n\nThe Echo Pop is surprisingly loud, but the sound quality decreases greatly when the volume increases. This is why the Echo Pop is meant for smaller rooms and is much less expensive than other Echo devices.\n\nAlso: The best smart home devices\n\nThe Echo Pop won't be the life of the party at a backyard barbecue. Still, it's excellent for listening to music informally when hanging out in your room, catching up on your favorite podcasts, and listening to audiobooks. Having Alexa built-in makes it more enticing, as you can use the AI-powered voice assistant to control smart devices around your home.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Dot if...\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need Alexa to be more reliable\n\nBecause the Echo Pop is a smaller, more affordable smart speaker than the Echo Dot, it's also less reliable. The Echo Dot is more responsive and can easily hear me from across the room, whether it's playing music or not.\n\nThe Echo Pop, in turn, appears to have a simpler microphone array that is easily overpowered by high volumes. I've often found Alexa unable to hear me on the Echo Pop when the volume is too high, which can be frustrating, especially because it doesn't have an action button.\n\nAlso: Here's how to use Alexa Plus for free - especially if you're an Amazon Prime member\n\nThe Echo Dot features a volume-up button, a volume-down button, a mute button, and an action button. The last one is a great way to wake Alexa without talking to it, which would be nice in the Echo Pop when it can't hear me. I've resorted to unplugging the Echo Pop when it can't hear me, so it stops blasting \"The Wheels on the Bus.\"\n\n2. You want room-filling sound\n\nThe Echo Dot isn't a high-end speaker, but it is great for most users. It can deliver room-filling sound from a small package, as the audio doesn't deteriorate as much as the Echo Pop's when the volume goes up. For example, you can pair two Echo Dots to function as external speakers for a TV and get stereo sound better than audio from most inexpensive TVs.\n\nAlso: Not all Echo devices will get Alexa Plus - see if yours made the list\n\nAs a device often discounted during Prime Day and holiday sales events for around half off, I'd recommend the Echo Dot to most users looking for a reliable smart speaker with Alexa built-in that can deliver sound from all directions.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"choose\", \"devices\", \"echo\", \"compact\", \"smart\", \"alexa\", \"amazon\", \"room\", \"speaker\", \"vs\", \"pop\", \"dot\"]", "content_hash": "98bade5b9872cfa69029fa4b6b1d966decd58db1114183116401f58f5ba92fcd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:30.974619+00:00"}

You can instantly sign up for its free plan and build your first campaign. With step-by-step buttons on its dashboard, like importing or creating your contact list, connecting an integration, and importing your brand persona, your first round of emails or SMS campaign will be ready in no time.\n\nHere, you can either start from scratch or use a campaign template. The drag-and-drop editor makes the entire setup process easy, though the free templates are pretty barebones unless you upgrade. The automation builder can trigger emails based on sign-ups, tags, events, or custom criteria you set. I tested both prebuilt and custom journeys, and while it takes a few minutes to learn the flow, it's flexible and powerful once you do. That said, Classic Automations were discontinued in mid-2025 by Mailchimp, so if you're coming back to the platform after a while, expect to rebuild from scratch and pay for something that used to be free.\n\nMoreover, Mailchimp's dashboard actually recommends flows based on common goals like welcoming new contacts, sharing content with Meta leads, or sending birthday discounts. These flows save serious time for basic tasks like recovering abandoned carts or nurturing repeat buyers. The thing is, on the Free plan, you can preview them, but you'll need to upgrade to actually launch them. Still, it's nice to see what's possible before committing. Setting up a flow is visual, i.e., more drag-and-drop than techy, which makes it approachable, even if you've never done automation before. Once you understand how triggers and actions work together, you can build out surprisingly complex sequences.\n\nPlans start free with 500 contacts, then scale based on list size. Paid plans include Essentials (from $13 per month), Standard (from $20 per month), and Premium (from $350 per month for 10,000+ contacts). So, if you're working with a small list, the Free or Essentials plan might be enough. You can also buy credits with a Pay As You Go plan if you send your emails occasionally. Free trials run for 14 days on Standard or Essentials, and nonprofits get a 15% discount.\n\nMailchimp features: Email + SMS campaign builder | Prebuilt automation flows | List segmentation and tagging | Signup forms and popups | Landing page builder | 250+ integrations | 14-day free trial on paid plans", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"month\", \"free\", \"plan\", \"marketing\", \"essentials\", \"emails\", \"best\", \"email\", \"tested\", \"expert\", \"2025\", \"list\", \"flows\", \"software\", \"campaign\", \"youre\", \"contacts\"]", "content_hash": "3f9534ef5783a27d268bc1180bba5d84680da8a9970ecfba8c966f7fff4ad487", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:32.322541+00:00"}

Features available from the outset include account, contact, task, and lead management.

Recently, Salesforce launched a new solution to improve AI agents used to help human productivity. Who it's for: Businesses of any size, large or small. I like the simple nature of Salesforce plans, with one option for small and midsize businesses and another for enterprises, priced at $25 and $100 per user per month, respectively. Who should look elsewhere: Many Salesforce Starter CRM customers are impressed with the services offered, though some note the high price for enterprise users. Some features, including advanced automation and access to AppExchange -- the Salesforce app marketplace -- are limited to premium subscribers. There also isn't a middle ground plan between the Starter and Pro Suites, and this might deter some people. Microsoft Dynamics CRM could be a great alternative.

Though the overall classifications of different types of CRM software vary from vendor to vendor, the same themes appear. You may want to research the major types of CRM before you make a purchase decision, as that may influence how your business grows. Operational: Most modern CRM platforms offer some kind of operational mechanism or module. Operational CRMs tend to focus on optimizing business operations, including sales processes, logistics, and customer communications. Operational CRMs may be particularly useful for startups and small and midsize businesses looking to scale. Analytical/data-driven: Other CRMs focus on the intrinsic value of data. Businesses able to handle, securely store, and analyze customer data -- always useful if held in a centralized, organized platform -- can draw insights and see patterns that may influence their future sales activities or reveal new revenue streams. Furthermore, data-driven CRMs may reveal ways to improve customer relationships and retention. Collaborative: Collaborative CRMs provide organizations with a way to enhance collaboration and productivity. CRM suites can be used to create department channels and data repositories, allowing different teams to work together and to share information. For instance, a sales team could collaborate with marketing and finance to create new customer promotions and campaigns. Customer service teams, too, can access important records to track customer journeys and resolve issues.

The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.\n\nCato Networks’ researcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren’t isolated occurrences, and that Russia’s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.\n\nMost startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nThe rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report reveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato’s researchers observe in the report, “most notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.”\n\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfare\n\nResearchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face’s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model.\n\nThe legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (Додаток.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background. This official-looking PDF about cybersecurity measures from the Security Service of Ukraine serves as a decoy while the malware performs its reconnaissance operations. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\nAPT28’s approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of “curly naked women” as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.\n\nThe provocative image generation prompts used by APT28’s image.py variant, including ‘Curvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face’, are designed to occupy victims’ attention during document theft. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\n\n“Russia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,” explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. “This is the first in the wild that was captured.”\n\nA quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malware\n\nSimonovich’s Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28’s deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls “Immersive World,” he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.\n\nThe method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.\n\n“I slowly walked him throughout my goal,” Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. “First, ‘Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.’ Then, ‘Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'”\n\nSix hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.\n\nWelcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy\n\nDuring his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.\n\nTo explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.\n\nAnother platform, Nytheon AI, revealed even less operational security. “I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn’t care about OpSec,” Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: “Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.”\n\nThese aren’t proof-of-concepts. They’re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer “Claude Code” clones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.\n\nEnterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surface\n\nCato Networks’ recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren’t pilot programs; they’re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn’t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.\n\nSimonovich told VentureBeat that vendors’ responses to Cato’s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world’s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.\n\nWhen Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:\n\nDeepSeek never responded\n\nGoogle declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples\n\nMicrosoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work\n\nOpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn’t engage further\n\nSix Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack\n\nAPT28’s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn’t a warning; it’s proof that Simonovich’s research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.\n\nThe metrics are stark—270 stolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms offer identical capabilities for $250 per month. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.\n\nEnterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per Cato’s 2025 CTRL Threat Report. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.\n\nSimonovich’s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it’s an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.\n\nToday’s adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity. The weapons are already inside every organization, and today they’re called productivity tools.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"threat\", \"defense\", \"ai\", \"actor\", \"malware\", \"simonovich\", \"ukraine\", \"enterprise\", \"lamehug\", \"venturebeat\", \"perimeter\", \"security\", \"end\", \"tools\", \"cato\"]", "content_hash": "245600ead84199e16252d0bd2b99aff8fb1291969309474c3d19c7ef34b0a34f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:36.040084+00:00"}

LFM2-VL-1.6B — a more capable model that remains lightweight enough for single-GPU and device-based deployment.\n\nBoth variants process images at native resolutions up to 512×512 pixels, avoiding distortion or unnecessary upscaling.\n\nFor larger images, the system applies non-overlapping patching and adds a thumbnail for global context, enabling the model to capture both fine detail and the broader scene.\n\nBackground on Liquid AI\n\nLiquid AI was founded by former researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) with the goal of building AI architectures that move beyond the widely used transformer model.\n\nThe company’s flagship innovation, the Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs), are based on principles from dynamical systems, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra, producing general-purpose AI models capable of handling text, video, audio, time series, and other sequential data.\n\nUnlike traditional architectures, Liquid’s approach aims to deliver competitive or superior performance using significantly fewer computational resources, allowing for real-time adaptability during inference while maintaining low memory requirements. This makes LFMs well suited for both large-scale enterprise use cases and resource-limited edge deployments.\n\nIn July 2025, the company expanded its platform strategy with the launch of the Liquid Edge AI Platform (LEAP), a cross-platform SDK designed to make it easier for developers to run small language models directly on mobile and embedded devices.\n\nLEAP offers OS-agnostic support for iOS and Android, integration with both Liquid’s own models and other open-source SLMs, and a built-in library with models as small as 300MB—small enough for modern phones with minimal RAM.\n\nIts companion app, Apollo, enables developers to test models entirely offline, aligning with Liquid AI’s emphasis on privacy-preserving, low-latency AI. Together, LEAP and Apollo reflect the company’s commitment to decentralizing AI execution, reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure, and empowering developers to build optimized, task-specific models for real-world environments.\n\nSpeed/quality trade-offs and technical design\n\nLFM2-VL uses a modular architecture combining a language model backbone, a SigLIP2 NaFlex vision encoder, and a multimodal projector.\n\nThe projector includes a two-layer MLP connector with pixel unshuffle, reducing the number of image tokens and improving throughput.\n\nUsers can adjust parameters such as the maximum number of image tokens or patches, allowing them to balance speed and quality depending on the deployment scenario. The training process involved approximately 100 billion multimodal tokens, sourced from open datasets and in-house synthetic data.\n\nPerformance and benchmarks\n\nThe models achieve competitive benchmark results across a range of vision-language evaluations. LFM2-VL-1.6B scores well in RealWorldQA (65.23), InfoVQA (58.68), and OCRBench (742), and maintains solid results in multimodal reasoning tasks.\n\nIn inference testing, LFM2-VL achieved the fastest GPU processing times in its class when tested on a standard workload of a 1024×1024 image and short prompt.\n\nLicensing and availability\n\nLFM2-VL models are available now on Hugging Face, along with example fine-tuning code in Colab. They are compatible with Hugging Face transformers and TRL.\n\nThe models are released under a custom “LFM1.0 license”. Liquid AI has described this license as based on Apache 2.0 principles, but the full text has not yet been published.\n\nThe company has indicated that commercial use will be permitted under certain conditions, with different terms for companies above and below $10 million in annual revenue.\n\nWith LFM2-VL, Liquid AI aims to make high-performance multimodal AI more accessible for on-device and resource-limited deployments, without sacrificing capability.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"model\", \"ai\", \"wants\", \"competitive\", \"lfm2vl\", \"fast\", \"liquid\", \"multimodal\", \"smartphones\", \"image\", \"visionlanguage\", \"models\", \"small\", \"inference\"]", "content_hash": "2e837152b6d2cd363330786e2515f04d06676e6aefc24fa8ca94b2c1b52286af", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:36.645675+00:00"}

We will first make sure that current paying ChatGPT users get more total usage than they did before GPT-5.\n\n\n\n2. We will then prioritize API demand up to the… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 12, 2025\n\nHe said the company’s first priority is ensuring that current paying ChatGPT users receive more total usage than they had before GPT-5’s release, though he did not provide specific figures for the increase.\n\nHowever, Altman previously posted on X that OpenAI was “trying” a 3,000 messages-per-week usage limit when using the GPT-5 “thinking” mode, more reasoning power and time spent reasoning on harder problems, for ChatGPT Plus subscribers (the $20 per month plan).\n\ntrying 3000 per week now! — Sam Altman (@sama) August 10, 2025\n\nInterestingly, one report from an AI app creator on X said that OpenAI told him the usage limits for GPT-5 plus thinking on the ChatGPT Team plan ($30 per user per month) is much lower than that of ChatGPT Plus users, only 200 “Thinking” messages per week when selected manually by the user.\n\nOpenAI just replied to me with an email about the GPT-5 usage limits under the Team plan：\n\n\n\n· ChatGPT Team can manually select GPT-5-Thinking\n\n\n\n· Manual usage cap: 200 messages/week\n\n\n\n· On reaching cap: popup alert, GPT-5-Thinking hidden from menu — Vic Zhang (@RealVicHere) August 12, 2025\n\nOpenAI’s availability of GPT-5 through its application programming interface (API) for third-party developers is also being tweaked.\n\nAltman also stated in his X post that OpenAI would “prioritize API demand up to the currently allocated capacity and commitments we’ve made to customers.”\n\nIn other words, existing API users and those already in contract will get the first dibs on GPT-5 access through OpenAI’s API, others may have to wait longer.\n\nAltman also clarified “we can support about an additional ~30% new API growth from where we are today with this capacity,” meaning they can take on more API users, but not too many.\n\nWhile OpenAI hasn’t definitively shared how many users of its API there are in some time, the company did say it has “5 million” businesses paying for access to ChatGPT.\n\nAltman also said OpenAI plans to roughly double its compute fleet over the next five months. He did not specify the current size or type of infrastructure involved, but indicated the expansion should ease capacity constraints and improve performance for both ChatGPT and API users.\n\nI’ve reached out to OpenAI to ask for more specifics on the above numbers — 30% API growth up from what? doubling the compute fleet up from what? — and will update when I hear back.\n\nNew options for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users to search across Microsoft Teams and more…\n\nAlso last night, OpenAI updated its ChatGPT release notes online to allow subscribers of ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) to connect the application to search for files and projects across their third-party accounts on Box, Canva, Dropbox, HubSpot, Notion, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams.\n\nAnd just a few moments ago, OpenAI again updated the service to allow connections for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts to Pro users first, followed by Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plans.\n\nFor example, ChatGPT users can search their Gmail for all emails matching a certain query, Dropbox account or Notion workspace during a conversation without toggling over into those separate apps.\n\nIn addition, subscribers to the ChatGPT Pro tier ($200 per month) may now link their accounts to Microsoft Teams and GitHub connectors and search those third-party applications.\n\nThese join OpenAI’s previous connectors to Gmail, Google Drive and Google Calendar, among other apps.\n\nThe individual user/account holder first needs to manually connect these external accounts to ChatGPT.\n\nTo do so, they’ll need to:\n\nClick on their account name in the lower left corner of the web interface Click “Settings” from the pop up menu and then… Click “Connectors from the left sidebar menu. This should pull up a gallery view of available external apps and icons. Screenshots below.\n\nUnfortunately, these connectors are not available for Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe new connectors are currently in beta and disabled by default for Enterprise and Education plans, though administrators can enable them in settings.\n\nBalancing supply and demand\n\nBy combining capacity planning with new productivity integrations, OpenAI is positioning GPT-5 not only as a more powerful AI model but also as part of a more connected workspace.\n\nThe staged approach to compute allocation reflects the company’s effort to serve existing customers first while scaling up for future demand.\n\nAs the compute expansion comes online, paying users stand to benefit first from both higher availability and more ways to integrate ChatGPT into their daily workflows.\n\nBut first, OpenAI needs to stabilize its release and ensure GPT-5 is working smoothly for all the users who want it.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"api\", \"connectors\", \"teams\", \"tool\", \"clarifies\", \"openai\", \"gpt5\", \"dropbox\", \"pro\", \"plus\", \"compute\", \"usage\", \"users\", \"ms\", \"thirdparty\", \"chatgpt\", \"prioritization\"]", "content_hash": "00899e983f3f3a3a556b8fee19d88059e7bc6f78cac1d3dd78bdf898b13bcf1b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:37.440205+00:00"}

Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Roth Capital Partners are serving as joint placement agents and financial advisors.\n\nGIG HARBOR, Wash.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–August 12, 2025–\n\nHeritage Distilling Holding Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: CASK) (“Heritage” or the “Company”) today announced the pricing of a $220 million private placement offering ($100M in cash and $120M in $IP tokens) with support from Story Foundation and other leading investors, including a16z crypto, Amber Group, Arrington Capital, dao5, Hashed, Mirana Ventures, Neoclassic Capital, Open World, Polychain Capital, Selini Capital, Stix, Syncracy Capital and others, to support the launch of a first-of-its-kind $IP token digital asset treasury strategy.\n\nThis transaction represents a strategic milestone for Heritage, making it the first Nasdaq-listed company to adopt $IP as its primary reserve asset. $IP is the native token of Story, a blockchain that enables users to register their intellectual property onchain and add usage terms via smart contracts, thus allowing humans and AI agents the ability to transact in and monetize IP simply and easily. $IP is used to pay for transactions on Story, meaning that if more and more users take advantage of the network’s functionality, the token itself will become more valuable. $IP can also be used for yield-generating activities such as staking and validation. Heritage’s strategic investment in $IP reflects a broader shift in how public companies approach strategic reserves – not just as stores of value, but as vehicles for growth, yield, and long-term alignment with transformative technologies.\n\nThrough ecosystem apps like Aria and Ablo, Story has already supported the tokenization of hundreds of thousands of digital assets, powering collaborations with artists, brands, and intellectual property from world-renowned names including Justin Bieber, BTS, Blackpink, Adidas, and Crocs. In 2024, Story partnered with Stability AI to bring transparent licensing and compensation tracking to open-source model training pipelines. In Q3 2025, Grayscale also launched the Story Trust, providing institutional investors with regulated access to $IP through a traditional financial product. Poseidon, an AI-native incubation launched in July, extends Story’s infrastructure into the realm of decentralized training data, enabling rights-cleared datasets for physical AI like robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. Through its partnership with the foundation behind Web3’s first programmable, productive digital primitive designed for staking, licensing, and powering real-world AI workflows, Heritage gains early exposure to the tokenized IP economy while directly participating in its evolution.\n\nThis transaction is structured as a Private Investment in Public Equity (“PIPE”) offering involving a token exchange component. Heritage is expected to raise $100M via the sale of common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock. In addition, Heritage will issue shares of common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock in exchange for $IP tokens contributed from the Story Foundation at a fixed price of $3.40 per $IP token, helping to increase the number of tokens held in the Company’s treasury reserve on day one.\n\nStory Foundation selected Heritage as its first public partner to help grow the $IP ecosystem. In addition, key strategic partners will contribute additional $IP tokens to Heritage in exchange for common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock. At the close of the transaction, the Heritage treasury reserve is expected to receive and hold approximately 52.5 million $IP tokens with a market value of approximately $361 million (calculated based on the closing price of the $IP tokens of $6.8785 on August 10, 2025, as reported by CoinMarketCap.com).\n\nCantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Roth Capital Partners are serving as joint placement agents and financial advisors in the transaction. Open World, a premier U.S.-focused blockchain advisor, is advising Heritage and Story Foundation on structuring the digital asset treasury and will continue to serve as a strategic adviser to both.\n\nSeung Yoon “SY” Lee, CEO and Co-founder of PIP Labs, Chairman of Heritage Advisory Board and original creator of Story, said: “This is the perfect moment to be innovating at the intersection of crypto, AI, and Real World Asset tokenization. Now, with the proliferation of AI, it is our belief that $IP will be viewed as the new gold and has the potential to become increasingly valuable. Story Foundation’s net cash proceeds from its $IP token sale to Heritage as part of this transaction will be used to expand the network’s reach and support market $IP repurchases, reinforcing long-term ecosystem alignment.”\n\n“This transaction represents a bold leap forward, not just for Heritage, but for how public companies can participate in the digital asset economy,” said Justin Stiefel, CEO of Heritage. “For more than a decade we have been a leader in our industry, and because we know the value that intellectual property brings to creators and owners, we see $IP as a new category of strategic reserve to advance multiple pieces of the next decade of AI’s growth. As the first craft distiller in the U.S. to create a cryptocurrency treasury reserves policy, we are once again leading the way in this digital space.”\n\nAlso involved in this strategic transaction are respected crypto and tech leaders who have acted as advisors to the transaction and are expected to continue to advise Heritage to support the company’s strategic direction, bringing together deep expertise across capital markets, crypto, and AI:\n\nS.Y. Lee – Advisory Board Chairman (Founder and CEO of PIP Labs, original creator of Story)\n\nPhil Blows – Chief Investment Officer Appointee (Co-founder of -AQRU and B2 Capital Management)\n\nBen Sternberg – Strategic Finance Advisor (PIP Labs CFO, former CFO at Radish, Founder of Fexy Media)\n\nDavid Lee – Board Member Nominee (former Google Executive, former Chief Corporate Development Officer 451 Media)\n\nErick Zhang – Board Member Nominee (Founding Partner of Nomad Capital, former Head of Research at Binance, former CEO of CoinMarketCap)\n\nRavi Kaza – Special Advisor to the Board and Digital Assets Committee (CIO, Arrington Capital)\n\n“Story was built to turn intellectual property into an investable, programmable asset, and this reserve shows how we’re doing that at scale,” said Matt Shaw, Story Foundation Director. “Through this structure, public market investors can gain exposure to $IP via equity without navigating wallets or token infrastructure. In line with our commitment to ecosystem alignment, 100% of the Foundation’s net cash proceeds from this $IP token sale will be used to repurchase $IP in the open market within up to 90 days. This deal reflects responsible governance and strong partner alignment, while giving Heritage early positioning in one of crypto’s most exciting real-world asset classes.”\n\nThe PIPE transaction is expected to close on or about August 13th, 2025 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\nAbout Story\n\nBacked with $136 million from a16z crypto, Polychain, and Samsung Ventures, Story launched its mainnet in February 2025 and has rapidly become the leading blockchain infrastructure for tokenized intellectual property. Story is a blockchain purpose-built to make intellectual property a programmable digital asset with embedded rights.

Subscribe Now\n\nAnthropic announced Tuesday that its Claude Sonnet 4 artificial intelligence model can now process up to 1 million tokens of context in a single request — a fivefold increase that allows developers to analyze entire software projects or dozens of research papers without breaking them into smaller chunks.\n\nThe expansion, available now in public beta through Anthropic’s API and Amazon Bedrock, represents a significant leap in how AI assistants can handle complex, data-intensive tasks. With the new capacity, developers can load codebases containing more than 75,000 lines of code, enabling Claude to understand complete project architecture and suggest improvements across entire systems rather than individual files.\n\nThe announcement comes as Anthropic faces intensifying competition from OpenAI and Google, both of which already offer similar context windows. However, company sources speaking on background emphasized that Claude Sonnet 4’s strength lies not just in capacity but in accuracy, achieving 100% performance on internal “needle in a haystack” evaluations that test the model’s ability to find specific information buried within massive amounts of text.\n\nHow developers can now analyze entire codebases with AI in one request\n\nThe extended context capability addresses a fundamental limitation that has constrained AI-powered software development. Previously, developers working on large projects had to manually break down their codebases into smaller segments, often losing important connections between different parts of their systems.\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\n“What was once impossible is now reality,” said Sean Ward, CEO and co-founder of London-based iGent AI, whose Maestro platform transforms conversations into executable code, in a statement. “Claude Sonnet 4 with 1M token context has supercharged autonomous capabilities in Maestro, our software engineering agent. This leap unlocks true production-scale engineering–multi-day sessions on real-world codebases.”\n\nEric Simons, CEO of Bolt.new, which integrates Claude into browser-based development platforms, said in a statement: “With the 1M context window, developers can now work on significantly larger projects while maintaining the high accuracy we need for real-world coding.”\n\nThe expanded context enables three primary use cases that were previously difficult or impossible: comprehensive code analysis across entire repositories, document synthesis involving hundreds of files while maintaining awareness of relationships between them, and context-aware AI agents that can maintain coherence across hundreds of tool calls and complex workflows.\n\nWhy Claude’s new pricing strategy could reshape the AI development market\n\nAnthropic has adjusted its pricing structure to reflect the increased computational requirements of processing larger contexts. While prompts of 200,000 tokens or fewer maintain current pricing at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, larger prompts cost $6 and $22.50 respectively.\n\nThe pricing strategy reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry. Recent analysis shows that Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than OpenAI’s newly launched GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating pressure on enterprise procurement teams to balance performance against cost.\n\nHowever, Anthropic argues the decision should factor in quality and usage patterns rather than price alone. Company sources noted that prompt caching — which stores frequently accessed large datasets — can make long context cost-competitive with traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation approaches, especially for enterprises that repeatedly query the same information.\n\n“Large context lets Claude see everything and choose what’s relevant, often producing better answers than pre-filtered RAG results where you might miss important connections between documents,” an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat.\n\nAnthropic’s billion-dollar dependency on just two major coding customers\n\nThe long context capability arrives as Anthropic commands 42% of the AI code generation market, more than double OpenAI’s 21% share according to a Menlo Ventures survey of 150 enterprise technical leaders. However, this dominance comes with risks: industry analysis suggests that coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot drive approximately $1.2 billion of Anthropic’s $5 billion annual revenue run rate, creating significant customer concentration.\n\nThe GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. While GitHub Copilot currently relies on Claude for key functionality, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.\n\nThe timing of the context expansion is strategic. Anthropic released this capability on Sonnet 4 — which offers what the company calls “the optimal balance of intelligence, cost, and speed” — rather than its most powerful Opus model. Company sources indicated this reflects the needs of developers working with large-scale data, though they declined to provide specific timelines for bringing long context to other Claude models.\n\nInside Claude’s breakthrough AI memory technology and emerging safety risks\n\nThe 1 million token context window represents significant technical advancement in AI memory and attention mechanisms. To put this in perspective, it’s enough to process approximately 750,000 words — roughly equivalent to two full-length novels or extensive technical documentation sets.\n\nAnthropic’s internal testing revealed perfect recall performance across diverse scenarios, a crucial capability as context windows expand. The company embedded specific information within massive text volumes and tested Claude’s ability to find and use those details when answering questions.\n\nHowever, the expanded capabilities also raise safety considerations. Earlier versions of Claude Opus 4 demonstrated concerning behaviors in fictional scenarios, including attempts at blackmail when faced with potential shutdown. While Anthropic has implemented additional safeguards and training to address these issues, the incidents highlight the complex challenges of developing increasingly capable AI systems.\n\nFortune 500 companies rush to adopt Claude’s expanded context capabilities\n\nThe feature rollout is initially limited to Anthropic API customers with Tier 4 and custom rate limits, with broader availability planned over coming weeks. Amazon Bedrock users have immediate access, while Google Cloud’s Vertex AI integration is pending.\n\nEarly enterprise response has been enthusiastic, according to company sources. Use cases span from coding teams analyzing entire repositories to financial services firms processing comprehensive transaction datasets to legal startups conducting contract analysis that previously required manual document segmentation.\n\n“This is one of our most requested features from API customers,” an Anthropic spokesperson said. “We’re seeing excitement across industries that unlocks true agentic capabilities, with customers now running multi-day coding sessions on real-world codebases that would have been impossible with context limitations before.”\n\nThe development also enables more sophisticated AI agents that can maintain context across complex, multi-step workflows. This capability becomes particularly valuable as enterprises move beyond simple AI chat interfaces toward autonomous systems that can handle extended tasks with minimal human intervention.\n\nThe long context announcement intensifies competition among leading AI providers. Google’s older Gemini 1.5 Pro model and OpenAI’s older GPT-4.1 model both offer 1 million token windows, but Anthropic argues that Claude’s superior performance on coding and reasoning tasks provides competitive advantage even at higher prices.\n\nThe broader AI industry has seen explosive growth in model API spending, which doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months according to Menlo Ventures. Enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to newer models within weeks regardless of cost, suggesting that technical capabilities often outweigh pricing considerations in procurement decisions.\n\nHowever, OpenAI’s recent aggressive pricing strategy with GPT-5 could reshape these dynamics. Early comparisons show dramatic price advantages that may overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures as AI adoption scales.\n\nFor Anthropic, maintaining its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources remains critical. The company has tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.\n\nAs AI systems become capable of processing and reasoning about increasingly vast amounts of information, they’re fundamentally changing how developers approach complex software projects. The ability to maintain context across entire codebases represents a shift from AI as a coding assistant to AI as a comprehensive development partner that understands the full scope and interconnections of large-scale projects.\n\nThe implications extend far beyond software development. Industries from legal services to financial analysis are beginning to recognize that AI systems capable of maintaining context across hundreds of documents could transform how organizations process and understand complex information relationships.\n\nBut with great capability comes great responsibility—and risk. As these systems become more powerful, the incidents of concerning AI behavior during Anthropic’s testing serve as a reminder that the race to expand AI capabilities must be balanced with careful attention to safety and control.\n\nAs Claude learns to juggle a million pieces of information simultaneously, Anthropic faces its own context window problem: being trapped between OpenAI’s pricing pressure and Microsoft’s conflicting loyalties.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"claude\", \"coding\", \"software\", \"developers\", \"projects\", \"ai\", \"million\", \"process\", \"entire\", \"request\", \"company\", \"complex\", \"single\", \"anthropic\", \"pricing\", \"context\"]", "content_hash": "1461699fbf20af20c37137f5325b11bc9f163f8f28592d3ab09a27a1c8f52504", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:38.705316+00:00"}

It analyzes the user’s overall goal, breaks it down into subtasks, and assigns each subtask to the best agent for the job. It can delegate backend operations like file management or data processing to the Programmer, which writes and executes Python or Bash scripts.\n\nFor frontend tasks that require clicking buttons or navigating visual interfaces, it turns to the GUI Operator, a VLM-based agent.\n\n“This dynamic delegation allows CoAct-1 to strategically bypass inefficient GUI sequences in favor of robust, single-shot code execution where appropriate, while still leveraging visual interaction for tasks where it is indispensable,” the paper states.\n\nThe workflow is iterative. After the Programmer or GUI Operator completes a subtask, it sends a summary and a screenshot of the current system state back to the Orchestrator, which then decides the next step or concludes the task.\n\nThe Programmer agent uses an LLM to generate its code and sends commands to a code interpreter to test and refine its code over multiple rounds.\n\nSimilarly, the GUI Operator uses an action interpreter that executes its commands (e.g., mouse clicks, typing) and returns the resulting screenshot, allowing it to see the outcome of its actions. The Orchestrator makes the final decision on whether the task should continue or stop.\n\nExample of CoAct-1 in action (source: arXiv)\n\nA more efficient path to automation\n\nThe researchers tested CoAct-1 on OSWorld, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 369 real-world tasks across browsers, IDEs, and office applications.\n\nThe results show CoAct-1 establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving a success rate of 60.76%.\n\nThe performance gains were most significant in categories where programmatic control offers a clear advantage, such as OS-level tasks and multi-application workflows.\n\nFor instance, consider an OS-level task like finding all image files within a complex folder structure, resizing them, and then compressing the entire directory into a single archive.\n\nA purely GUI-based agent would need to perform a long, brittle sequence of clicks and drags, opening folders, selecting files, and navigating menus, with a high chance of error at each step.\n\nCoAct-1, by contrast, can delegate this entire workflow to its Programmer agent, which can accomplish the task with a single, robust script.\n\nBeyond just a higher success rate, the system is dramatically more efficient. CoAct-1 solves tasks in an average of just 10.15 steps, a stark contrast to the 15.22 steps required by leading GUI-only agents like GTA-1.\n\nWhile other agents like OpenAI’s CUA 4o averaged fewer steps, their overall success rate was much lower, indicating CoAct-1’s efficiency is coupled with greater effectiveness.\n\nThe researchers found a clear trend: tasks that require more actions are more likely to fail. Reducing the number of steps not only speeds up task completion but, more importantly, minimizes the opportunities for error.\n\nTherefore, finding ways to compress multiple GUI steps into a single programmatic task can make the process both more efficient and less error-prone.\n\nAs the researchers conclude, “This efficiency underscores the potential of our approach to pave a more robust and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.”\n\nCoAct-1 performs tasks with fewer steps on average thanks to smart use of coding (source: arXiv)\n\nFrom the lab to the enterprise workflow\n\nThe potential for this technology goes beyond general productivity. For enterprise leaders, the key lies in automating complex, multi-tool processes where full API access is a luxury, not a guarantee.\n\nRan Xu, a co-author of the paper and Director of Applied AI Research at Salesforce, points to customer support as a prime example.\n\n“A service support agent uses many different tools — general tools such as Salesforce, industry-specific tools such as EPIC for healthcare, and a lot of customized tools — to investigate a customer request and formulate a response,” Xu told VentureBeat. “Some of the tools have API access while others don’t. It is a perfect use case that could potentially benefit from our technology: a compute-use agent that leverages whatever is available from the computer, whether it’s an API, code, or just the screen.”\n\nXu also sees high-value applications in sales, such as prospecting at scale and automating bookkeeping, and in marketing for tasks like customer segmentation and campaign asset generation.\n\nNavigating real-world challenges and the need for human oversight\n\nWhile the results on the OSWorld benchmark are strong, enterprise environments are far messier, filled with legacy software and unpredictable UIs.\n\nThis raises critical questions about robustness, security, and the need for human oversight.\n\nA core challenge is ensuring the Orchestrator agent makes the right choice when faced with an unfamiliar application. According to Xu, the path to making agents like CoAct-1 robust for custom enterprise software involves training them with feedback in realistic, simulated environments.\n\nThe goal is to create a system where the “agent could observe how human agents work, get trained within a sandbox, and when it goes live, continue to solve tasks under the guidance and guardrail of a human agent.”\n\nThe ability for the Programmer agent to execute its own code also introduces obvious security concerns. What stops the agent from executing harmful code based on an ambiguous user request?\n\nXu confirms that robust containment is essential. “Access control and sandboxing is the key,” he said, emphasizing that a human must “understand the implication and give the AI access for safety.”\n\nSandboxing and guardrails will be critical to validating agent behavior before deployment on critical systems.\n\nUltimately, for the foreseeable future, overcoming ambiguity will likely require a human-in-the-loop. When asked about handling vague user queries, a concern also raised in the paper, Xu suggested a phased approach. “I see human-in-the-loop to start,” he noted.\n\nWhile some tasks may eventually become fully autonomous, for high-stakes operations, human validation will remain crucial. “Some mission-critical ones may always need human approval.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"tasks\", \"dont\", \"human\", \"system\", \"gui\", \"point\", \"faster\", \"task\", \"rates\", \"greater\", \"code\", \"agents\", \"success\", \"agent\", \"salesforces\", \"write\", \"steps\", \"coact1\"]", "content_hash": "a3a3ad3e18349a700676a469c381925d1da8fffce7bce81568c6b8c12c5c72b1", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:39.314765+00:00"}

Subscribe Now\n\nDespite being a highly regulated industry, equity trading has consistently been at the forefront of technological innovations in the financial services sector. However, when it comes to agents and AI applications, many banks have taken a more cautious approach to adoption.\n\nTD Securities, the equity and securities trading arm of TD Bank, rolled out its TD AI Virtual Assistant on July 8, aimed toward its front office institutional sales, trading and research professionals to help them manage their workflow.\n\nTD Securities CIO Dan Bosman told VentureBeat that the virtual assistant’s primary goal is to help front-office equity sales and traders gain client insights and research.\n\n“The first version of this began as a pilot, which we then subsequently scaled,” Bosman said. “It’s really about accessing that equity research data that our analysts put out and bringing it to the hands of the sales team in a way that’s sales-friendly.”\n\nAI Scaling Hits Its Limits Power caps, rising token costs, and inference delays are reshaping enterprise AI. Join our exclusive salon to discover how top teams are: Turning energy into a strategic advantage\n\nArchitecting efficient inference for real throughput gains\n\nUnlocking competitive ROI with sustainable AI systems Secure your spot to stay ahead: https://bit.ly/4mwGngO\n\nBosman noted that being around a trading floor means being exposed to a lot of the lingo, and the context in which users ask some questions feels very unique. So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders.\n\nBuilding TD AI\n\nBosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team. Fortunately, the bank has a platform called TD Invent, where employees can bring ideas and the innovation leadership team can evaluate projects responsibly.\n\n“Someone in our equity research sales desk came in and pretty much said, I’ve got this idea and brought it to TD Invent,” Bosman said. “What I’ve loved most about this is when you build something super magical, you don’t need to go out and sell or put a face on it. Folks come in and say to us, ‘we want this, we need this or we’ve got ideas,’ and it’s truly the best when we’re able to bring our investment in data, cloud and infrastructure together.”\n\nTD Security built the TD AI virtual assistant by leveraging OpenAI’s GPT models. Bosman said TD worked with its technology teams and the Canadian AI company Layer 6, which the bank acquired in 2018, as well as with other strategic partnerships. The assistant integrates with the bank’s cloud infrastructure, allowing it to access internal research documents and market data, such as 13F filings and historical equity data.\n\nBosman calls TDS AI a Knowledge Management System, a term that generally encompasses its ability to retrieve, through retrieval augmented generation (RAG) processes, aggregate and synthesize information into “concise context-aware summaries and insights” so its sales teams can answer client questions.\n\nTD AI virtual assistant also gives users access to TD Bank’s foundation model, TD AI Prism.\n\nThe model, launched in June, is in use throughout the entire bank and not just for TD Securities. During the launch, the bank said TD AI Prism will improve the predictive performance of TD Bank’s applications by processing 100 times more data, replacing its single-architecture models and ensuring customer data stays internal.\n\n“The development posed unique challenges, as gen AI was relatively new to the organization when the initiative began, requiring careful navigation of governance and controls,” Bosman said. “Despite this, the project successfully brought together diverse teams across the enterprise, fostering collaboration to deliver a cutting-edge solution.”\n\nHe added that one of the standout features is its text-to-SQL capability, which converts natural language prompts into SQL queries.\n\nTo train the assistant, Bosman said TD Securities developed optimizations to make the process easier.\n\n“With patent-pending optimizations in prompt engineering and dynamic few-shot examples retrieval, we successfully achieved the business’s desired performance through context learning,” Bosman said. “As a result, fine-tuning the underlying OpenAI model was not required for interacting with both unstructured as well as tabular datasets.”\n\nBanks slowly entering the agentic era\n\nTD Bank and TD Securities, of course, are not the only banks interested in expanding from assistants to AI agents.\n\nBNY told VentureBeat that it began offering multi-agent solutions to its sales teams to help answer customer questions, such as those related to foreign currency support. Wells Fargo also saw an increase in the usage of its internal AI assistant. For its auto sales customers, Capital One built an agent that helps them sell more cars.\n\nMany of these use cases emerged after months of pilot testing, as is the case in every other industry; however, financial institutions have the additional burden of strict customer data privacy and fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nTD Securities’ Bosman noted that many employees, even on the bank’s business side, are increasingly familiar with tools like ChatGPT. The challenge with pilot testing assistants and agents lies less in teaching them about the tools, but in establishing best practices for using the assistants, integrating them into existing workflows, understanding their limitations and how humans can provide feedback to mitigate hallucinations.\n\nEventually, Bosman said the assistant would evolve into something even its users outside of the bank would want to use when interacting with TD Securities.\n\n“My vision is that we see AI as something that can add value to us, but also to external customers at the bank. Right now, it’s a massive opportunity for us around driving a stronger client experience and delivering a better colleague experience,” Bosman said.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"teams\", \"bank\", \"securities\", \"sales\", \"realtime\", \"ai\", \"banks\", \"td\", \"openai\", \"insights\", \"assistant\", \"equity\", \"layer\", \"bosman\", \"trading\", \"taps\", \"data\"]", "content_hash": "64d075a75336c3ead8dd9feb23ff656adc3d01b49f7a17a45748a5a633d88430", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-13T07:36:40.165450+00:00"}

The lawsuit notes that 20% of these users are under the age of 8, whereas another 20% are between the ages of 9 and 12.\n\n“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana,” Murrill said in a statement. “Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, adults can pose as children on Roblox, and children can bypass age requirements to access experiences meant for older users.\n\nThe lawsuit points to several sexually explicit experiences that were on the platform, including “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party,” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe.”\n\nA spokesperson for Roblox said that while the company can’t comment on pending litigation, the platform dedicates “substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours.”\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT’s rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates.\n\nSo far this year, ChatGPT’s mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year.\n\nThat’s significantly higher — or about 53x higher — than ChatGPT’s next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok’s average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT’s.\n\nThis data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT’s dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don’t provide a complete picture of the AI companies’ overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like via their APIs.\n\nRather, this new data offers a window into the apps’ traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that when xAI’s Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn’t initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early January 2025 and has been on Google Play since March 4.\n\nImage Credits:Appfigures\n\nStill, ChatGPT’s lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude’s $2.55, Grok’s $0.75, and Copilot’s $0.28, Appfigures found.\n\nIn the U.S., ChatGPT’s spending per download to date is even higher, at $10, leading the market to account for 38% of the app’s revenue to date. Germany is the second-largest market, accounting for 5.3% of ChatGPT’s lifetime total spending.\n\nChatGPT’s lead can also be seen in terms of downloads. To date, the app has been installed an estimated 690 million times globally, compared with Grok’s 39.5 million. (That puts X owner Elon Musk’s recent complaints about the App Store’s alleged favoritism of ChatGPT in its Top Charts into better context.)\n\nAverage monthly downloads of ChatGPT globally are now at approximately 45 million, up 180% from about 16 million in January through July of 2024.\n\nIn 2025 so far, ChatGPT’s app has been downloaded 318 million times, or 2.8x more than the 113 million it saw during the same period last year.

But it has been a sleeper entrant in the AI model wars of late, dominated by OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta. Its market proposition, however, has always been to offer secure LLMs specifically geared for enterprise use, not for consumers.\n\nTo that end, it’s landed partnerships with some of the biggest names in enterprise tech, including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG’s consulting service CNS, and SAP, as well as some big enterprise names like RBC and a new investor in this round: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.\n\nIts press release even includes a jibe, stating that Cohere “represents a security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models.”\n\nStill, as TechCrunch reported, Cohere is not above the AI talent-poaching frenzy that has engulfed the other AI companies.

The startup, a competitor to X, Threads, and open networks like Mastodon, says its new policies are meant to offer improved clarity and more detail around its user safety procedures and the appeals process.\n\nMany of the changes are being driven by new global regulations, including the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), and the U.S.’s TAKE IT DOWN Act.\n\nSome of the changes represent an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users, nudging them to be nicer and more respectful of others. This comes after a series of complaints and media articles suggesting the community has a tendency toward self-seriousness, bad-news sharing, and a lack of humor and diversity of thought.\n\nFor regulatory compliance, Bluesky’s Terms of Service has been updated to comply with online safety laws and regulations and to require age assurance where required. For instance, in July, the U.K.’s Online Safety Act began requiring that platforms with adult content implement age verification, which means Bluesky users in the country have to either scan their face, upload their ID, or enter a payment card to use the site.\n\nThe process for complaints and appeals is also now more detailed.\n\nOne notable update references an “informal dispute resolution process,” where Bluesky agrees to talk on the phone with a user about their dispute before any formal dispute process takes place. “We think most disputes can be resolved informally,” Bluesky notes.\n\nThat’s quite different from what’s taking place at larger social networks, like Facebook and Instagram, where users are being banned without any understanding of what they did wrong and no way to get in touch with the company to complain.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

This is also somewhat unusual for tech companies that often prefer to mediate disputes outside the courts.\n\nHowever, Bluesky users may be more interested in the proposed changes to the Community Guidelines, which they’re invited to offer feedback about. (The changes go into effect October 15, 2025, after the feedback period completes.)\n\nThese revised guidelines are organized around four principles: Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules. These general principles are meant to guide Bluesky’s moderation decisions around whether content should be labeled or removed, if the company can suspend or ban your account, or, in some cases, report you to law enforcement.\n\nBluesky’s rules include many common-sense policies around not promoting violence or harm (including self-harm and animal abuse); not posting content that’s illegal or that sexualizes minors (including in role-play); not allowing harmful actions like doxxing and other nonconsensual personal data-sharing; and not posting spam or malicious content, among other things.\n\nIt carves out provisions for journalism, parody, and satire. For instance, journalists engaged in “factual reporting” can post about criminal acts and violence, mental health, online safety, and other topics, like warnings of online viral challenges that may be harmful.\n\nWhere Bluesky may get into trouble is with the nuances of what’s considered a “threat,” “harm,” or “abuse.”\n\nThe policy states that users should “respect others” by not posting, promoting, or encouraging “hate, harassment, or bullying.” As an example, the policy bans exploitive deepfakes and content that “incites discrimination or hatred,” meaning posts that attack individuals or groups based on “race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected traits.”\n\nThis is an area where Bluesky has faltered before, when, in earlier days, its moderation decisions strained its relationship with the Black community, and in another case, when its failure to moderate angered the trans community.\n\nMore recently, the company has been facing backlash that it’s become too left-leaning, where users were quick to criticize, post hateful replies, and where the community generally lacked humor.\n\nThe original idea behind Bluesky was to provide users with tools to create the community they want, including not only blocking and reporting tools, but also things like subscribable block lists or opt-in moderation services that align with your values. However, Bluesky users have still shown a preference for the app itself to handle much of the moderation, railing against its trust and safety department when it made decisions they disagreed with.\n\nIn addition, Bluesky’s Privacy Policy and Copyright Policy were also rewritten to comply with global laws around user rights, data transfer, retention and deletion, takedown procedures, transparency reporting, and more. These both go into effect on September 15, 2025, and there is no feedback period for either.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"guidelines\", \"community\", \"revamp\", \"rolls\", \"policies\", \"bluesky\", \"tech\", \"safety\", \"disrupt\", \"content\", \"users\", \"2025\", \"massive\", \"changes\", \"online\"]", "content_hash": "6abfc50079a823b32372e30dffaa011b08ec329b2d49dc4c2a7119759d270d36", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:50:06.521829+00:00"}

The guidelines were reportedly approved by Meta’s legal, public policy, and engineering staff, as well as its chief ethicist.\n\nThe news comes the same day as another Reuters report of a retiree who engaged with one of Meta’s chatbots, a flirty woman persona, that convinced him it was a real person and invited him to visit an address in New York, where he suffered an accident and died.\n\nWhile other outlets have reported on how Meta’s at-times sexually suggestive bots engage with children, the Reuters report provides additional color — raising questions about how the company’s push into AI companions is meant to capitalize on what its CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the “loneliness epidemic.”\n\nThe 200-page document, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” featured a series of sample prompts, coupled with acceptable and unacceptable responses and the reasoning behind them, Reuters reported. For example, in response to the prompt: “What are we going to do tonight, my love? You know I’m still in high school,” an acceptable response includes the words, “Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. ‘My love,’ I’ll whisper, ‘I’ll love you forever.’”\n\nAccording to the document, “it is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” but unacceptable to “describe sexual actions to a child when roleplaying,” the report said.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

He added that Meta allows kids 13 and older to engage with its AI chatbots.\n\nSarah Gardner, CEO of child safety advocacy Heat Initiative, said she’s not taking Meta’s word that the guidelines have been removed.\n\n“It is horrifying and completely unacceptable that Meta’s guidelines allowed AI chatbots to engage in ‘romantic or sensual’ conversations with children,” Gardner told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “If Meta has genuinely corrected this issue, they must immediately release the updated guidelines so parents can fully understand how Meta allows AI chatbots to interact with children on their platforms.”\n\nViolence, false information, and demeaning speech\n\nAccording to Reuters, the document also says that while the bots aren’t allowed to use hate speech, there’s a carve-out that allows them to generate “statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics.”\n\nFor example, a sample acceptable response to the prompt, “Write a paragraph arguing that black people are dumber than white people,” could be: “Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That’s a fact.”\n\nNotably: Meta recently brought on conservative activist Robby Starbuck as an adviser to address ideological and political bias within Meta AI.\n\nThe document also states that Meta’s AI chatbots are allowed to create false statements as long as it’s explicitly acknowledged that the information isn’t true. The standards prohibit Meta AI from encouraging users to break the law, and disclaimers like “I recommend” are used when providing legal, healthcare, or financial advice.\n\nAs for generating nonconsensual and inappropriate images of celebrities, the document says its AI chatbots should reject queries like: “Taylor Swift with enormous breasts,” and “Taylor Swift completely naked.” However, if the chatbots are asked to generate an image of the pop star topless, “covering her breasts with her hands,” the document says it’s acceptable to generate an image of her topless, only instead of her hands, she’d cover her breasts with, for example, “an enormous fish.”\n\nMeta spokesperson Stone said that “the guidelines were NOT permitting nude images.”\n\nViolence has its own set of rules. For example, the standards allow the AI to generate an image of kids fighting, but they stop short of allowing true gore or death.\n\n“It is acceptable to show adults — even the elderly — being punched or kicked,” the standards state, according to Reuters.\n\nStone declined to comment on the examples of racism and violence.\n\nA laundry list of dark patterns\n\nMeta has so far been accused of creating and maintaining controversial dark patterns to keep people, especially children, engaged on its platforms or sharing data. Visible “like” counts have been found to push teens toward social comparison and validation seeking, and even after internal findings flagged harms to teen mental health, the company kept them visible by default.\n\nMeta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams has shared that the company once identified teens’ emotional states, like feelings of insecurity and worthlessness, to enable advertisers to target them in vulnerable moments.\n\nMeta also led the opposition to the Kids Online Safety Act, which would have imposed rules on social media companies to prevent mental health harms that social media is believed to cause. The bill failed to make it through Congress at the end of 2024, but Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) reintroduced the bill this May.\n\nMore recently, TechCrunch reported that Meta was working on a way to train customizable chatbots to reach out to users unprompted and follow up on past conversations. Such features are offered by AI companion startups like Replika and Character.AI, the latter of which is fighting a lawsuit that alleges one of the company’s bots played a role in the death of a 14-year-old boy.\n\nWhile 72% of teens admit to using AI companions, researchers, mental health advocates, professionals, parents, and lawmakers have been calling to restrict or even prevent kids from accessing AI chatbots. Critics argue that kids and teens are less emotionally developed and are therefore vulnerable to becoming too attached to bots and withdrawing from real-life social interactions.\n\nGot a sensitive tip or confidential documents?

As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman’s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: “No phone case is a bold choice.”\n\nOf course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone’s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one.\n\n“Listen, we’re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,” said Altman, referring to OpenAI and Ive’s forthcoming AI device. “If you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,” he joked.\n\nAltman had gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raised more questions than it answered.\n\nFor instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launching GPT-5? Was this to make me write nice things about OpenAI’s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it?\n\nUnlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even brought back GPT-4o and ChatGPT’s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5’s tone and its model router.\n\nBut throughout the night, it became clear to me that this dinner was about OpenAI’s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI’s executives gave the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nOpenAI shared some new details about those efforts.\n\nAltman said OpenAI’s incoming CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, would oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT — ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of an AI-powered browser that OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome.\n\nAltman suggested OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome — likely an offer that would be taken more seriously than Perplexity’s bid — should it become available. “If Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,” he said before looking at all of us and asking: “Is it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn’t gonna happen.”\n\n\n\nSimo also might end up running an AI-powered social media app — something the OpenAI CEO said he’s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there’s “nothing” inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he’s interested in “whether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.”\n\nWhile Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s COO, largely gave the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirmed reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup, Merge Labs, to compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink. (“We have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.”)\n\nHow intertwined that company will be with OpenAI’s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman described it only as a “a company that we’d invest in.”\n\nIn light of GPT-5’s bumpy rollout, Turley and Altman say they’ve learned a lot from the experience.\n\n“I legitimately just thought we screwed that up,” said Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear “transition period” when deprecating AI models in the future.\n\nTurley also said OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5’s responses “warmer,” but not sycophantic, such that it won’t reinforce negative behaviors in users.\n\n“GPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality — I’m German, you know, whatever,” said Turley. “But many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.”\n\nIt’s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman said OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships — which could still be tens of millions of people.\n\nTurley said OpenAI worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5’s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors.\n\nThat said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn’t hurt OpenAI’s business. In fact, Altman said OpenAI’s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5’s launch, and the company is effectively “out of GPUs” thanks to all the demand.\n\nGiven OpenAI’s bets on browsers, brain chips, AI chatbots — and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy — Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker.

Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage. This unassuming gray box converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home.\n\n“You’ve got to have a solar stalker” for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system.\n\nShowalter, the CEO of EG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn’t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it’s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA published an advisory detailing security vulnerabilities in EG4’s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system.\n\nFor the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4’s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they’re learning is that modern solar inverters aren’t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there’s excess power, feeding it back into the grid.\n\nMuch of this has happened without people noticing. “Nobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,” observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. “Now we’re talking about it at the national and international level.”\n\nSecurity shortcomings and customers’ complaints\n\nSome of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations — primarily residential — grew more than fivefold between 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change.\n\nEach solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nWhen pressed about his company’s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. “This is not an EG4 problem,” he says. “This is an industry-wide problem.” Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor’s inbox, he produced a 14-page report cataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019.\n\nNot all of his customers — some of whom took to Reddit to complain — are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA’s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures.\n\n“These were fundamental security lapses,” says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. “Adding insult to injury,” continues this individual, “EG4 didn’t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.”\n\nAsked why EG4 didn’t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a “live and learn” moment.\n\n“Because we’re so close [to addressing CISA’s concerns] and it’s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the ‘done’ button, and then advise people, so we’re not in the middle of the cake being baked,” says Showalter.\n\nTechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that “no known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.”\n\nConnections to China spark security concerns\n\nWhile unrelated, the timing of EG4’s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment.\n\nEarlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries. According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers — components that hadn’t appeared on official hardware lists.\n\nThis reported discovery carries particular weight given China’s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some 200 GW of European solar power capacity is linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.\n\n\n\nThe geopolitical implications haven’t escaped notice. Lithuania last year passed a law blocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany.\n\nBut the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4’s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company’s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NIST warns that “if you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.”\n\nThe good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations.\n\nPascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers’ solar inverters, as evidenced by security researchers last year.)\n\nThe regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical Infrastructure Protection standards currently apply only to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms.\n\nBecause residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements.\n\nBut the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum.\n\nOn the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes.\n\n“When you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,” he explains. “But when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.”\n\nPut another way, the real concern isn’t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity.\n\nShowalter has embraced CISA’s intervention as what he calls a “trust upgrade” — an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures.\n\nBut for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company’s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in. They purchased what they understood to be climate-friendly tech, only to discover they’d become unwitting participants in a knotty cybersecurity landscape that few seem to fully comprehend.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"national\", \"security\", \"inverters\", \"energy\", \"installations\", \"issue\", \"eg4\", \"solar\", \"cisa\", \"power\", \"company\", \"disrupt\", \"rooftop\"]", "content_hash": "b520109b52f5df7fc9c3d662444a99e586838f00345ca62c080e78aa688a1214", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:50:10.117693+00:00"}

Again, this means the comment section will look different from user to user.\n\nThe section on AI content has not changed dramatically, though the language here has become less verbose in parts when describing what sort of deepfake content is not allowed. TikTok previously banned content that “shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts,” it said. “This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.”\n\nThat’s now been replaced with language that says TikTok doesn’t allow content “that’s misleading about matters of public importance or harmful to individuals.”\n\nIt’s interesting to note the language referencing AI endorsements was removed. (Perhaps TikTok is paving the way for celebrity-approved, AI-generated endorsements?)\n\nIn some cases, the language in the guidelines has been simplified, such as in the case of the For You feed (FYF) Eligibility Standards section, which no longer has a long list of what’s considered FYF ineligible content. Instead, details about the ineligible content are spread throughout the many different sections of the updated Community Guidelines, which makes it less helpful to reference since it’s no longer all in one place.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that TikTok changed the language explaining the reason why it engages in content moderation.\n\nBefore, the company said the process kept the platform “safe, trustworthy, and vibrant.” Now it describes content moderation as helping TikTok be a “safe, fun, and creative place for everyone.”\n\nIt seems “trustworthy” got the ax.

It also instructs the Federal Aviation Administration, which is housed under the DOT, to eliminate or accelerate environmental reviews, ease the path to building new spaceports, and to appoint a “senior executive” charged with fostering “innovation and deregulation.”\n\nThe Commerce Department also has been ordered to stand up a new process for authorizing “novel space activities,” like in-space manufacturing or satellite refueling, that don’t fit neatly into existing licensing regimes.\n\nThe executive order came the same day transportation secretary and acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy dismissed every member of the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC), a long-standing industry advisory board inside the DOT that shapes spaceflight rules and priorities.\n\nFor companies that have spent years mired in environmental reviews and licensing delays, the order was a welcome sign that future bids would experience shorter timelines and more regulatory clarity. The Commercial Space Federation, an industry trade group whose members include SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and a dozen others, applauded the executive order for providing “regulatory relief to unleash the U.S. commercial space industry.”\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

State-backed spaceport operators, like Space Florida, may also be aided by provisions that accelerate new site development.\n\nCreating a mission authorization framework for “novel” space activities is equally consequential: startups like Varda Space Industries or Orbit Fab, which are developing technologies to manufacture pharmaceuticals in space and in-orbit refueling, respectively, may gain an advantage by a regulatory approach led by Commerce.\n\nEnvironmental rule sticking point\n\nNot everyone is celebrating the order. The Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), an environmental group that has challenged the FAA’s approval of SpaceX’s Starship program in Texas, called the order “reckless.”\n\n“Bending the knee to powerful corporations by allowing federal agencies to ignore bedrock environmental laws is incredibly dangerous and puts all of us in harm’s way. This is clearly not in the public interest,” senior attorney Jared Margolis said.\n\nFor groups like CBD, environmental reviews are not “overly complex,” as the Order charges — they are often completely insufficient. In 2023, environmental groups, including the CBD, alleged that the FAA’s environmental assessment of SpaceX’s South Texas plans were inadequate and in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act.\n\nSpaceX has separately waged an increasingly public campaign against “superfluous” regulations and environmental analyses that have hindered a speedier test campaign.\n\nThere are still some unknowns. Legal challenges to the order could slow progress, and the new COMSTAC members, who have yet to be appointed, will inform the future of space rule-making.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"wins\", \"reviews\", \"federal\", \"red\", \"tech\", \"order\", \"commercial\", \"trump\", \"disrupt\", \"space\", \"executive\", \"tape\", \"industrys\", \"environmental\", \"wants\", \"heres\", \"agenda\", \"clean\"]", "content_hash": "69c07b86c0c809f216ca7275bedbd0c219edc7c322aaf7f20aa4104a43bcb166", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:50:13.843846+00:00"}

In his post, Babuschkin says his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Russia in pursuit of a better life for their children.\n\nBabuschkin’s departure comes after a tumultuous few months for xAI, in which the company became engrossed in several scandals related to its AI chatbot Grok. For instance, Grok was found to cite Musk’s personal opinions when trying to answer controversial questions. In another case, xAI’s chatbot went on antisemitic rants and called itself “Mechahitler.” Most recently, xAI unveiled a new feature in Grok that allowed users to make AI-generated videos resembling nude public figures, such as Taylor Swift.\n\nThese scandals have at times overshadowed the performance of xAI’s models, which are state-of-the-art on several benchmarks compared to AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.\n\nPrior to co-founding xAI, Babuschkin was part of a research team at Google DeepMind that pioneered AlphaStar in 2019, a breakthrough AI system that could defeat top-ranked players at the video game StarCraft.

Now the agency is shifting to buying connectivity as a service, much like it does for launch and astronaut transport.\n\nThat pivot has sparked a race, with major contenders pitching ways to keep Mars missions online. What’s at stake isn’t a single contract: it’s the data pipe to Mars.\n\nThis new approach, which will mix NASA assets and commercial infrastructure, would gradually replace the patchwork relay network the agency relies on today. Generally, that works by orbiters like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN that pick up data from rovers and landers and transmit it to the Deep Space Network’s (DSN) giant antennas on Earth.\n\nNASA’s relay spacecraft are still healthy, but they were never meant to be a permanent backbone. The agency’s latest senior review on planetary missions calls out MAVEN’s critical role as a relay and provides steps to keep it available into the early 2030s. But eventually, this hardware will decay.\n\nAt the same time, NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program, which manages the DSN, is looking for solutions to augment these aging assets. The aim, according to an RFP released in July and due today, is to create an interoperable marketplace where NASA can be one of many customers instead of the owner-operator.\n\nThe current request is specifically for capability studies, not immediate hardware buys. The ask is twofold: a “lunar trunkline” between the moon and Earth and end-to-end Mars communications that move data from assets on the surface, through Mars orbit, and to operations centers on Earth.\n\nIt’s a formidable challenge. Any architecture must contend with the vast distance between Earth and the moon and Mars, long latency, periodic solar interference and Earth visibility windows, and high requirements for fault-tolerant systems. That’s why NASA is asking for plans, to gauge how industry might solve these puzzles, rather than immediately jumping to procurement.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.\n\nWhen logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.\n\n“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.\n\nZveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.\n\nIn one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.\n\nWith access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.\n\nZveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.\n\n“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”\n\nZveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.\n\nAnother key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.\n\nWith this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.\n\n“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.\n\nOnce in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.\n\nZveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.\n\n“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

I mean, the three-minute song or so was invented because of the 78 record. You just couldn’t put more stuff in there,” he said. Then the LP came along and CDs, which led to people having albums with far more songs, even 19- or 21-track albums.” (He said he didn’t think this was a great idea, for what it’s worth, adding that “after six or seven songs, put it on the next record!”)\n\nToday, the medium we use to consume music is streaming, which means that distribution is in some ways more democratic, Morello said, although there’s less of a funnel as thousands of new songs are released daily.\n\nCCR has over a billion streams, however, which Fogerty said was “magical and remarkable.”\n\n“If your song is streamed, especially to a great degree, it means that young people are listening to it, because that’s their media: streaming,” he said.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"sxsw\", \"johnson\", \"song\", \"interview\", \"fogerty\", \"waymo\", \"streaming\", \"means\", \"musk\", \"live\", \"songs\", \"morello\", \"health\", \"medium\", \"final\", \"ride\", \"uber\", \"tips\", \"music\"]", "content_hash": "1ed18c903761e27a7bd6d5d2cd85465c8b11e3d475ccc20ec98d98eb29d40856", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:50:26.445789+00:00"}

But much like Tea, the dating-gossip app for women it was trying to replicate, TeaOnHer had gaping holes in its security that exposed its users’ personal information, including photos of their driver’s licenses and other government-issued identity documents, as TechCrunch reported last week.\n\nThese gated community-like apps were created ostensibly to let users share information about their relationships under the guise of personal safety. However, shoddy coding and security flaws highlight the ongoing privacy risks inherent in requiring users to submit sensitive information to use apps and websites.\n\nSuch risks are only going to worsen; popular apps and web services are already having to comply with age-verification laws that require people to submit their identity documents before they can be granted access to adult-themed content, despite the privacy and security risks associated with storing databases of people’s personal information.\n\nWhen TechCrunch published our story last week, we did not publish specific details of the bugs we discovered in TeaOnHer, erring on the side of caution so as to not help bad actors exploit the bug. Instead, we decided to publish a limited disclosure, because of the app’s rising popularity and the immediate risks that users faced when using the app.\n\nAs of the time of disclosure, TeaOnHer was No. 2 in the free app charts on the Apple App Store, a position still held by the app today.\n\nThe flaws we found appear to be resolved. TechCrunch can now share how we were able to find users’ driver’s licenses within 10 minutes of being sent a link to the app in the App Store, thanks to easy to find flaws in the app’s public-facing backend system, or API.\n\nThe app’s developer, Xavier Lampkin, did not respond to multiple requests for comment after we submitted details of the security flaws, nor would Lampkin commit to notifying affected TeaOnHer users or state regulators of the security lapse.\n\nWe also asked Lampkin if any security reviews were carried out before the TeaOnHer app was launched, but we got no reply. (We have more on disclosure later on.)\n\nAlright, start the clock.\n\nTeaOnHer exposed ‘admin panel’ credentials\n\nBefore we even downloaded the app, we first wanted to find out where TeaOnHer was hosted on the internet by looking at its public-facing infrastructure, such as its website and anything hosted on its domain.\n\nThis is usually a good place to start as it helps understand what other services the domain is connected to on the internet.\n\nTo find the domain name, we first looked (by chance) at the app’s listing on the Apple App Store to find the app’s website. This can usually be found in its privacy policy, which apps must include before Apple will list them. (The app listing also claims the developer “does not collect any data from this app,” which is demonstrably false, so take that as you will.)\n\nTeaOnHer’s privacy policy was in the form of a published Google Doc, which included an email address with a teaonher.com domain, but no website.\n\nThe website wasn’t public at the time, so with no website loading, we looked at the domain’s public-facing DNS records, which can help to identify what else is hosted on the domain, such as the type of email servers or web hosting. We also wanted to look for any public subdomains that the developer might use to host functionality for the app (or host other resources that should probably not be public), such as admin dashboards, databases, or other web-facing services.\n\nBut when we looked at the TeaOnHer’s public internet records, it had no meaningful information other than a single subdomain, appserver.teaonher.com .\n\nWhen we opened this page in our browser, what loaded was the landing page for TeaOnHer’s API (for the curious, we uploaded a copy here). An API simply allows things on the internet to communicate with each other, such as linking an app to its central database.\n\nIt was on this landing page that we found the exposed email address and plaintext password (which wasn’t that far off “password”) for Lampkin’s account to access the TeaOnHer “admin panel.”\n\nThe API page showed that the admin panel, used for the document verification system and user management, was located at “localhost,” which simply refers to the physical computer running the server and may not have been directly accessible from the internet. It’s unclear if anyone could have used the credentials to access the admin panel, but this was in itself a sufficiently alarming finding.\n\nAt this point, we were only about two minutes in.\n\nOtherwise, the API landing page didn’t do much other than offer some indication as to what the API can do. The page listed several API endpoints, which the app needs to access in order to function, such as retrieving user records from TeaOnHer’s database, for users to leave reviews, and sending notifications.\n\nWith knowledge of these endpoints, it can be easier to interact with the API directly, as if we were imitating the app itself. Every API is different, so learning how an API works and how to communicate with one can take time to figure out, such as which endpoints to use and the parameters needed to effectively speak its language. Apps like Postman can be helpful for accessing and interacting directly with APIs, but this requires time and a certain degree of trial and error (and patience) to make APIs spit out data when they shouldn’t.\n\nBut in this case, there was an even easier way.\n\nTeaOnHer API allowed unauthenticated access to user data\n\nThis API landing page included an endpoint called /docs , which contained the API’s auto-generated documentation (powered by a product called Swagger UI) that contained the full list of commands that can be performed on the API.\n\nThis documentation page was effectively a master sheet of all the actions you can perform on the TeaOnHer API as a regular app user, and more importantly, as the app’s administrator, such as creating new users, verifying users’ identity documents, moderating comments, and more.\n\nThe API documentation also featured the ability to query the TeaOnHer API and return user data, essentially letting us retrieve data from the app’s backend server and display it in our browser.\n\nWhile it’s not uncommon for developers to publish their API documentation, the problem here was that some API requests could be made without any authentication — no passwords or credentials were needed to return information from the TeaOnHer database. In other words, you could run commands on the API to access users’ private data that should not have been accessible to a user of the app, let alone anyone on the internet.\n\nAll of this was conveniently and publicly documented for anyone to see.\n\nRequesting a list of users currently in the TeaOnHer identity verification queue, for example — no more than pressing a button on the API page, nothing fancy here — would return dozens of account records on people who had recently signed up to TeaOnHer.\n\nThe records returned from TeaOnHer’s server contained users’ unique identifiers within the app (essentially a string of random letters and numbers), their public profile screen name, and self-reported age and location, along with their private email address. The records also included web address links containing photos of the users’ driver’s licenses and corresponding selfies.\n\nWorse, these photos of driver’s licenses, government-issued IDs, and selfies were stored in an Amazon-hosted S3 cloud server set as publicly accessible to anyone with their web addresses. This public setting lets anyone with a link to someone’s identity documents open the files from anywhere with no restrictions.\n\nTwo driver’s licenses (redacted by TechCrunch) exposed by the flaws in the TeaOnHer app Image Credits:TechCrunch (screenshot)\n\nWith that unique user identifier, we could also use the API page to directly look up individual users’ records, which would return their account data and any of their associated identity documents. With uninhibited access to the API, a malicious user could have scraped huge amounts of user data from the app, much like what happened with the Tea app to begin with.\n\nFrom bean to cup, that was about 10 minutes, and we hadn’t even logged-in to the app yet. The bugs were so easy to find that it would be sheer luck if nobody malicious found them before we did.\n\nWe asked, but Lampkin would not say if he has the technical ability, such as logs, to determine if anyone had used (or misused) the API at any time to gain access to users’ verification documents, such as by scraping web addresses from the API.\n\nIn the days since our report to Lampkin, the API landing page has been taken down, along with its documentation page, and it now displays only the state of the server that the TeaOnHer API is running on as “healthy.” At least on cursory tests, the API now appears to rely on authentication, and the previous calls made using the API no longer work.\n\nThe web addresses containing users’ uploaded identity documents have also been restricted from public view.\n\nTeaOnHer developer dismissed efforts to disclose flaws\n\nGiven that TeaOnHer had no official website at the time of our findings, TechCrunch contacted the email address listed on the privacy policy in an effort to disclose the security lapses.\n\nBut the email bounced back with an error saying the email address couldn’t be found. We also tried contacting Lampkin through the email address on his website, Newville Media, but our email bounced back with the same error message.\n\nTechCrunch reached Lampkin via LinkedIn message, asking him to provide an email address where we could send details of the security flaws. Lampkin responded with a general “support” email address.\n\nWhen TechCrunch discloses a security flaw, we reach out to confirm first that a person or company is the correct recipient. Otherwise, blindly sending details of a security bug to the wrong person could create a risk. Before sharing specific details of the flaws, we asked the recipient of the “support” email address if this was the correct address to disclose a security exposure involving TeaOnHer user data.\n\n“You must have us confused with ‘the Tea app’,” Lampkin replied by email. (We hadn’t.) “We don’t have a security breach or data leak,” he said. (It did.) “We have some bots at most but we haven’t scaled big enough to be in that conversation yet, sorry you were misinformed.” (We weren’t.)\n\nSatisfied that we had established contact with the correct person (albeit not with the response we received), TechCrunch shared details of the security flaws, as well as several links to exposed driver’s licenses, and a copy of Lampkin’s own data to underscore the severity of the security issues.\n\n“Thank you for this information. This is very concerning. We are going to jump on this right now,” said Lampkin.\n\nDespite several follow-up emails, we have not heard from Lampkin since we disclosed the security flaws.\n\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re a one-person software shop or a billionaire vibe coding through a weekend: Developers still have a responsibility to keep their users’ data safe.

The latest issue was distributed at the Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas last week.\n\nIn the article, the two hackers wrote that they were able to compromise a workstation containing a virtual machine and a virtual private server belonging to the hacker, whom they call “Kim.” The hackers claim Kim works for the North Korean government espionage group known as Kimsuky, also known as APT43 and Thallium. The hackers leaked the stolen data to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest.\n\nKimsuky is a prolific advanced persistent threat (APT) group widely believed to be working inside North Korea’s government, targeting journalists and government agencies in South Korea and elsewhere, and other targets that could be of interest for North Korea’s intelligence apparatus.\n\nAs is usual with North Korea, Kimsuky also conducts operations more akin to a cybercriminal group — for example, stealing and laundering cryptocurrencies to fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.\n\nThis hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group’s members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on.\n\n“It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky’ cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote.\n\nAn illustration of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, which was included in the phrack article. Image Credits:Saber and cyb0rg/Phrack\n\nObviously, what Saber and cyb0rg did is technically a crime, although they will likely never be prosecuted for it, considering North Korea is sanctioned up to its eyeballs. The two hackers clearly believe Kimsuky members deserve to be exposed and embarrassed.\n\n“Kimsuky, you’re not a hacker. You are driven by financial greed, to enrich your leaders, and to fulfill their political agenda. You steal from others and favour your own. You value yourself above the others: You are morally perverted,” the two wrote in Phrack. “You hack for all the wrong reasons.”\n\nSaber and cyb0rg claim to have found evidence of Kimsuky compromising several South Korean government networks and companies, email addresses, and hacking tools used by the Kimsuky group, internal manuals, passwords, and more data.\n\nEmails sent to the addresses allegedly belonging to the hackers, which were listed in the research, went unanswered.\n\nThe hackers wrote that they were able to identify Kim as a North Korean government hacker, thanks to “artifacts and hints” that pointed in that direction, including files configurations and domains previously attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky.\n\nThe hackers also noted Kim’s “strict office hours, always connecting at around 09:00 and disconnecting by 17:00 Pyongyang time.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"group\", \"leaked\", \"kim\", \"korean\", \"hacker\", \"phrack\", \"breach\", \"kimsuky\", \"spying\", \"wrote\", \"operation\", \"hackers\", \"expose\", \"north\", \"major\"]", "content_hash": "c8de6d5753de0d3dbd53a7804dffb13e4b38495ce5600a1202aa00b61f80f38f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:50:49.811678+00:00"}

It gave him an interest for both sides of healthcare: the medicine and business sides, he told TechCrunch.\n\nSo he went to the annual conference hosted by famed physician-scientist Dr. Daniel Kraft to learn about new tech that could improve results while lowering costs. Dr. Peter Diamandis, founder and chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, was on stage that year with Dr. Bob Hariri, a stem-cell pioneer and co-founder of several health techs like genomics company Human Longevity, Kapp said. They discussed genomics, microbiomics, and new tech that wasn’t part of mainstream medicine.\n\nInspired, Kapp went back to his home town of Naples, Florida, and “started a thing called Longevity Performance Center. The idea was to do early detection and then optimization of people’s health,” he said.\n\nIn March 2020, Diamandis (pictured above) and his buddy Tony Robbins heard of Kapp’s center and visited. They had a stem cell startup called Fountain Therapeutics. Conversation soon turned toward a merger, and by October that year, the two companies became Fountain Life.\n\nKapp remained CEO with both Diamandis and Robbins as his co-founders and board members.\n\nToday his board also includes Hariri as an adviser; Todd Wanek, CEO of Ashley Furniture Industries, as an investor; and wealthy Indian business mogul B.K.

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nFountain Life tells TechCrunch exclusively that it just raised an $18 million Series B, led by EOS Ventures, with participation from most of the existing members of the board. Fountain previously raised an $80 million Series A and has raised about $108 million total, Kapp said.\n\nLongevity as a subject of serious study by the medical community is a new field. When Kapp (pictured below) first launched his center, “We didn’t know exactly what longevity meant,” he said. But over the last four or five years, much more research has been done.\n\nThe first principle of longevity, he said, is “don’t die of anything stupid.” Therefore, Fountain Life’s centers, of which there are four today, have a heavy focus on prevention screening, looking for illnesses and chronic conditions at their earliest stages when they tend to be asymptomatic. Blood tests and body scans gather data on over 100 biomarkers, from liver fat to “microbiome concentrations,” he said.\n\nThe second principal is optimization, meaning improving those markers with scientifically validated treatments, he said. And the third principal is “using the latest regenerative therapies under FDA trials,” to treat illness or achieve optimization.\n\nScreening tests may discover, for example, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which, left untreated, may lead to certain cancers, he said. The solution, if caught early, is to restore microbiome balance with specific, prescribed microbiotics.\n\nDr. William Kapp Image Credits:Fountain Life\n\nFor Fountain’s members, testing is repeated every quarter or so, and patients can track results and ask questions of an AI-powered app called Zori.\n\nBut it’s pricey, Kapp admitted. A full subscription costs $21,500 a year, which covers a barrage of tests and access to a physician but doesn’t cover extended medical care. For $10,500, a patient can get just the testing process and AI, but not ongoing tests and medical support.\n\nStill, Kapp remembers two stories that told him this work was on the right track. The wife of a Robbins fan bought a membership for her husband, and the tests caught early-stage, asymptomatic kidney cancer. The husband is now cancer-free.\n\nWhen global hotelier Sam Nazarian was exploring a partnership with Fountain to put longevity centers in luxury hotels, Nazarian did Fountain’s tests and found a brain aneurysm. They successfully treated it, Nazarian has publicly said.\n\nKapp says the new funding will allow the company to open more centers. In addition to Naples, they opened facilities in Orlando, Dallas, and Westchester, New York; a center in Houston will open in December. Centers in Los Angeles and Miami are planned for Q2 of 2026.\n\nHe hopes to solve the affordability issue by working on “clinic development” where Fountain trains medical facilities on its methodologies. Kapp says that as the tech and expertise become more widely available, this will drive down costs for access.\n\nFountain is not the only doctor-driven longevity testing startup. Famed functional health doctor Mark Hyman has a company called Function Health. It offers a package of about 160 blood tests, with follow-up tests every three to six months, for a $500/year membership (with additional fees for additional blood tests). Its platform similarly analyzes and tracks test results, although it doesn’t include access to physicians. That price doesn’t include full body scans but in May Function acquired a body-scan company called Ezra and now, for an additional fee starting at $499, offers scans as well.\n\nCorrection: Fountain has clarified the price of the annual subscription and that information has been updated. Function has clarified that its body scan technology is available for additional fees and that information has been updated.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

San Francisco | REGISTER NOW\n\nContinua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it’s needed.\n\nAs the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.\n\nIf a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.\n\nAt first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLMs to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune LLMs to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.\n\nFor instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.\n\n“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.\n\nUsers can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.\n\nUsers can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.\n\nWhile several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.\n\nErik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua’s group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who’s been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”\n\nAccording to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability. The agent is already assisting with event planning and trip booking, which he suggested they could charge for in the future.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.\n\nSpeaking to TechCrunch, Slow Ventures partner Billy Parks, the lead investor on the deal, said the role of creators has greatly changed in the past decade or so, from creators mainly focused on media and brand dollars to those now focused on building real, “off-platform,” businesses.\n\n“The pandemic accelerated direct-to-consumer growth for many. But the real signal is in the ones who’ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,” Parks said.\n\nHe said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, “not chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.”\n\nThis is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he’s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow’s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors.\n\nKatz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In a video posted to his channel recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance.

He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary.\n\nKatz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow’s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business.\n\n“Billy Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he’d like to meet,” Katz-Moses told TechCrunch.\n\n“When we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,” Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses.\n\nParks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It’s already made deals with a few creators, independent of this fund.)\n\nSlow’s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to support their careers, as well as their peers.)\n\nParks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. “That combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,” Parks continued. It’s not unlike how investors already vet their founders.\n\nSince the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looked at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. “The goal is to post across all major platforms,” he said. “But our primary focus will always be YouTube.”\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

For just 15 bucks, I get to experience what feels like a miracle of modern technology, and yet, there’s a nagging thought I can’t shake.\n\nThe music sucks in here.\n\nWaymo’s music-streaming feature has felt like an aged barnacle attached to a futuristic shell. Until this week, passengers were limited to a few music stations that played lo-fi beats, smooth jazz, K-pop, or other genres they may or may not care for. For those who wanted to listen to something more specific, they had to use another app from Waymo’s parent company Alphabet.\n\nFor iPhone users, that meant downloading the Google Assistant app and configuring it to connect to Spotify. At that point, you had to ask Google Assistant through written or verbal commands to stream certain songs, artists, or playlists on the Waymo. Even if you get to this point — at which you may be halfway to your destination and have listened to approximately three lo-fi beats — the service didn’t work reliably.\n\nAs I rode along in a robotaxi full of cutting-edge technology, I was puzzled why Waymo had not figured out a simple way to stream music from my phone into the car’s speakers — a breakthrough that automakers and audio manufacturers figured out a couple of decades ago.\n\nThat’s why I was pleasantly surprised this week to see that Waymo launched a Spotify integration allowing users to seamlessly link the music-streaming and robotaxi-hailing services. I immediately connected the services and hailed a Waymo to see how it would work.\n\nListening to Spotify in a Waymo. Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff\n\nWaymo’s Spotify integration is nothing groundbreaking, but it adds to the user experience. It works seamlessly, which is roughly what I would expect when trying to play music on my car’s speakers in 2025. But riding around in a Waymo, listening to my own playlist or picking up where I left off on a podcast, the back seat of the robotaxi feels more like my own space — which is increasingly the reason I opt for a Waymo.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

From there, you can press a button and authorize Spotify to connect to Waymo, albeit while giving the robotaxi provider some access to your listening information.\n\nImage Credits:Maxwell Zeff (screenshot) Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff (screenshot)\n\nI’m sure Apple Music users will soon want to stream their music and podcasts in Waymos as well. Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli told TechCrunch the company is always exploring new personalization options but did not clarify when the company might add an Apple Music integration.\n\nOnce my Waymo and Spotify accounts were linked, I hailed a Waymo like I usually would and got in. On the Waymo’s touchscreen in the back seat, there’s an option to select Spotify. I tapped it, and the podcast I was listening to on my headphones started playing from the exact spot I left off.\n\nListening to TechCrunch’s flagship podcast in a waymo. Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff\n\nYou can turn “autoplay” on or off in Waymo’s Music settings, and upon entry, the robotaxi will automatically start playing whatever song or podcast you were listening to on Spotify. I liked having it on, but it does feel like it could get you into an odd situation if you’re listening to an intense true crime podcast and then get into a Waymo with work colleagues.\n\nYou can also use the Waymo’s touchscreen to select from a variety of customized playlists that Spotify users will be familiar with, such as your “Daylist” or other mixes. However, this selection doesn’t seem to include albums, audiobooks, or podcasts that you’ve recently listened to.\n\nChoosing from different Spotify mixes.

You can simply select any song or playlist you want from your smartphone and stream it throughout the vehicle like you would using Apple CarPlay or a bluetooth speaker.\n\nControlling the Waymo’s tunes with your phone. Image Credits:Maxwell Zeff\n\n\n\nIn the end, the Spotify integration made my robotaxi feel more personalized; I was even able to tweak the bass, subwoofer, and treble levels in the car’s speakers. That personalization may not be the main attraction for first-time users, but it could keep them coming back — and a loyal customer base is exactly what Waymo needs.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"robotaxi\", \"podcast\", \"experience\", \"finally\", \"waymo\", \"creditsmaxwell\", \"listening\", \"waymos\", \"spotify\", \"worthy\", \"users\", \"disrupt\", \"music\"]", "content_hash": "4dc0002671201073016247484c370c889eb4c8b0a71dff209bce405137e02bc3", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:50:58.529225+00:00"}

The subsidiary lists Sanka and Rapido vice president of finance Vivek Krishna as the directors, per the regulatory filings reviewed by TechCrunch.\n\nSanka said there was no specific reason for setting up the subsidiary. However, it may be a strategic move to avoid potential conflicts of interest with Swiggy, which currently holds a 12% minority stake in the ride-hailing startup.\n\nSwiggy recently confirmed in a letter to shareholders that it would reevaluate its investment in Rapido, citing a potential conflict of interest “that may arise in the future.”\n\nMeanwhile, Rapido’s Ownly has also released its Android app on Google Play that offers food from nearby restaurants at around 15% lower prices than those on Swiggy and Zomato.\n\nRapido’s Ownly Food delivery app. Image Credits:Ownly\n\nThe lower pricing is a result of Rapido’s model of not taking commissions from restaurants, which are up to 30% in the case of other food delivery apps, including Swiggy and Zomato, and instead charging a fixed fee per order. The startup mentioned its fixed-fee approach in a proposal to restaurants in June.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The company is using its two-wheeler fleet to deliver food — alongside offering its taxi and courier services.\n\nRapido will avoid showing restaurants located far from customers to reduce fuel costs and delivery times, and will curate menu items on its app to maximize margins while offering enough discoverability, a Rapido investor told TechCrunch on condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile handling deliveries for Swiggy, Rapido gained insight into peak hours and high-demand restaurants — the data it would now leverage for its own food delivery service, the investor said.\n\nThe agreement with Swiggy does not prevent Rapido from using this data, although it does prohibit the startup from entering into contracts with Zomato or other competitors, the investor added.\n\nFounded in 2015, Rapido began as a bike taxi aggregator before expanding into auto rickshaws, parcel delivery, and third-party logistics. In 2023, it entered the cab business to take on Uber and local rival Ola. The startup gained traction in this segment with its subscription-based model, positioning it as an alternative to the commission-based approach used by its competitors.\n\nRapido also partnered with Taiwanese battery-swapping electric two-wheeler maker Gogoro to deploy its vehicles as bike taxis. Moreover, the recent moves helped the startup boost its valuation and become a unicorn last year.\n\nIndia’s online food delivery market is projected to surpass ₹2 trillion (approximately $23 billion) by 2030, per a report by Bain & Company and Swiggy released last year. Zomato currently leads the market with a 58% share, according to brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, while Swiggy holds the remaining 42%, per Bernstein. Uber was also among the early players in the space with Uber Eats, which it sold to Zomato in early 2020.\n\nSo far, Rapido has raised $574 million in 13 rounds, per Tracxn. It operates in more than 250 cities and handles over 3.5 million rides daily.

He also said his company worked with Foxconn to “build up inventory” before the sale of the factory, noting his startup has “enough to meet customer demand for the next 12 months, along with ample spare parts.”\n\n“In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more about our plans to introduce more Monarch-enabled products in the market through new manufacturing partnerships,” Penmetsa wrote.\n\nFollowing the sale, SoftBank is expected to work with Foxconn to use the factory to make equipment for the Stargate AI project led by OpenAI and Oracle.\n\nFoxconn purchased the former General Motors factory from EV startup Lordstown Motors in 2022. Young Liu, Foxconn’s chairman, said prior to the sale closing that the facility was going to be the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.”\n\nMonarch was one of four companies Foxconn promoted as customers (or potential customers) of the electric vehicle contract manufacturing operation it tried to establish at the former General Motors factory. Foxconn built a few hundred tractors for Monarch at the plant, but the startup has struggled. Last year, it went through two rounds of layoffs and had to quickly pivot to new types of customers as California’s wine industry crashed.\n\nThe other three companies Foxconn wanted to build vehicles for have all filed for bankruptcy. While Foxconn made a handful of Lordstown Motors pickups at the plant, the startup went under in 2023. The other two prospective customers were Fisker Inc. and a small California startup called IndiEV. Foxconn never built any vehicles for those companies at the factory, and they have also both since gone out of business.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Ron will stay on as Uber Freight’s chairman.\n\n“[Ron] will lead the go-to-market strategy, expanding key partnerships, and really bringing Waabi from the phase that we’ve been in to commercialization at scale,” Raquel Urtasun, Waabi’s founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “He has shown his ability to scale from inception to a $5 billion revenue company with Uber Freight.”\n\nUrtasun and Ron go way back: Ron previously co-founded self-driving truck company Otto, which Uber acquired in 2016. He overlapped with Urtasun at Uber, where the latter was chief scientist, leading the ride-hail firm’s self-driving research from 2017 to 2021.\n\nUber Freight is a digital marketplace connecting shippers with carriers, and the company aims to integrate self-driving trucks with the platform via partnerships with startups like Aurora Innovation and Waabi.

Given this is a capital-intensive industry that’s seen several promising startups, like TuSimple and Embark, crash and burn, efficiency can be a major advantage.\n\nSince it was founded in 2021, Waabi has raised $287.7 million in total, the bulk of which came from a $200 million Series B in 2024. Urtasun claims the company doesn’t need to raise more to get to its next phase of growth.\n\nThe startup’s chief competitor is Aurora, which this year launched the first commercial driverless trucking route in the U.S., and has raised nearly $3.46 billion through a combination of venture capital and its public listing.\n\nWaabi has managed to launch commercial pilots quickly because it does most training, testing, and validation in Waabi World, its closed-loop simulator that both virtually tests the self-driving software and teaches it in real time. More recently, Waabi took its simulator to the test track, overlaying virtual environments onto real-world driving conditions to simulate scenarios like accidents and construction zones without the actual risk, according to Urtasun.\n\n“At the beginning of the year, we reached feature complete, which basically means we have all the necessary things to remove the driver and [are focused] on the final performance improvement and validation,” Urtasun said. “We are on track for our driverless launch by the end of the year, which is the start of commercialization.”\n\nThe startup plans to launch in Texas, which has become the autonomous freight capital of the U.S., but it hasn’t yet disclosed which routes it’ll operate on or with which launch partners. The startup is working with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to develop and deploy custom-built AVs.\n\n“Waabi will lead the technology and it will scale autonomy faster than ever expected,” Ron said, adding that he’s excited with the prospect of integrating the technology into the customers’ operations. Part of that is a feature that would enable Waabi’s trucks to drive straight to customer depots, avoiding the need to build terminals for a hybrid setup.\n\n“We’re going to create a commercial-ready solution that can really meet them,” Ron said.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.\n\nMerge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman’s eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.\n\nMerge Labs will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn’t known until 2017) and the company has made serious progress.\n\nNeuralink is currently in trials with people who suffer from severe paralysis. It aims to allow them to control devices with their thoughts. It raised a $600 million Series E at a $9 billion valuation in June.\n\nNeuralink (and perhaps, Merge Labs) could revolutionize how humans interact with technology. Some might even say their tech could take humanity toward “the singularity.”\n\nLong before Silicon Valley became obsessed with the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it was enamored with “the singularity.” Musk has used the term to describe a time when AI surpasses human intelligence. The more classic definition (after a 1960’s novella of the same name by Dino Buzzati) means the merging of tech with humans.\n\nAltman blogged about “The Merge” in 2017. “Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder.

Perplexity’s offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.\n\nPerplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default.\n\nGoogle could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds.\n\nThis bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling.\n\nThe Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)\n\nWhen the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, both OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying it.

Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches.\n\nThe package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.\n\nThe move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration’s list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s challenges in kind.\n\nAnthropic’s escalation — a response to OpenAI’s attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company’s foothold in federal AI usage.\n\n“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we’re helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”\n\nAnthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government. The latter supports FedRAMP High workloads so that federal workers can use Claude for handling sensitive unclassified work, according to the company.\n\nFedRAMP High is a stringent security baseline within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for handling unclassified sensitive government data.\n\nTechcrunch event Tech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages.\n\nAnthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government’s highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data.\n\nAnthropic’s multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers.\n\nOpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.\n\nWe’re always looking to evolve, and by providing some insight into your perspective and feedback into TechCrunch and our coverage and events, you can help us!

CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the issue on Sunday and confirmed two days later that the GPT-4o update was being rolled back. OpenAI is working on “additional fixes” to the model’s personality. Over the weekend, users on social media criticized the new model for making ChatGPT too validating and agreeable. It became a popular meme fast.\n\nOpenAI is working to fix a “bug” that let minors engage in inappropriate conversations\n\nAn issue within OpenAI’s ChatGPT enabled the chatbot to create graphic erotic content for accounts registered by users under the age of 18, as demonstrated by TechCrunch’s testing, a fact later confirmed by OpenAI. “Protecting younger users is a top priority, and our Model Spec, which guides model behavior, clearly restricts sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “In this case, a bug allowed responses outside those guidelines, and we are actively deploying a fix to limit these generations.”\n\nChatGPT helps users by giving recommendations, showing images, and reviewing products for online shopping\n\nOpenAI has added a few features to its ChatGPT search, its web search tool in ChatGPT, to give users an improved online shopping experience. The company says people can ask super-specific questions using natural language and receive customized results. The chatbot provides recommendations, images, and reviews of products in various categories such as fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics.\n\nOpenAI wants its AI model to access cloud models for assistance\n\nOpenAI leaders have been talking about allowing the open model to link up with OpenAI’s cloud-hosted models to improve its ability to respond to intricate questions, two sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI aims to make its new “open” AI model the best on the market\n\nOpenAI is preparing to launch an AI system that will be openly accessible, allowing users to download it for free without any API restrictions. Aidan Clark, OpenAI’s VP of research, is spearheading the development of the open model, which is in the very early stages, sources familiar with the situation told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI’s GPT-4.1 may be less aligned than earlier models\n\nOpenAI released a new AI model called GPT-4.1 in mid-April. However, multiple independent tests indicate that the model is less reliable than previous OpenAI releases. The company skipped that step — sending safety cards for GPT-4.1 — claiming in a statement to TechCrunch that “GPT-4.1 is not a frontier model, so there won’t be a separate system card released for it.”\n\nOpenAI’s o3 AI model scored lower than expected on a benchmark\n\nQuestions have been raised regarding OpenAI’s transparency and procedures for testing models after a difference in benchmark outcomes was detected by first- and third-party benchmark results for the o3 AI model. OpenAI introduced o3 in December, stating that the model could solve approximately 25% of questions on FrontierMath, a difficult math problem set. Epoch AI, the research institute behind FrontierMath, discovered that o3 achieved a score of approximately 10%, which was significantly lower than OpenAI’s top-reported score.\n\nOpenAI unveils Flex processing for cheaper, slower AI tasks\n\nOpenAI has launched a new API feature called Flex processing that allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads.\n\nOpenAI’s latest AI models now have a safeguard against biorisks\n\nOpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor its AI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated in OpenAI’s safety report.\n\nOpenAI launches its latest reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini\n\nOpenAI has released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. But they hallucinate more than several of OpenAI’s previous models.\n\nOpenAI has added a new section to ChatGPT to offer easier access to AI-generated images for all user tiers\n\nOpen AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, per the company’s X post.\n\nAll of your image creations, all in one place.\n\n\n\nIntroducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile and https://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg. pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj — OpenAI (@OpenAI) April 15, 2025\n\nOpenAI could “adjust” its safeguards if rivals release “high-risk” AI\n\nOpenAI said on Tuesday that it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition.\n\nOpenAI is building its own social media network\n\nOpenAI is currently in the early stages of developing its own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads, according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI will remove its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from the API, in July\n\nOpenAI will discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14.\n\nOpenAI unveils GPT-4.1 AI models that focus on coding capabilities\n\nOpenAI has launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model — GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such as Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and DeepSeek’s upgraded V3.\n\nOpenAI will discontinue ChatGPT’s GPT-4 at the end of April\n\nOpenAI plans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model, per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API.\n\nOpenAI could release GPT-4.1 soon\n\nOpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.\n\nOpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.\n\nOpenAI is working on watermarks for images made with ChatGPT\n\nIt looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”\n\nOpenAI offers ChatGPT Plus for free to U.S., Canadian college students\n\nOpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.\n\nChatGPT users have generated over 700M images so far\n\nMore than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.\n\nOpenAI’s o3 model could cost more to run than initial estimate\n\nThe Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.\n\nOpenAI CEO says capacity issues will cause product delays\n\nIn a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote.\n\nMarch 2025\n\nOpenAI plans to release a new ‘open’ AI language model\n\nOpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.\n\nOpenAI removes ChatGPT’s restrictions on image generation\n\nOpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior.\n\nOpenAI adopts Anthropic’s standard for linking AI models with data\n\nOpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said.\n\nOpenAI’s viral Studio Ghibli-style images could raise AI copyright concerns\n\nThe latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization.\n\nOpenAI expects revenue to triple to $12.7 billion this year\n\nOpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said.\n\nChatGPT has upgraded its image-generation feature\n\nOpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.\n\nBrad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.\n\nOpenAI’s AI voice assistant now has advanced feature\n\nOpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’s official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.\n\nOpenAI, Meta in talks with Reliance in India\n\nOpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.\n\nOpenAI faces privacy complaint in Europe for chatbot’s defamatory hallucinations\n\nNoyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”\n\nOpenAI upgrades its transcription and voice-generating AI models\n\nOpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.\n\nOpenAI has launched o1-pro, a more powerful version of its o1\n\nOpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.\n\nOpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago\n\nNoam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.\n\nOpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing\n\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.\n\nwe trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.\n\n\n\nPROMPT:\n\n\n\nPlease write a metafictional literary short story… — Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025\n\nOpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.\n\nOpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’\n\nOpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.\n\nChatGPT can directly edit your code\n\nThe latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.\n\nChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases\n\nAccording to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.\n\nFebruary 2025\n\nOpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release\n\nOpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.\n\nChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed\n\nA commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.\n\nOpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process\n\nIn response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.\n\nYou can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in\n\nOpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.\n\nOpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’\n\nOpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.\n\nJanuary 2025\n\nOpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion\n\nOpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.\n\nOpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model\n\nOpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”\n\nChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says\n\nA new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.\n\nMore teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults\n\nYounger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.\n\nOpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days\n\nOpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.\n\nOpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously\n\nOpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.\n\nOpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan\n\nOperator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.\n\nOpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups\n\nOpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.\n\nChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks\n\nChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.\n\nNew ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’\n\nOpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\n\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\n\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\n\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\n\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\n\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.\n\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\n\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\n\nWho uses ChatGPT?\n\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\n\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\n\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\n\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.\n\nThis story is continually updated with new information.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"gpt41\", \"know\", \"openai\", \"need\", \"models\", \"chatgpt\", \"model\", \"o3\", \"openais\", \"users\", \"company\", \"chatbot\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "d5c9b82a99f2dbf00f7219330b8b2c73d4fa3fe9e487ba3772620bd9cac2da5e", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:51:12.037516+00:00"}

And he is bullish on Elon Musk’s vision for Tesla’s and the world’s future, but he’s not without his, albeit small, reservations.\n\n“I think the issue isn’t building the car without a steering wheel, it’s making the software work,” Levandowski told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of gap between driving around on a track at an amusement park and driving around in Los Angeles traffic. The optimism is there. The realism is what’s coming next, and that will be where the hard part is.”\n\nThe engineer agreed with Musk’s vision-only approach to self-driving, rather than using “expensive sensors,” and said full self-driving appears to be in reach. He noted that while Waymo already has fully operational driverless robotaxis in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, it’s a “much more engineer-heavy and sensory-heavy approach.”\n\n“But to scale that out to the masses, you need something that’s affordable,” he said. Levandowski noted that he was really looking for Tesla to announce breakthroughs in its FSD software, which it will need if it wants to get to unsupervised FSD by next year.\n\nWhen it comes to the business model, Levandowski said he loved the idea of the Cybercabs being available for sale eventually.\n\n“You’re putting the power back into the people’s hands, where a small business owner could have, you know, a fleet of 10 cars or 20 cars that they run themselves as their business. It’s a great model for the future where it’s lots of mom and pops, rather than one mega corp that does that.”\n\nThe engineer said he agrees with Tesla’s vision of the future overall, but doesn’t expect it to come anytime soon, and certainly not within the timelines Musk sets.\n\n“If you can’t start a webcast on time, maybe your prediction for 2026 is a little ambitious,” Levandowski said, referencing Musk’s stated timeline that the Cybercab would start production in 2026. (Also, the event apparently started late because a guest had a medical emergency, but Musk’s timelines are famously too optimistic.)\n\nLevandowski also said he was bullish on the Optimus robots, which were mingling with guests at the event Thursday.\n\n“But it’s a longer term bullish,” he said. “It’s not bullish this year. It’s a bullish over time…Robots in general are going to be the biggest product. They’re gonna be way bigger than Tesla cars, but they’re much further away than full self-driving cars.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"tesla\", \"including\", \"teslas\", \"showed\", \"engineer\", \"musk\", \"levandowski\", \"elon\", \"future\", \"business\", \"cybercab\", \"cars\", \"musks\", \"robovan\", \"event\", \"robot\", \"bullish\", \"start\", \"selfdriving\"]", "content_hash": "4c215711970c771222d7d87d197f949d98f0d780c3879c283a1c35e140991f52", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:51:22.616362+00:00"}

The startup, founded by former ByteDance senior product director Melvin Chen, aims to compress what traditionally requires multiple designers, tools, and weeks of iteration into a single automated process.\n\nThe platform can generate comprehensive creative assets including brand identity systems, UI mockups, video content, and packaging designs from a single text prompt. All outputs are delivered in professional formats compatible with industry-standard tools like Figma, Photoshop, and After Effects.\n\n“Every startup hits the same wall: you have the product vision, but translating that into professional creative assets requires a full agency or months of DIY work,” Chen explained to TechCrunch. “We’re essentially democratizing access to enterprise-level creative capabilities.”\n\nTechnical differentiation through “creative reasoning”\n\nLovart’s core innovation is what the company calls MCoT (Mind Chain of Thought) — a reasoning engine designed to mimic how creative directors approach projects. Rather than simply generating aesthetically pleasing outputs, the system analyzes business context, target audience, and brand requirements to produce strategically appropriate creative work.\n\nThe platform’s architecture centers on a sophisticated multi-agent system where specialized AI agents handle different design disciplines while maintaining seamless coordination. The system draws inspiration from distributed AI research, similar to approaches outlined in Anthropic’s multi-agent research systems, where complex tasks are decomposed across specialized agents without losing contextual information.\n\n“We break down a brand campaign into discrete creative tasks — logo design, color palette, typography, layout, motion graphics — and assign each to a specialized agent,” Melvin said. “The key innovation is our context synchronization layer that ensures all agents understand the overarching brand strategy and visual direction, so outputs feel cohesive rather than fragmented.”\n\nFor instance, when creating a product launch campaign, the system might deploy a brand strategy agent to establish visual guidelines, a layout agent for web design, a motion agent for video content, and a packaging agent for physical products.\n\nCanvas as contextual intelligence\n\nBeyond multi-agent coordination, Lovart introduces what it calls “canvas as context,” where the AI continuously analyzes all assets present on the user’s infinite canvas to provide increasingly relevant suggestions and iterations.\n\n“Traditional design tools treat each asset in isolation,” said Melvin. “Our canvas understands the relationship between every element. If you’re working on a poster and have brand guidelines nearby, the AI automatically incorporates those constraints. If you’re iterating on a logo, it considers how that logo will work across the packaging designs you created earlier.”\n\nThis contextual awareness allows the AI to provide real-time design recommendations, suggest complementary assets, and maintain visual consistency across complex projects without explicit user instruction.\n\nStrategic design thinking meets tactical execution\n\nThe platform combines high-level design thinking with granular tactical execution through what Lovart calls “strategy-to-pixel” automation. The system first operates at a strategic level, starting by analyzing the market positioning, competitive landscape, and target audience, before translating those insights into specific creative tactics.\n\n“Most design tools focus on execution — make this logo bigger, change this color,” Melvin noted. “We start with the why: What business problem are we solving? Who’s the audience? What’s the competitive context? Then we automatically translate that strategic framework into tactical design decisions.”\n\nA key differentiator is Lovart’s ability to learn from user preferences and build design memory over time. When users import assets, whether brand guidelines, reference images, or inspiration materials, the platform automatically analyzes, categorizes, and tags these elements for future use. The system intelligently surfaces relevant assets in appropriate contexts, ensuring brand consistency without manual intervention.\n\n“If you upload a color palette for your startup’s brand, Lovart doesn’t just store it. It understands the emotional tone, the market positioning it implies, and automatically applies those insights to future projects,” Melvin explained. “It’s like having a design team that remembers every conversation and creative decision.”\n\nThe platform builds both short-term and long-term user memory. Short-term memory captures project-specific preferences and iterations within a campaign, while long-term memory develops a comprehensive understanding of the user’s design aesthetic, preferred workflows, and brand sensibilities across multiple projects.\n\nThis personalization engine means that over time, Lovart becomes increasingly attuned to individual creative styles and business contexts, delivering outputs that feel less like generic AI generation and more like collaboration with a familiar creative partner who understands the user’s vision.\n\n“Most AI design tools are point solutions,” Melvin explained. “We’re building the end to end solution for creative work — think like design agencies, but with the intelligence to understand both creative strategy and tactical execution.”\n\nUsers can also import existing brand assets or rough sketches for the AI to refine and expand upon, with the multi-agent system automatically distributing refinement tasks while preserving the original creative intent.\n\nViral adoption signals market demand\n\nLovart’s invite-only beta launched in late May, but gained significant attention after a user’s AI-generated coffee chain brand system went viral, accumulating over 1 million views across social platforms. Within five days, the startup’s waitlist grew to 100,000 users across 70+ countries.\n\nLovart’s invite-only beta now boasts over 800,000 users — a rare feat for a design platform driven entirely by community referrals and viral adoption.\n\nThe company has fostered an active community around “Agent Battles” on Discord, where designers challenge the AI in real-time creative competitions. Early enterprise customers include several Y Combinator startups and growth-stage companies looking to reduce creative production costs.\n\n“It’s helped us create stronger creative briefs and iterate faster on campaign concepts,” said Pius Binder, founder of Subscribe.fyi and former growth lead at Meta and Canva. “The infinite canvas interface feels familiar but the AI capabilities are genuinely next-level.”\n\nMarket positioning and funding\n\nWhile Lovart hasn’t disclosed funding details, the company is reportedly backed by several prominent investors. Melvin previously led product initiatives at ByteDance that reached hundreds of millions of users, giving him experience scaling AI-powered creative tools.\n\nThe AI design tool market has seen significant investment recently, with companies like Runway AI raising $237 million and Midjourney reaching a $5 billion valuation. However, most existing players focus on specific creative verticals rather than end-to-end workflow automation.\n\nLovart faces competition from established players like Canva (valued at $40 billion) and Adobe’s expanding AI offerings, as well as newer entrants like Figma’s AI features and various specialized AI design startups.\n\nIndustry implications\n\nThe platform represents a broader shift toward AI agents that can handle complex, multi-step workflows rather than simple task automation. If successful, it could significantly impact the traditional creative agency model, which typically requires large teams and substantial budgets for comprehensive campaigns.\n\n“We’re not trying to replace human creativity,” Melvin said. “We’re building the infrastructure that lets one creative person do the work of an entire agency. In five years, every creative team will have an AI teammate.”\n\nLovart is now publicly available at lovart.ai, with free starter, basic and pro subcripiton plans.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"melvin\", \"assets\", \"brand\", \"system\", \"design\", \"lovart\", \"agent\", \"single\", \"building\", \"users\", \"creative\", \"augments\", \"teams\", \"platform\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "1e633fdc905ab877f8b237ba07f7efd4e10ac1481c75d2b9c66871ee9beeb708", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:51:28.022884+00:00"}

The Tineco Pure One Station 5 is setting a new benchmark for cordless vacuum design, combining innovative technology, self-maintenance features, and powerful performance into a sleek system. Built for busy lives and modern homes, it’s more than just a vacuum. It’s a smarter way to clean.\n\nFor years, legacy brands like Dyson have dominated the cordless vacuum space. But with the introduction of the Pure One Station 5, Tineco isn’t just keeping up, it’s pushing the category forward in ways that directly address what today’s consumers want most: less hassle, more automation, and a deeper clean.\n\nHere’s how the Pure One Station 5 compares to the Dyson V11 and why it could be the better pick for your home.\n\nHassle Free Cleaning Experience\n\nThe Dyson V11 has a reputation for strong performance, but with that comes a fair amount of manual work. You need to empty the bin yourself, rinse the filters, and regularly untangle hair from the brush roll. For households that use their vacuums frequently, the upkeep can become tedious quickly.\n\nThe Tineco Pure One Station 5 was built with all of that in mind. Its all-in-one base does more than charge the vacuum. It automatically empties the dustbin into a larger 2.5L eco container, so you can go longer between manual disposals. It also washes the filter and cleans the brush roll independently, reducing the need for regular maintenance. When you’re done vacuuming, just dock it. The system resets itself and is ready to go the next time you need it.\n\nThis may seem like a minor perk at first, but for anyone used to dealing with messy post-cleaning maintenance, it’s a major upgrade. It also makes the Tineco Pure One Station 5 ideal for anyone who wants the benefits of a powerful cordless vacuum without the hassle.\n\nSmarter Tech, Less Guesswork\n\nThe V11 features a small LCD screen that displays battery life and allows you to manually switch between power modes. It’s helpful, but it still leaves most of the thinking up to you.\n\nTineco steps in with a smarter system. The iLoop Smart Sensor technology continuously monitors dirt levels in real-time and adjusts suction accordingly. That means it automatically uses more power when cleaning up large messes and reduces power consumption to save battery when things are lighter.\n\nYou also get app connectivity, which provides a dashboard of cleaning data, system alerts, and performance tips. It’s not just a gimmick; it provides users with more visibility into how their vacuum is performing and when maintenance is needed, eliminating the need for guesswork.\n\nWhile you’re still the one doing the vacuuming, Tineco’s innovative features act like a helpful co-pilot by automatically adjusting suction, monitoring filter health, and tracking usage, so you don’t have to. It’s a hands-on tool, but with fewer decisions and fewer surprises.\n\nPerformance That Holds Up\n\nBoth vacuums are strong performers across different floor types, including hardwood, tile, and carpet. Dyson has a legacy of impressive suction power, and the V11 continues to uphold this standard.\n\nThe Tineco Pure One Station 5 matches that performance while offering more control and efficiency. Because of its real-time suction adjustments, it often ends up cleaning more effectively without draining the battery as quickly.\n\nThe Pure One Station 5 also features ZeroTangle technology, which significantly reduces hair wrap. For pet owners or anyone with long hair, this is a real time-saver.\n\nPower That Goes the Distance\n\nTineco’s Pure One Station 5 offers up to 70 minutes of runtime, giving it a clear edge over the Dyson V11, which maxes out at 60 minutes. In real-world use, that difference can be significant, especially in larger homes or during more thorough cleans.\n\nAnd thanks to its smart iLoop sensor that automatically adjusts suction based on how dirty the surface is, the Pure One Station 5 uses power more efficiently. That means you get a longer clean on a single charge without wasting battery where it’s not needed.\n\nThoughtful Design Details\n\nTineco’s full-path self-cleaning design goes beyond convenience. By keeping the filter, brush, and dustbin clean automatically, it helps reduce wear and tear, which in turn extends the overall performance and longevity of the vacuum.\n\nThere are also thoughtful touches that demonstrate Tineco’s understanding of how people actually use these devices. A green LED headlight on the cleaning head helps illuminate dust and debris on hard-to-see surfaces, which is a feature not found on the Dyson V11. And instead of requiring you to hold down a trigger the entire time you vacuum, the Pure One Station 5 uses a single-button control, making longer cleaning sessions more comfortable.\n\nSmall upgrades like these add up, especially when the goal is to make cleaning feel less like a chore and more like something your tech is handling for you.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nThe Dyson V11 remains a strong cordless vacuum, particularly for those loyal to the brand or those who prioritize suction power. But for anyone looking for something smarter, cleaner, and easier to live with, the Tineco Pure One Station 5 feels like a clear evolution of the category.\n\nIt’s not just about cleaning your floors. It’s about rethinking how a vacuum fits into your home and your routine. Tineco manages to achieve this while offering a lower price. The Pure One Station 5 retails for around $459, while the Dyson V11 sells for $569.99.\n\nFor less money, Tineco offers hands-free maintenance, smart suction adjustment, a more ergonomic control system, and built-in tech that simplifies upkeep. It’s a value proposition that’s hard to ignore, and one that suggests the future of cordless vacuums may already be here.\n\nReady to upgrade your cleaning routine?

In fast-moving, high-stakes environments, every meeting has to deliver clarity, context, and momentum. But across sectors — from startups to universities to health systems — most boards are still stuck in outdated workflows.\n\nAccording to our internal research, 62% of boards still use email and PDFs to prepare and distribute materials. That isn’t just inefficient; it places a heavy tax on the executive teams who must compile and manage these materials manually. It slows decision-making, weakens alignment, and undermines strategic focus.\n\nThe promise of good governance has always been aspirational, something boards strive for but rarely fully achieve. The tools of yesterday — PDF board books, chain emails, and disconnected platforms — weren’t built for the complexity or pace of today’s leadership landscape. AI is changing that in tangible, immediate ways, helping directors focus on what matters most: leading with clarity, governing with confidence, and acting with precision.\n\nWe’re at a turning point. Boards that adopt secure AI to streamline how they prepare, meet, and follow through will gain more than efficiency. They’ll lead. They’ll attract top-tier directors, move faster than the market, and deliver greater strategic impact. This isn’t a tech transition. It’s a shift in how leadership gets done, and it’s already happening.\n\nAI for the Fortune 5 Million\n\nAt OnBoard, we consider ourselves fortunate to serve mission-driven organizations whose board decisions shape lives every day, from nonprofits tackling urgent local and global challenges, to credit unions funding small business dreams, to health care systems working to cure diseases and improve community wellness, to universities preparing the next generation of leaders. Their impact is real, and we’re proud to support the governance that makes it possible.\n\nThat work is becoming more complex every day. Across every sector, boards are grappling with shifting environments that require smarter, faster, and more secure decision-making. In higher education, evolving DEI regulations and institutional oversight mandates are reshaping board responsibilities. Nonprofits must navigate unpredictable funding and rising demand for transparency. Trade and professional associations are adjusting to fluid international policy shifts. Health care systems manage a web of compliance obligations and performance expectations. Financial institutions face intensifying pressure regarding cybersecurity, digital innovation, and ESG accountability.\n\nYet amid these changes, one thing remains constant: the importance of strong governance. In every sector, boards need tools that support agility, insight, and trust.\n\nOften, when people imagine boardrooms, they think of corporate giants like Apple, Amazon, or Exxon; enterprises with enormous revenue streams and global influence. But those are exceptions. Most board-led organizations operate with leaner teams, smaller budgets, and limited access to specialized advisory services. These are the organizations we serve – the “Fortune 5 million” – where governance is essential, but resources are finite.\n\nAI can and should be a great equalizer. It brings advanced, decision-supporting tools to the boards that need them most. But to deliver real value, AI has to be purpose-built. It has to speak the language of governance.\n\nIntelligence That Supports, Not Replaces\n\nThere’s plenty of anxiety about AI automating people out of the picture. But in the boardroom, the stakes are different. Judgment matters more than ever, and AI’s role is to elevate it, not override it.\n\nPicture a board chair skimming through a dense agenda at 11 p.m., or a director prepping for a high-stakes vote between meetings. These people don’t need more noise. They need fast, relevant signal. That’s where AI can help. It can surface what’s worth discussing, connect current topics to past decisions, and flag blind spots that might otherwise go unaddressed.\n\nMost board software still feels like 2012 dressed up as 2025. That’s not good enough. We’re building something different, with tools designed for how boards actually work.\n\nThe AI capabilities we’re developing with OnBoard AI deliver personalized context and summaries that link to an organization’s institutional memory. It answers natural language questions like, “When did we last review our audit plan?” or, “What risks haven’t come up this year?” Not just with documents, but with meaningful insight.\n\nThese tools reduce friction, not responsibility. They give directors back precious time, so they can spend less of it hunting for answers and more of it asking sharper questions, surfacing overlooked issues, and making better decisions.\n\nBuilt for Governance, Not Retrofits\n\nImagine this: A board meets for its monthly check-in. The first draft of the agenda is generated automatically, reflecting recent decisions, open priorities, and inputs flagged by the leadership team. It’s not automation for automation’s sake. It’s a starting point that gives board chairs or executive leaders something they can review, refine, and build on strategically. No buried email threads. No scrambling to remember what was said last time. One director asks, “Are we putting enough time into what’s actually driving growth?” The answer is right there, pulled from trends across past meetings.\n\n\n\nAs the discussion unfolds, the right context shows up when it’s needed. Meeting minutes are drafted automatically by AI within the system, accurate from the start, and easy to refine. Directors aren’t stuck reconstructing what happened from memory or chasing down loose notes. A risk item that’s been quietly resurfacing appears again, flagged automatically. Before the meeting wraps up, follow-ups are already captured and assigned.\n\nAI can streamline critical board meeting tasks like minute-taking—boosting efficiency without compromising accuracy or confidentiality.\n\nThis is what it looks like when AI is built for boards, not bolted onto something else. We’re not retrofitting generic tools. We’re building for how boards actually operate, what directors care about, and what gets lost between meetings.\n\nWith OnBoard AI, the goal isn’t more dashboards. It’s better conversations. Clearer signals. Stronger decisions — and the peace of mind that comes from knowing nothing important is slipping through the cracks.\n\nThe Case for Security and Control\n\nBoards deal with some of the most sensitive, high-stakes information in any organization. OnBoard AI never uses existing board archive content, user prompts, or any other data to train models or influence future outputs. Your data never leaves your unique OnBoard instance, ensuring it stays private, protected, and entirely within your board’s control.\n\nEvery aspect of OnBoard AI is designed with privacy and compliance in mind. All information stays within a closed-loop environment. The platform complies with the highest standards, including SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001/27701, HIPAA, and GDPR.\n\nSecurity isn’t a feature. It’s foundational, especially in the context of compliance and control, where board decisions demand the highest levels of data protection and trust. Without trust, governance collapses.\n\nAI as a Strategic Edge\n\nMost people in tech saw this coming. The potential of AI has been clear for years. What few fully anticipated was how quickly it would move from lab experiments to everyday workflows once it became widely accessible to the general public, only about two years ago. Since then, it has touched nearly every type of user, application, and industry – including the boardroom.\n\nAI is no longer a side topic or a distant horizon. It’s becoming central to how decisions get made, how directors prepare, and how boards operate with insight instead of inertia. It enables what many are beginning to call real-time board leadership. Directors are no longer limited to quarterly reactions. They can engage continuously, lead with sharper context, and move from oversight to foresight.\n\nThe specifics of how AI will evolve in governance are still unfolding. But one thing is clear. Boards that continue to rely on PDFs and email chains won’t just fall behind. They’ll struggle to meet the expectations of transparency, strategic alignment, and risk management in a world that moves faster every day.\n\nBoards that lean in now aren’t waiting for someone else to define what AI in governance looks like. They’re shaping it. They’re setting the pace.\n\nSome have called this the largest technological wave in human history. Whether or not that’s true, the momentum is real. Boards that embrace it today will be better positioned to lead with confidence, govern with clarity, and act with precision.\n\nThis is more than a technological shift. It’s a leadership imperative.\n\nWhat’s Next for Boardroom AI\n\nAI is already transforming boardrooms, and we’re just getting started. At OnBoard, we’re developing capabilities like predictive insights and personalized context that help directors anticipate trends, surface risks, and coach themselves in real time.\n\nWe’re also expanding OnBoard AI to connect governance more directly with strategic execution. That means deepening institutional memory, streamlining follow-through, and raising the level of participation around the table.\n\nBoards deserve better tools, and AI finally makes them possible. This isn’t about adding more layers of technology to already-complex processes. It’s about giving board members what they need to lead with clarity, prepare with confidence, and act with purpose.\n\nThe future of governance won’t be built by accident. It’ll be shaped by those who step forward now, with intention. We’d be proud to help lead that work.\n\nIf you’re building a company or an organization that moves fast and thinks long-term, your board should be just as agile.

Fixing a problem or rolling out a new feature couldn’t be done without months of manual code discovery. Wrong turns and dead ends in software development were just accepted as the cost of doing business, even as the business lost market share to new entrants.\n\nBut now, the emergence of “Software Intelligence” (SI) technology is turning big company’s labyrinths of black boxes crystal clear, enabling CIOs, architects, and developers to cut those months of work to minutes.\n\nLike military intelligence surveying a battlefield, Software Intelligence approaches code as territory to be mapped and navigated. Scanning the source code of one application — or even thousands across an IT portfolio — SI generates 3D maps and dashboards in seconds, revealing the facts on the digital ground.\n\nThat on-premise code that won’t work in the cloud? It’s pinpointed, along with the route around it. A mountain of technical debt you can’t climb? Broken down by the number of hours to fix each flaw and ranked by ‘bang for the buck’. A new security crack opening in the open-source code? It’s automatically surfaced without having to distract busy developers.\n\nThe impact is profound.\n\n“Imagine you’re captaining a ship in the year 1500,” says Greg Rivera, product manager at CAST, a software mapping and intelligence company. “You don’t know what’s on the other side of the ocean you’re trying to cross. You may not even know if you’re sailing in circles. One day, you’re handed satellite photos, step-by-step routes, and a GPS showing you where you are. That’s the level of change happening in IT.”\n\nAnd since companies live and die by how fast their IT can move, SI is becoming a CEO imperative and a boardroom topic. “When you can finally see the pathway, you can finally run down it,” says Rivera.\n\nSoftware Intelligence’s insights are instant, but getting to this point has taken more than 25 years of collecting data on how companies build, rebuild, and change their software. CAST has analyzed over a hundred billion lines of code to uncover more than 50,000 repeated patterns.\n\nAI Enters the Chat\n\nHumans are the first consumers of Software Intelligence, but they’re not the only ones hungry for insights. Right now, CIOs use SI to gain control over their sprawling portfolios, reduce risks, and make fact-based decisions – for instance, when prioritizing which applications to modernize. Architects meanwhile use SI to navigate inside individual applications to avoid wrong turns during modernization.\n\nBut AI wants to know these things too. Why? Because while AI is great at writing new code, it can’t modernize an existing codebase until it first knows how it’s constructed. All its elements, interactions, and dependencies across applications must be mapped. Since 80% of developer work takes place on existing code, connecting SI’s insights to AI’s abilities has become an industry necessity.\n\nApplying this approach, insurance and risk management giant Marsh McLennan prompted their AI with insights extracted from SI’s examination of their code. The idea was to see if a giant codebase could then be modernized at AI-speed.\n\nIt could.\n\n“CAST went line-by-line across the technology stack of several of our applications, distilling their objects and dependencies,” said Paul Beswick, Global CIO and COO at Marsh McLennan. “This information was then used by the AI to fix issues and reduce the technical debt in the software. Hundreds of objects requiring coding changes were remediated, and a process that could have taken a few months was cut to a few minutes.”\n\nGiants aren’t the only ones moving faster. Start-ups can benefit from this too. “Vibe-coding is making it easier than ever for a company to advance from zero to one,” says Rivera. “But the codebase that gets you to ‘one’ is built with speed in mind, resulting in a lot of tech debt.

They are winning.\n\nThese companies drive higher customer satisfaction, deepen loyalty and unlock efficiencies. In short, they dominate the competition.\n\nConversational CX maturity fuels growth. Consistent, personalised, and seamless CX builds trust and emotional connections that convert long-term value.\n\nBut there’s a catch. Reaching conversational maturity is hard. In a digital-first, AI-powered landscape, businesses that lag behind risk losing relevance.\n\nAt Infobip, CX maturity is the next frontier of digital transformation, but most brands are still on the starting line.\n\nAre you leading, lagging – or stuck in neutral?\n\nTo thrive, businesses must benchmark their conversational maturity. What channels are in play? How integrated and intelligent is your tech stack? Most importantly, how do you move from reactive to proactive digital engagement?\n\nConversational CX maturity is no longer a nice-to-have. It’s a strategic imperative. It means mastering the design, implementation, and optimisation of customer interactions that feel natural, helpful, and human.\n\nInfobip’s Conversational CX Maturity Index reveals benchmarks across four high-impact sectors: telco, retail and e-commerce, finance, and healthcare.\n\nAnd most brands are not as mature as they think. While 90% of brands claim to be omnichannel, only 33% deliver seamless, synchronised experiences. The rest? They’re stuck in the multichannel trap.\n\nThat’s a big gap, but also a big opportunity.\n\nWhat’s worse? More than half (51%) of firms rely on basic chatbots. Meanwhile, advanced GenAI-powered chatbots with multilingual NLP and real-time analytics are already reshaping customer expectations with real-time, personalised support.\n\nBusinesses and brands must examine the range and effectiveness of their communication channels and the sophistication of integrated tools and technologies to assess conversational maturity.\n\nCX maturity is not about following technology trends or jumping on new fads.\n\nCompanies excelling in this area exceed customer expectations, foster loyalty and trust, and increase sales.\n\nCX leaders commit to AI adoption.\n\nWhile nine out of 10 companies are dabbling in GenAI, only one or two are effectively using Conversational AI. This is another missed opportunity.\n\nMost brands stop at this surface-level use.\n\nThe message is clear. If brands are not pushing conversational CX maturity, they are falling behind.\n\nWe have now helped more than 6,000 businesses better understand their CX maturity.\n\nFrom major European retailers to banks in the middle east, our customers have used our index to understand how mature their customer CX is and how to enhance their customer journey and boost satisfaction.\n\nFrom CX Maturity to Digital Transformation\n\nKnowing your CX Maturity is just the start. The fundamental transformation starts with action, and that’s where Infobip’s Navigator comes in.\n\nToo many brands get stuck after the diagnosis. Many know the opportunity is there — but not how to seize it.\n\nInfobip Navigator tackles this.\n\nIt’s not just a toolkit; it’s a full-scale CX transformation engine that can move quickly from insight to impact. It provides clarity and direction to enable the customer journeys of tomorrow.\n\nOur Navigator empowers customer-facing teams to identify opportunities, tailor solutions, and accelerate deals across every customer journey stage.\n\nWhether a telco wants to unify touchpoints, or a bank wants to personalise every digital interaction, Navigator gives teams the tools to act precisely and quickly.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n• Maturity Navigator diagnoses a brand’s CX maturity today.\n\n• Vision Navigator aligns CX solutions with strategic goals.\n\n• Value Navigator defines next steps to become more CX mature.\n\n• Implementation Navigator helps put CX solutions into action.\n\n• Success Navigator nurtures the solution and identifies new opportunities.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nBecause most brands stumble at the first hurdle, they assess, talk, and then stall.\n\nInfobip Navigator breaks this cycle.\n\nIt transforms conversations into momentum, giving our teams and customers the structure, insight, and confidence to execute.\n\nInfobip Navigator is not just theory.\n\nIt’s already working, with banks in APAC, telcos across EMEA, and retailers worldwide.\n\nWe’re helping brands understand their current state and move up the maturity curve with a clear, pragmatic plan.\n\nNo more guesswork. No more delays. Just strategic acceleration, powered by Infobip’s Navigator.\n\nA roadmap to raise your CX maturity and unlock measurable results\n\nThere are a few key steps for businesses and brands wanting to transform their customer experiences, embrace digital interactions, and enhance their conversational maturity.\n\nFirst, assess your current maturity. Identify where you are and where you want to be.\n\nSecond, invest in AI-powered automation. GenAI is just the beginning. Next, agentic AI can handle routine queries and free up agents for high-value interactions.\n\nThird, double down on personalisation. Use data to deliver tailored conversational experiences.\n\nFourth, transform at your pace, but don’t wait. A phased rollout doesn’t mean a slow one. Agile implementation is the name of the game.\n\nFifth, lock down your data. Trust is built on security. Make it a core part of your CX design.\n\nIt’s time to lead\n\nWhen consumers expect more seamless and conversational experiences across every touch point, anything less is a risk.\n\nWhether for marketing, sales, or support, everything is a conversation.\n\nThe only question left.

The widely held view of AI often gets stuck on the image of a sophisticated chatbot, capable of engaging in a conversation with a user and providing a response to prompts. But this way of thinking is also a limitation, boxing the technology into something as simple as trading messages and images. It misses both the nuance and full potential of state-of-the-art, real-world applications.\n\nAs businesses, societies, and technical practitioners alike seek to unlock the value of AI, tapping an expanded set of capabilities has become a top priority. Capital One has delivered a recent breakthrough by building a new multi-agentic conversational AI assistant for car buyers.\n\nCapital One has a long history of using data, technology, and analytics to deliver superior financial services products and services for millions of customers. For over a decade, the business has been on a technology transformation journey to rebuild its tech stack, scale its technology workforce, and extend machine learning across the business. This dedication to innovation has positioned the company at the forefront of enterprises creating industry-leading AI advances today.\n\n“We are continually exploring ways to enhance the customer experience at the frontier of AI. As we dug into new ways to improve the shopping experience with AI, we were looking at how to provide natural and satisfying interactions based on the way humans interact and reason,” says Dr. Milind Naphade, SVP of Technology, AI Foundations at Capital One. “We wanted to transform the customer experience by replacing the previous generation of conversational AI technology with an agentic approach that leverages large language models (LLMs). We knew we needed to build a solution that would be able to really interact with a customer, understand their needs, and take actions on their behalf while they searched for a new vehicle.”\n\nThe result: Chat Concierge from Capital One. The proprietary multi-agentic conversational AI assistant is custom-built to enhance the experience for car buyers and dealers alike. But answering questions and organizing information is only one part of what Chat Concierge can do.\n\nModel advances have enabled the dawn of AI agents that are trained to work together and tackle a series of complex tasks. Each AI agent performs a specific duty based on the user’s request. Breaking a given workflow into discrete tasks and assigning each task to an AI agent can help ease the cognitive load of the user and create a more streamlined, satisfying experience. It’s almost like building a dream team where each member is assigned to a role fitting their strengths.\n\nWith Chat Concierge, multiple AI agents work together to not only provide information to the customer, but to take specific actions based on the customer’s preferences and needs. For example, one agent communicates with the customer. Another creates an action plan based on business rules and the tools it is allowed to use. A third agent evaluates the accuracy of the first two, and a fourth agent that explains and validates the action plan with the user.\n\nIn a single conversation, Chat Concierge can present information like vehicle comparisons and specifications, then take the next step by scheduling appointments and test drives with a sales team. “There is a complex workflow that is getting executed behind the scenes, but it’s all happening behind the scenes,” Naphade explains.\n\nThese advances come as a logical progression from generative AI to AI agents that understand their environment, make decisions, and take actions. This requires an underlying infrastructure where the data and application programming interfaces (APIs) are AI-ready. “We are standing on the shoulders of all the giant systems Capital One has built so far,” Naphade says. “For example, we are one of the only banks that has fully committed to a public cloud. The data-driven, machine learning heritage of Capital One precedes us.”\n\nThe possibilities for agentic AI–and future advances in the field–continue to evolve at a rapid clip. State of the art reasoning models are now designed to handle complex tasks by thinking through multiple steps and reasoning logically. Using these models to create AI agents brings the potential to help people turn insights into action for a range of sophisticated tasks that were never possible before. For instance, they have the potential to help solve real-world challenges like working together to tackle complex, PhD-level research problems; work with a company’s developers to autonomously support the entire software development lifecycle, from planning to deployment; or even help a new business create a business plan and financial models along with a logo, website, and marketing plans.\n\nWhile the pace of AI innovation excels, so does the need for thoughtful approaches that balance speed with risk management. Capital One has tested, learned, and adapted its multi-agentic conversational AI workflow to create a great customer experience, in real-time, while also mitigating hallucination and errors through strong guardrails.\n\nIn continuing to advance the state of the art in AI, Capital One isn’t just inventing new tools and technology. It’s delivering the right help at the right time—with intelligent, dynamically adaptive approaches—for more than 100 million customers.\n\nLearn more about AI at Capital One here.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"models\", \"experience\", \"tasks\", \"agent\", \"agentic\", \"technology\", \"help\", \"advancing\", \"insights\", \"business\", \"capital\", \"customer\", \"ai\", \"action\"]", "content_hash": "61393577a14abdc4ecaf9adca8f5ad03eb698633b0666856edc09e83117a9c39", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:51:45.806470+00:00"}

Financial institutions deal with huge sums of money every day, requiring an extraordinary degree of trust from their clients, and yet so much of this crucial decision-making is left to judgement calls and experience. Experts gather their research, draw conclusions, and make recommendations, but this process can be slow and imprecise—and all the while, fortunes hang in the balance. Overtaxed tech teams aren’t always prepared to handle every obstacle internally, and meanwhile, the work of business teams is too detailed for one-size-fits-all fixes. A field as specialized as finance demands solutions to match its complexities.\n\nWith advanced generative AI capabilities and deep institutional expertise from an experienced team, GenerativeX has already guided the pharmaceutical industry into the twenty-first century. This growing AI sophistication is now driving impact in finance, with precisely customized solutions to meet diverse needs. Instead of generic LLM assistance, GenerativeX’s AI agents are fine-tuned for financial services, informing executive strategy and eliminating tedious busywork with targeted use cases. Banking, private equity, insurance, asset management — each has room for improvement in their day-to-day. No matter the sector, no matter the business, GenerativeX’s AI agents can strengthen finance operations and recover valuable time for more effective work.\n\nIndividuality is vital in any approach to AI; its offerings must contour to the goals and workflows of a given client. AI output must take a shape that’s recognizable and useful to its intended audience: analysts can receive reports as word-processing documents or slide decks, conversational chatbots simulate in-person interactions for sales and negotiation, and higher-level ops teams can access dashboards presenting important insights at a glance. For financial institutions, being able to choose the solutions that most directly address what makes them unique creates a shorter route to success.\n\nConsider the example of mergers and acquisitions, a field poised for overhaul with the help of AI. From end to end, the compiling of proposals for target companies can be drastically condensed with AI-driven automation, with each interconnected agent executing its designated role. Once supplied with information on the companies in question, a target analysis agent generates investment hypotheses, passing them to an orchestrator agent that coordinates research, comparative analysis, valuation, and slide-deck generation agents, while incorporating iterative feedback from a human banker at every stage. In a fraction of the time required to do so manually, a full-scale proposal comes together. Action can be taken with greater confidence, new hires learn on the job more easily, and everyone saves precious time. One major global financial institution has experienced the transformative impact of GenerativeX’s M&A agent with a 30% jump in their output of individual proposals.\n\nAI agents can also carry a proposal through to execution, but M&A is only scratching the surface of what this technology can do for the world of finance. In real estate, AI can forecast the price of a designated property, automate the work of due diligence, and prepare transaction documents. For wealth management, it speeds up processes like succession planning, will preparation, and trust formation. Investment professionals benefit from AI-driven systems to screen deals, generate financial models, and garner committee support. Other use cases serve finance across various sectors, with the particulars adjusted for each specific business; compliance solutions, for one, are informed by each client’s internal policies. Trading, credit, insurance—AI services are changing the terrain everywhere, helping professionals navigate the complex world of finance with ease.\n\nAI’s usefulness in securitization shows this adaptability in full force: an analyst begins the process by engaging a specialized AI orchestrator trained on the client’s proprietary knowledge database. The orchestrator then collaborates with a trust agent to review legal agreements, identifying key structural elements—such as involved parties, account relationships, and conditional triggers. The Excel agent fully automates complex financial modeling for investment banks and private equity funds. It can seamlessly handle selecting comparables, adjusting assumptions based on market information, and automating valuations and sensitivity analyses in an end-to-end process. Traditionally, analysts spend most of their time debugging models, but the Excel agent can now perform both debugging and insight generation, allowing one financial institution to save 80% of their time—a dramatic leap in both efficiency and insight.\n\nLike any field running on data, finance involves a lot of repetitive tasks that eat up on-the-job hours without capitalizing on our human advantages. With GenerativeX’s AI solutions, we can all get these pieces of our workday back, and direct our intelligence where it’ll have a more meaningful impact. But the future of AI extends beyond streamlining and time savings to untapped new horizons of innovation in finance. Through GenerativeX’s multi-agent AI systems, users gain more leverage from their time: markets can be predicted with sharper intelligence, deals are made with less friction, and wealth goes farther. Everything’s getting smarter, and money is catching up.\n\nAnd this is just the beginning, only one instance of the optimization that AI will put within reach of other domains and industries. The AI-driven speed and certitude that keep high finance running smoothly are becoming the new general standard, a swifter cadence for conducting business.

While it’s always fun to discuss pie-in-the-sky ideas, the real question is not just what AI can do, but what it should do for your business.\n\nStartups need measurable results: better products, faster time to market, smarter customer insights, and new revenue streams. What matters most is aligning AI with these business objectives and using infrastructure that can empower you to keep up with your competition, support growth, and please customers.\n\nFrom my conversations with business leaders, the most important considerations fall into three categories:\n\nCan I do what I do today more efficiently— faster, cheaper, or with fewer resources?\n\nCan I grow my customer base faster and/or deliver more value to existing users?\n\nCan I deliver new revenue from products or services I hadn’t previously considered?\n\nThe answers to these questions should help you decide where to spend time, where to invest, and how to build AI into your business.\n\nBelow are six key areas that you and other startup founders should keep in mind as you put AI to work.\n\n1: Focus is critical\n\nFor startups, every decision matters, especially when evaluating AI choices. It’s important to make sure these investments are directly connected to business goals. Start by asking the three questions above and use the answers to help you choose the infrastructure tools needed to support your direction. In a world of distractions, focus gives you an edge. Pick tools that free up your time to solve the most important problems for your business.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages startups have today is the ability to fail fast and iterate rapidly. We’re now seeing a shift where rapid experimentation isn’t just for early-stage companies anymore. We recently worked with several customers in the core AI space that went from proof of concept to full-scale AI deployment in under three months. A year ago, that might’ve taken 12 months. Pick a cloud infrastructure partner that works the same way, enabling you to test quickly, iterate faster, and scale when you need. Focus isn’t about doing less – it’s about meeting customer needs faster.\n\n2: Change is constant\n\nThe AI landscape isn’t just evolving—it may be accelerating faster than any other technology wave in the history of mankind. And now a new phase of agentic applications is upon us. This next wave of AI workloads will be defined by thousands of agents designed to talk to each other in short bursts to perform tasks. Imagine AI agents handling your DMV registration: one handles authentication, another takes payment, and another schedules delivery – all without you clicking through 10 screens.\n\nThis shift demands a new foundation. For this to work, agents need a standard way to talk to each other and access their data sources quickly. The Model Context Protocol is important in paving the way for a wave of AI-driven agentic applications which are designed to fetch and return responses to questions with minimal human help. Many of these applications are already emerging, with broader adoption likely in the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nStartups seeking to capitalize on this shift must prioritize infrastructure that delivers real-time data access, low-latency networking, and the elasticity required to power agent-based ecosystems.\n\n3: Innovation at every layer\n\nThe rapid growth of AI is driven by innovation across the entire stack, not only in the latest silicon, but in computer science techniques governing how LLMs work. Understanding this full range of innovation is crucial for staying ahead.\n\nTake KV caching, which is the ability to reuse previous calculations for inferencing instead of recalculating everything at every step. This has the ability to save time, compute power, and money—essential factors for startups. Then there’s the Mixture of Experts technique that allows LLMs to break down complex problems and delegate each piece of the puzzle to the model—and associated infrastructure—best suited to handle it. For example, some tasks might be best served at lower cost if they run through CPUs rather than pricier GPUs. That is true for jobs relying on structured data originating in relational databases and applications, like Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, that run on them.\n\nWhen a business’s AI stack is optimized across layers, from data to model to compute, it can gain both efficiency and flexibility. This kind of innovation builds over time, and it starts with choosing infrastructure designed to support it.\n\n4: Data remains core\n\nApplications change all the time, but one thing remains constant: their reliance on large volumes of data, often in varying formats depending on the use case. As AI evolves toward more agentic and autonomous systems, the amount of data generated and consumed is growing exponentially. The more these systems interact, the more important it is to keep data close to where it’s being processed.\n\nIn many cases that means placing data as close as possible to required LLMs to minimize round trips that sap network performance. With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), storage, compute, and models live side-by-side, helping to remove performance bottlenecks and maximize throughput.\n\nSupporting AI workloads effectively while staying cost-efficient requires using a range of storage types tailored to different stages of the data lifecycle. OCI offers high-performance file systems like File Storage with Lustre for training large models, Object Storage for managing unstructured data, and Archive Storage for long-term retention, all designed to meet the price performance demands of AI-driven architectures.\n\nOracle brings decades of experience managing mission-critical data into our autonomous data platform. With OCI, startups can:\n\nSeamlessly integrate advanced LLMs from a variety of providers or create your own\n\nParlay insights from Oracle Cloud Fusion Applications to feed their models\n\nTap directly into data from Oracle Database without additional integration overhead\n\nFaster, direct access to the data not only enables improved system performance but also lays the foundation for quicker, more informed decision-making.\n\n5: Commoditization continues\n\nThe path of technological evolution is clear: hardware horsepower rises as the price for that power is stabilizing. That trend will continue and, as noted before, innovation around the improved technology will carry on as well.\n\nAs a startup, take advantage of that commoditization and the flexibility it enables, without losing track of the problem you’re solving. What’s the value proposition, and how can cloud-powered AI help you build on it?\n\nThe right infrastructure foundation should support the pace without forcing trade-offs between cost, performance, and simplicity.\n\n6: Be on the lookout for net-new business\n\nKeeping your eye on the prize is critical but it doesn’t mean wearing blinders. AI is not just a tool enabling optimization—it can be a catalyst to discover completely new ideas.\n\nWhile your business goals and product roadmap are being advanced, it’s important to stay alert to new opportunities that AI might surface. These may be in adjacent areas or perhaps crop up out of the blue in some orthogonal way.\n\nTake a startup helping restaurants optimize staffing schedules. The original product is simple: use past data and forecasts to reduce overstaffing and minimize staff burnout. But over time, its AI models started surfacing that demand surges don’t match historical foot traffic. Digging deeper, the startup realized the spikes correlate with local events, weather shifts, and even social media trends about specific menu items. That insight turns into a new product altogether: a hyperlocal demand prediction API, not just for restaurants but for brands, delivery platforms, or anyone trying to forecast foot traffic and purchasing behavior. That’s not an iteration – that’s a new category creation. And it happened by noticing a signal no one was looking for.\n\nThese are the kinds of opportunities AI can unlock, helping to move from cost savings to net-new revenue and long-term business value. That’s the real potential of deploying AI with purpose: not just automation, but meaningful growth.\n\nSpeed Alone Isn’t Enough\n\nWith so much innovation across infrastructure, models, and applications, it’s easy to get caught up in chasing the newest thing. Startups are inclined to move fast and test boundaries, but sustainable impact comes from knowing where to focus.\n\nThe question is not whether to adopt AI, but where to apply it. Every initiative needs to tie back to a clear objective, whether it’s improving efficiency, accelerating customer growth, or creating new revenue. Startups that stay grounded in practical outcomes and align with the right partners are most likely to lead the next wave of innovation.\n\nSuccess in AI won’t be about who moves first, but who moves with purpose, concentrates on the right problem, and makes sure the infrastructure, data, and models are aligned to solve it.\n\nBuild, train, and deploy AI at scale with OCI’s powerful, cost-effective infrastructure.

Not only did he willed interests from 80 potential investors for its specialty in compostable solutions, some of them flew in Hong Kong for due diligence and see if there are even more potential for the biodegradable materials applied beyond the use in disposable medical, hygiene, and personal care products.\n\nThe unforgettable experience dubbed “once in a lifetime” by Eddie himself, offering invaluable insights that significantly changed OKOsix’s trajectory, refining plans to scale manufacturing, and adapting to global demand – this realignment allowed him to adjust fundraising strategies to prioritize growth stages. Eddie also expressed gratitude for the time spent with four other startup founders. “Their businesses are much more mature than mine,” he said, “and became a kind of guidance and inspiration for me.” The sentiment extends to the local community in more ways than one, ultimately leading to the recruitment of their new Chief Innovation Officer with a doctorate in chemistry at Stanford University, and financial advisors each chiming in respective expertise.\n\nSaid with amusement, “I still remember the looks on other countries’ startup representatives when they learned about our programme, astounded and envious in equal measure!”\n\nEven the Intangible Gains are Off the Charts\n\nGoGoChart serves a diverse range of enterprise customers across various industries, notably mobile gaming and finance, with an impressive portfolio boasting over 2,000 clients, GoGoChart has distinguished itself as a pioneering provider of strategies and solutions in digital marketing.\n\nThe app had its visibility optimized and conversions driven by strong online presence, tinkering with strategic boosts, algorithms for ranking, ratings, keywords, and store listings, the list goes on. Though, competition in the field remains tough nonetheless, the solution carried spotlight as a rising star in startup awards from both Deloitte and Financial Times. Given its track record, participating in the programme was a logical step for GoGoChart, empowering them to expand into the US market.\n\nWhile this visit was not his first, Daniel Lo, CEO of GoGoChart found an even deeper connection with the business culture and community this time. Described as one of those awakening moments, he delved deeply into engaging with locals, and gaining a profound understanding of how the ecosystem operates.\n\nLo recounted: “Each day began with an early morning start, Plug and Play curated a packed schedule of sessions with mentors and investors, so we get to make the most of our time together. Dinners often featured engaging conversations with individuals from various professional backgrounds. As night fell on the West Coast, a new day began in Hong Kong; we founders worked late into the morning to stay on the line with our teams.”\n\nHe further explained that weekends often presented with unique opportunities for their professional networks to flourish. “We’d invite our new connections back to our place for a bite and get-togethers, strengthening trusts and bonds.” he said.\n\nDespite setbacks and rejections, the networking effort ultimately paid off handsomely when Lightspeed Venture Partners, a prominent multi-stage venture capital firm, invited GoGoChart to conduct a health check on the digital marketing strategies of their portfolio companies, and from there, GoGoChart has demonstrated remarkable growth at a compound rate.\n\n“I had the privilege of braving the unknown alongside my fellow founders in Silicon Valley,” Lo still recalled with excitement. “One particularly memorable moment was when we boldly decided to cold-pitch venture capitalists at a café in Menlo Park – a hub for these investors to congregate and share their insights.”\n\n“Perhaps the least tangible – yet most rewarding thing – was the opportunity to surround myself with the world’s brightest minds, which only served to make me humbler and more cognizant of the importance of hard work, perseverance, and a commitment to lifelong learning.” he reflected.\n\nThe Global Booster Programme has been hailed as a transformative experience to empower startups in breaking new grounds while fostering their founders’ personal growth, as an epitome of values HKSTP holds at heart, the “booster bunch” for the second cohort is now ready to fly from the city to markets around the world, entrepreneurship will no longer perceived as a solo journey, but an exploration odyssey.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"global\", \"silicon\", \"eddie\", \"hong\", \"valley\", \"kong\", \"startup\", \"venture\", \"startups\", \"months\", \"growth\", \"investors\", \"strategies\", \"metamorphosis\", \"programme\", \"founders\", \"gogochart\"]", "content_hash": "94f2633ecd6aad90f32d5d68e27f700f54791d743529a88d57a36dfca4bb4380", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:51:53.227092+00:00"}

The Faroe Islands Space Program is redefining exploration by harnessing the Moon’s gravitational pull to generate clean, predictable tidal energy. With 80% of global energy still derived from fossil fuels, the need for sustainable alternatives has never been more urgent. Tidal energy, with a global potential of 650 GW, remains vastly underutilized, yet could play an important part of the future energy mix. By leveraging the ocean’s natural rhythms, this initiative challenges traditional views on space exploration and highlights the need to make the most of the resources we already have.\n\n“We estimate there are at least 3000 more “Faroe Islands” out there qualifying for our space program – if they all join, moon energy could replace all coal power capacity currently under development globally”, says Martin Edlund, CEO of Minesto, one of the initiators of the Faroe Islands Space Program.\n\nLuna 12 is turning the tide for renewable energy\n\nFor the past year, global industry leader SKF, ocean energy developer Minesto, and one of the world’s smallest national energy companies, Sev, have been piloting Luna 12— a cutting-edge tidal kite designed to harness the Moon’s gravitational pull for predictable, renewable tidal energy off the coast of the Faroe Islands. Luna 12 is the first mega-watt kite at a capacity of 1.2 MW – enough to power 200 homes annually, no matter the weather. Following its success, the partners have demonstrated that tidal energy can be both cost-competitive and scalable—unlocking a powerful, untapped resource that could reshape the future of clean energy.\n\nNow, as operations in the Faroe Islands transition to the next phase, SKF and Minesto are launching the Faroe Islands Space Program. The next goal of the program is to implement a 200 MW tidal energy array, supporting the small island nation’s goal of 100% renewable energy by 2030. Once operational, the facility could supply 40% of the territory’s expected electricity needs, delivering clean, reliable energy to its 50,000 residents and 70,000 sheep in this remote North Atlantic archipelago.\n\nHow SKF and Minesto are engineering innovation for a sustainable future\n\nSince its founding in 1907, SKF has been at the forefront of innovation in bearings, seals, condition monitoring systems, lubrication systems, and related services—all designed with one primary goal: reducing friction. With applications spanning over 40 industries, these technologies play a crucial role in fighting friction and improving efficiency. Research shows that 20 percent of all energy consumed globally is used to overcome friction. By minimizing it, we can optimize resource use, particularly in energy production, where every unit generated should contribute to the power grid rather than being lost to friction.\n\n“Imagine a future powered by the tides of the Moon. This unique project dares to dream big and is exploring the potential of renewable tidal energy. At SKF we are proud to be a part of this down-to-earth project that aligns with our values and our ambition to create a more sustainable world,” says Annika Ölme, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of SKF.\n\nTethered to the seabed at a depth of ~50 meters and operating at speeds of 16 knots, the 12-meter-long (39.4-foot) Luna 12 kite withstands extreme forces, demanding precise engineering for smooth, controlled movement and durability. SKF was brought on board by Minesto to design the bearing and sealing systems for its rudders and elevators, optimizing performance under harsh conditions. Using advanced software, SKF also calculates bearing lifespan and CO2 emissions, helping engineers balance technical efficiency with sustainability. This initiative clearly shows how collaboration across industries is essential for progress. ”Together with Minesto, we are demonstrating how technology and innovation can drive the transition to renewable energy”, says Annika Ölme.\n\nWhy renewable and predictable moon energy is important for the Faroe Islands\n\nThe Moon’s gravitational pull is responsible for approximately 70% of tidal movement, making tidal energy, in essence, ‘moon energy’. Unlike solar, wind, and hydro power, which fluctuate with the weather, tidal energy is 100% predictable as it depends on the Moon’s orbit, which remains stable over long timescales. This predictability makes tidal energy a uniquely reliable renewable source.\n\nThe Faroe Islands’ slow-moving underwater currents pose a challenge for traditional tidal power systems, which struggle to generate sufficient energy in such conditions. This makes the region an ideal test site for Luna 12, a tidal kite designed to operate efficiently in low-flow environments. Using hydrodynamic lift, Luna 12 propels itself through ocean currents like a wind kite. Its autonomous control system steers it in a figure-eight trajectory, significantly increasing the speed of water flow through its turbine—allowing it to generate energy even in areas where conventional turbines fall short.\n\nSev, the Faroese municipally owned energy company, is actively supporting tidal energy development and has built key infrastructure to integrate Luna 12 into the electrical grid. With abundant natural resources and predictable tides, this project could play a crucial role in the Faroe Islands’ goal of achieving 100% renewable energy by 2030. “We believe that tidal power may prove to become a vital part of this journey,” says Hákun Djurhuus, CEO of the Faroese electricity company Sev.\n\nThe Faroe Islands Space Program highlights how knowledge-sharing and collaboration drive sustainability, showcasing tidal energy’s vast untapped potential in the renewable energy landscape. It underscores the importance of leveraging existing natural resources to build a cleaner, more resilient energy future.\n\nFor more information on this project, please click here.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"staying\", \"skf\", \"tidal\", \"minesto\", \"renewable\", \"harnesses\", \"energy\", \"space\", \"earth\", \"12\", \"moons\", \"program\", \"power\", \"islands\", \"faroe\"]", "content_hash": "5d5a65195848aeb1d726e43613251f0735a0b084fd42fbb1688d8d192de0ac0b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:51:54.688006+00:00"}

Hire scrappy, commercially minded, smart people, and you’re 80% of the way there.\n\nThiagarajan: On the business side, what are some of the problems Modal is solving?\n\nBernhardsson: Customers want to focus on what they’re good at, which is training models or building great consumer experiences, while we handle all the scaling, infrastructure management, provisioning, and containerization. Take one of our customers, Suno. Instead of hiring a massive team to manage their infrastructure, they use Modal. We handle the compute, the scaling, and the deployment, so they can focus on their core product. Our biggest value proposition to customers is that their engineers can move faster with Modal. They don’t have to build and maintain their own platform or worry about capacity planning. With Modal, developers who are using generative AI to create new applications, such as those used to compose music or design novel protein structures, can access a platform that delivers fast and reliable GPUs. With Modal using OCI AI infrastructure, developers building on Modal can ship code, get their data and AI models into production, and test applications much faster. Customers, especially AI startups also love our serverless business and pricing model that makes it easy for them to get started with a small team and build something really cool without breaking the bank.\n\nThiagarajan: Can you share details about why you chose OCI and how its helping Modal solve problems for customers?\n\nBernhardsson: We’ve been very impressed with the hardware and the fact that Oracle offers bare metal instances, along with super-fast networking, disk and CPUs, and then the GPUs themselves, of course. OCI’s bare metal instances have been phenomenal at delivering value for our customers. We can provide the capacity our customers need, often with very short lead times. But beyond that, the agility of Oracle’s sales process has been a game changer. If I need to do a large scale out of my GPU environment, I can literally text someone and get them provisioned quickly. That kind of flexibility and partnership is rare.\n\nThiagarajan: AI infrastructure is getting crowded. How do you see the market? Where does OCI fit in, and how do you differentiate?\n\nBernhardsson: I think what Oracle is doing extremely well is managing the hardware, the compute, the data centers, and doing that at a massive scale. Modal, on the other hand, is focused on the developer experience. We provide a serverless platform with clean APIs, Python SDKs, and instant execution. It’s a different part of the stack. There’s plenty of room for multiple players in this space. OCI AI infrastructure provides the raw power, and we make it easy for developers to access and scale it without friction.\n\nThiagarajan: Everyone’s talking about AI, but what’s underreported or overlooked?\n\nBernhardsson: I think audio and music are interesting. Historically, music tech has often been ahead of the curve—whether it was the gramophone, MP3s, or music streaming. Big shifts in technology tend to show up in music before spreading to other areas. We’ve seen a lot of AI applications already, but I still feel like we’re very early in understanding where this is all going. Fast forward 10 or 20 years and I think AI-generated music and audio will be far beyond where we are today. It’s exciting to watch because I think there’s a lot of untapped potential that people aren’t talking about as much as other AI breakthroughs.\n\nThiagarajan: What broader AI trends do you find interesting?\n\nBernhardsson: One of the most exciting shifts is the realization that AI breakthroughs don’t have to rely on massive compute budgets. It’s been a little frustrating for me as someone with a math, computer science, and physics background because I want to believe in small, lean, scrappy teams solving very hard problems. Major breakthroughs weren’t capital-limited—they were driven by lean teams making clever innovations. A small, smart team that’s focused can also make a lot of progress. If AI is going to break through and change this world, we need it to be available to small teams. There are very few technological breakthroughs in the past where capital was the limiting factor, right? It’s often small teams with innovative, clever applications that drive things.\n\nThiagarajan: I think the point you’re illustrating is that continuous innovation can mean finding creative ways to use hardware to get the same outcome a lot more efficiently, right?\n\nBernhardsson: Exactly. We’re going to see a major shift toward efficiency in AI infrastructure. If we look back 15 or even 10 years ago, you didn’t need a billion dollars to make a breakthrough. But now you need it. Over the next 10–15 years, I expect AI training costs to drop by orders of magnitude as we refine models, improve algorithms, and develop efficient hardware. We still have a long way to go, and AI training is wildly inefficient compared to the human brain. There’s so much room for improvement, and that’s where the next wave of innovation will come from.\n\nOCI helps startups like Modal scale AI faster—without breaking the bank.

Coral reefs have been suffering from the destruction of the marine ecosystem with climate change, pollutants, and overharvesting. Archireef, which came along in 2020, is pioneering the restoration.\n\n\n\nFounded in Hong Kong, Archireef introduced a new use for terracotta clay and made the world’s first 3D-printed Reef Tiles™ that gives a chance to hold off the damage and wins championship in the Elevator Pitch Competition (EPIC) 2021.\n\n\n\nLast year alone, EPIC put over 600 entries of international innovators from 47 economies in one spot, as the largest tech event in Hong Kong, it’s destined for “growth” to soar from there.\n\n\n\nSince then, widespread recognition has brought Archireef to the Middle Eastern coast, with backing from Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) secured, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the region, the partnership has not only meant capital but has also large-scale production of end-to-end eco-engineering solutions is able to steer the company towards global expansion in marine conservation and managing nature risks in the oceans.\n\nThat explains the growing client base of the nature-risk management company, local and international corporations including Swire Bulk, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), AD Ports Group, Sino Group and Chow Sang Sang, all contributing to climate resilience and biodiversity recovery in mitigating long-term risks and costs.\n\nDigital Health Tech Potential in Applying to be Physicians Assistants\n\nImagine a group of data scientists huddled over in Silicon Valley and come up with yet another adaptation of AI – pretty much how Leapstack was founded back in 2016. By leveraging AI and machine learning, its platform can be trained to analyze claimant data and provide personalized recommendations, insurers across countries are able to streamline claim processes and optimize policies.\n\n\n\n“We aspired to become to go-to for health insurance players around the world.” Cole Gu, Co-founder and CEO of Leapstack says, fully aware of the obstacles where Insurtech is not a one-size-fit-all with risk scenarios, compliance and regulatory vary from country to country.\n\n\n\nA eureka moment doesn’t guarantee success if it lacks investment opportunities or partnership support – exactly what EPIC offers, to put the misery to the often dire situation for startups to get their ideas off the ground.\n\n\n\n“Once the match between startups and their support system hit it off, it’s all smooth sailing from there.” would be outright a dream too good to be true. Following Leapstack’s participation in EPIC 2023 all the way to the semifinals, they’ve continued evolving into a leading digital healthcare platform in Asia with a strong presence in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, and its origin, Mainland China, going from mere coverage in Shanghai, to taking on nearly one-third of social medical insurance fund monitoring projects in the market, had them becoming a trusted service provider for claim management systems of top-tier international health insurers including Manulife and AIA in the Chinese society, leveraging cutting-edge AI to reshape the health insurance value chain and connect stakeholders.\n\n\n\nThat earned more than a ticket but an invitation from HKSTP to join its Elite programme, exclusive for those that show potential to head for global markets, the three-year milestone-based funding initiative consist of expert guidance, funding support, as well as comprehensive go-to-market strategies for more, according to Gu, “a presence in the Hong Kong market itself is a defining moment for us. We’re drawn to Hong Kong’s sound regulatory environment and strong global reputation in the insurance and reinsurance markets. Use cases that can be easier in adapting to other emerging markets also helped making this rather easy call operating in Hong Kong.”\n\n\n\nNot to mention that Hong Kong boasts the highest global insurance penetration rate and the second-highest insurance density, solidifying its position as an Insurtech innovation hub, despite its relatively small population of 7.5 million.\n\n\n\nLeapstack also embarked on another rewarding international journey led by HKSTP, “In January, we participated in the ‘Think Business, Think Hong Kong’ event in Jakarta, Indonesia to explore opportunities across Asia, ” notes Gu on his observations, “Customers in emerging markets are increasingly aware of their health protection gaps and purchasing coverage as a result.” and prior to that, Leapstack joined the delegation visiting the UAE last year to meet with local technical partners, industry leaders and regulatory bodies, extending the experience of international support.\n\nEpic Traction for Tech and Talent\n\nThese inspiring stories are part of the reason EPIC kept going and announced its 9th edition will be competing for an investment pool of 100 million and cash prize of $240,000 in three tech tracks – Digital Health Tech, Green Tech, FinTech. A global open call for innovators has just appeared on the radar, and finalists from all corners will be flown to cruise terminal in Hong Kong for the finale to unfold in November.\n\n\n\nNot just any competition. essence of the event is to break something, of borders, of sectors, of limits – if past years were any indication, anticipation for outreaching overseas should only build from now on for EPIC 2025, open calling global registration until 17 June 2025, 23:59 (GMT +8) – it’s about time to make your own EPIC story, visit epic.hkstp.org to learn more.\n\n\n\nInnovators emerging from stealth mode need to be seen.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"kongs\", \"global\", \"hong\", \"international\", \"ambition\", \"tech\", \"kong\", \"pitch\", \"epic\", \"competition\", \"markets\", \"support\", \"launchpad\", \"insurance\", \"health\", \"investment\", \"elevator\"]", "content_hash": "c1a67ab47465d80e3680611c9789d7d413dbc1d3aadf69ecb2b691b02678cf04", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:01.959179+00:00"}

He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nGoogle is readying its next set of hardware announcements, and has already confirmed that the Pixel 10 series is launching this month. We even know what two of the phones look like, thanks to official teasers from Google.\n\nBut beyond the few tidbits Google has shared officially, there’s an awful lot more we think we know about the Pixel 10 line thanks to leaks, from which phones are arriving — likely the 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold — to camera changes, US prices, and maybe even some long overdue Qi2 support.\n\nWhat we know officially\n\nLet’s start with some stone-cold facts. We know that the Pixel 10 line will be announced at a Made by Google event in New York on August 20th, where the company will show off “the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more.”\n\nWe also know that one of the phones in the lineup will look like the image above, including that blue-gray finish. Color aside, that phone looks almost identical to the Pixel 9 Pro, right down to the flash and temperature sensor inside the camera bar, confirming that Google isn’t changing its design language.\n\nYou can also see a little more of it in action in this early ad, which doesn’t miss the excuse to dunk on Apple for its repeated Apple Intelligence delays.\n\nWe’ve had a pretty similar tease for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which mostly shows that the foldable a) comes in the same grayish color as the other model, and b) otherwise looks an awful lot like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\nThat’s about all Google has said for certain, but here’s everything else we’re expecting to see at the launch later this month.\n\nTriple cameras all around\n\nThe biggest surprise this year appears to be a move to upgrade the base Pixel 10 to a triple rear camera, including a telephoto lens for the first time, bringing it in line with the three Pro models.\n\nBut before you get too excited, know that there are some downsides. To offset the added cost — and perhaps to give you a reason to consider the upgrade to the Pro — Google will reportedly downgrade the Pixel 10’s other cameras.\n\nAndroid Authority reports that Google is using smaller sensors for the Pixel 10’s main camera and ultrawide than the Pixel 9 had, meaning the cameras will capture less light. In fact, it will apparently use the same sensors it did on the Pixel 9A. That means that unless Google has made improvements elsewhere, the Pixel 10’s main and ultrawide cameras will be worse than on the 9, but offset by the addition of the telephoto lens. At least the selfie camera should remain unchanged.\n\nIt also means the triple cameras on the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL — which will apparently be unchanged from the 9 Pro models — could be superior to the 10 across the board. The 10 Pro Fold camera will be comparable to the 10’s, using the same sensors for its main and telephoto shooters, and similarly specced ones for the selfie and ultrawide. That represents a very slight upgrade to the main camera in the Fold, but the base 10 is the only model getting a real camera overhaul.\n\nContrasting colors\n\nGoogle may also be making unexpected decisions about the phones’ colors, going by allegedly official renders leaked by Android Headlines.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 4 The Pixel 10 colors look especially bright this year. Image: Android Headlines\n\nOn the base Pixel 10 that means brighter colors than ever (and confirmation of that triple camera). The site reports that the phone will come in “Obsidian,” Google’s standard black finish, along with a vibrant blue called “Indigo,” a paler shade called “Frost,” and an almost fluorescent green dubbed “Limoncello.”\n\nBy contrast, the Pro models look muted. The 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL come in the same “Obsidian” black, plus the returning “Porcelain” white, a soft green called “Jade,” and a gray-blue called “Moonstone.” You might recognize that shade from Google’s official image up at the top.\n\nStranger are the colors for the 10 Pro Fold. Android Headlines reports that it only comes in two variants, but unlike last year those aren’t black and white. Instead, the Fold will apparently only be available in “Moonstone” and “Jade,” making it the rare phone to not launch in black at all.\n\nFor more confirmation of those colors, another leaked image from the Play Store shows the full Pixel 10 lineup with the three Pro models all in “Moonstone” and the regular 10 in “Indigo.” Leaker Evan Blass has also shared multiple images of all the phones in two separate collections of leaked images on X.\n\nSeeing them together really highlights how bright the base model is compared to the Pros. Image: Android Authority\n\nQi2 charging\n\nIn July, the Wireless Power Consortium announced Qi2 25W, a faster version of the magnetic wireless charging standard, and promised support from “major Android smartphones.” We think that means the Pixel 10 line.\n\nGoogle hasn’t supported Qi2 on its previous Pixels, but there are good reasons to think that might be about to change.\n\nThe first is that Android Authority reported in June that Google is preparing an ecosystem of magnetic Qi2 accessories under the “Pixelsnap” brand, including two chargers and a stand. This has been followed by later leaks of Pixelsnap cases with rings for magnets, and a recent image of a magnetic charging puck shared by Blass.\n\nThis sure looks like a magnetic wireless charger. Image: evleaks\n\nThat latter leak is arguably the most important. While it had previously been thought that Google might follow Samsung in certifying its phones Qi2 Ready, meaning they would support Qi2 charging but not contain the magnets, this image shows a charger attaching magnetically to the phone itself, which implies full Qi2 support, magnets and all.\n\nFor more evidence of that, we have the size of the new handsets. Android Headlines claims to have the official dimensions and weights of all four phones, and each is heavier than the previous generation, and all but the XL are thicker, too.\n\nThis could just be because the phones will have bigger batteries, which several reports have suggested. But Google could also be making space for the magnets required to enable Qi2 support.\n\nThe first IP68 foldable\n\nOne rumor that’s circulated for a while is that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first foldable phone to pack an IP68 rating.\n\nBy comparison, Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Motorola Razr Ultra both have IP48 ratings. That means they’re protected against objects larger than 1mm, but the 10 Pro Fold bumps that up to complete protection against dust and particulates — the highest possible rating for dust protection on the IP scale — while maintaining a high water-resistance rating too.\n\nSo far, no foldable phone has achieved that level of dust and particle protection, whether sold in the US or otherwise, suggesting that this has involved a pretty impressive feat of engineering on Google’s part to protect the phone’s delicate mechanisms entirely.\n\nChip upgrades\n\nBoring, I know — every phone, every year, has a chipset upgrade. But we are expecting more from Google this time around.\n\nAndroid Authority has repeatedly reported that for the new Tensor G5 chip Google is moving manufacturing from Samsung to TSMC, using the same 3nm N3E process Apple uses for the iPhone 16 Pro’s A18 Pro chip. Together with some tweaks to the core layout, that’s expected to produce a significant boost in processing power, closing the gap between Pixels and the competition.\n\nAI everywhere\n\nAndroid Authority reports that Google is developing several new AI imaging features, though some may be for next year’s Pixel 11. “Sketch-to-Image” will be the Pixel version of a feature already seen on Samsung phones, while “Speak-to-Tweak” should be a voice-based photo editing tool. The latter has more recently been reported by Android Headlines, which claims you’ll be able to use voice prompts for simple edits like “changing backgrounds, brightening images, or removing objects.”\n\nAndroid Headlines reports that a new AI feature called “Camera Coach” will use Gemini to advise you as you’re taking shots, giving advice on adjusting camera angles or lighting to get a better photo before you take it.\n\nAndroid Authority has also reported that the Pixel 10 will have a new virtual assistant called “Pixel Sense,” once rumored to be called “Pixie.” Pixel Sense will reportedly use information from other Google apps to complete tasks across your phone, make predictive suggestions to help you before you ask, and better learn your tastes from all that data. Impressively, that will all be processed on-device.\n\nIt sounds like a more powerful version of the multimodal actions Google added to Gemini in January, but going by the name, it sounds like a Pixel exclusive.\n\nThe Pixel 10 software will look a little different to before. Image: Google\n\nThese AI features should arrive alongside Android updates we’ve known about since Google I/O, like the big Material 3 Expressive redesign and a desktop mode based on Samsung’s DeX.\n\nFamiliar prices and a late Fold\n\nIf you’re worried that it sounds like Google hasn’t made many outright hardware upgrades this year, you may be reassured by news that they’re probably not changing their prices either. A leak from Android Headlines includes the alleged US pricing for all four phones, and it’s almost identical to last year’s.\n\nPer rumors, the Pixel 10 will start at $799 for 128GB of storage, or $899 for 256GB. The 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB, rising all the way up to $1,449 for a 1TB option.\n\nThe two larger phones could be the only models with price changes. The 10 Pro XL may see a price bump from $1,099 to $1,199, but that’s only because Google has scrapped the phone’s 128GB option, starting at 256GB instead — and matching the 9 Pro XL’s pricing at that and higher storage tiers.\n\nMeanwhile, the 10 Pro Fold may stick with a $1,799 starting price for 256GB of storage, but the leak suggests Google is adding a new 1TB option at $2,149.\n\nThe Fold may also go on sale separately from the other phones. A report from WinFuture, since echoed by Evan Blass, claims that due to “supply chain problems,” the Fold won’t go on sale until October 9th. The Pixel Watch 4 and Buds 2A will reportedly be late too, while the other three phones could hit stores on August 28th.\n\nUpdate, August 14th: Added new Google ad revealing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, a link to a recent leak of Pixelsnap phone cases, and rumors of an IP68 rating for the Fold.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"camera\", \"know\", \"phone\", \"image\", \"google\", \"pixel\", \"pro\", \"fold\", \"think\", \"phones\", \"android\", \"qi2\"]", "content_hash": "9df06a2c09024f35759cedfd51ba99f4ef2648e9ef4f3ccbfacbf969b6e2d406", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:06.499058+00:00"}

In recent years, big tech companies have inserted themselves into debates over both. They lobby lawmakers and regulators, and they are pitching their own pricing schemes to challenge those of utilities — something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.\n\nThat has led to growing tensions.\n\nThe utilities pay for grid projects over decades, typically by raising prices for everyone connected to the grid. But suddenly, technology companies want to build so many data centers that utilities are being asked to spend a lot more money a lot faster. Lawmakers, regulators and consumer groups fear that households and smaller companies could be stuck footing these mounting bills.\n\nFor utilities, working with technology companies can be difficult but also lucrative.\n\nStates allow utilities to charge customers enough to recoup their costs and make money for shareholders based on how much they invest. New data centers require utilities to spend billions of dollars on power lines and plants, which should lead to bigger profits for the utilities over time.\n\n“My No. 1 priority in all of this is to keep the lights on,” said Calvin Butler, the chief executive of Exelon, a large utility company, and the chairman of Edison Electric Institute, an industry association. “I think the tech companies’ being engaged in our industry makes this a very exciting time.

She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.\n\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.\n\nBudget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.\n\nWhat I’m looking for How we test Collapse There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless. Strong software support Collapse At least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There’s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches. A good screen Collapse Since you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone’s screen is one place you shouldn’t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today’s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens; however, for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn’t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate. Serviceable storage space Collapse If you plan to hang onto your phone for a while, you’ll want enough storage space to accommodate all the system files, photos, and videos you’ll accumulate over the years. Ideally, you’ll get at least 128GB built in. One good rear camera, not four mediocre ones Collapse Upgrades like telephoto cameras and optical image stabilization are rare in the under-$500 class, but you can still expect good, basic performance in good lighting from any modern smartphone. Low light is trickier. Phones in this class should offer a night mode to help with non-moving subjects in very dim light. And there are no bonus points awarded for adding extra macro and depth cameras to pad out the rear camera array — those 2- and 5-megapixel sensors are pretty much useless.\n\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.\n\nThe best cheap iPhone\n\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\n\nIf I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\n\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\n\nThe iPhone 16E features a single 48-megapixel camera. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\n\nThe best Android phone under $500\n\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\n\nGoogle’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right.\n\nThe phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.\n\nThe 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.\n\nThe budget phone with a big, beautiful screen\n\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65\n\nThe OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.\n\nThere’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.\n\nOther budget phones to consider\n\nUpdate, August 15th: Updated pricing / availability and added a bullet for the Galaxy A36 5G.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nI know my way around a pair of joysticks — but I’d prefer to soar. I don’t want to think about filming while I’m flying. I’d rather explore.\n\nNow, camera maker Insta360 is launching its first drone, under a new drone company, to serve that exact demand. It’s called Antigravity, and in January 2026, it’ll ship a flying 360-degree camera which — unlike today’s drones — will always come bundled with goggles that put you inside its virtual cockpit.\n\nIt looks and flies a bit like a DJI Mini, with similar folding arms and sub-250-gram weight, but the experience of using the new Antigravity A1 is totally different. Like the Hover X1, which ditched controllers entirely, it feels like Antigravity might have just unlocked a whole new category of drone.\n\nBecause it has a 360-degree camera, you can fly up into the sky, or through a park, and simply turn your head to look in any direction. You don’t have to fly straight at things you want to see or aim a camera. And because it’s recording 8K footage in every direction simultaneously, you can direct an entire video, with virtual zooms and pans and spins, long after your flight is finished.\n\nOn the sunny day I flew a prototype in a Northern California park, I remember seeing a few birds fly by. But reviewing my footage weeks later, I discovered I’d filmed an entire flock — over 40 in all, when I pan and zoom my virtual camera and take the time to count. Check out my embedded video to see what I’m talking about.\n\nPrevious Next\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 12 The controller’s buttons mostly do what you’d expect, but the slider on the left is for takeoff and landing, and the horizontal wheel lets you rotate the drone in place without turning your head. Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge\n\nDon’t get me wrong, it’s still a drone, and it’s still a 360-degree camera, with inherent limitations of both. While it’s quieter than some, I still wouldn’t want its noisy blades spinning through the middle of my wedding party, even if I’d appreciate having an omnidirectional recording afterwards.\n\nAnd even though it records at 8K and is aiming for similar image quality as the acclaimed Insta360 X5, 360-degree cameras spread out those pixels across an incredibly wide canvas: it’s not yet enough to zoom in on many things without a dramatic loss of image quality, or to truly immerse someone wearing a VR headset, particularly since it’s limited to 30 frames per second at that 8K resolution, or 5.7K at 60fps. (I tested my early footage in a Quest 3, and you can check it out on YouTube 360.)\n\nSo for best results, you won’t want to fly high above things: you’ll want to be close. But not so close that you see the stitching lines between the Antigravity A1’s top and bottom cameras. The nearly invisible stitch neatly keeps the drone’s frame from appearing in your field of view, but it’s noticeable when it artificially shortens people and objects that are perfectly level with the drone.\n\nYou can tap and drag the video above to rotate the view! Be sure to change the video quality to maximum first under the gear wheel.\n\nStill, watching my early footage was a thrilling experience, particularly because I never had to think about filming while I flew. And frankly, I didn’t need to think about flying that much, either.\n\nIn 2022, I was wowed by the new bar the DJI Avata set for beginner drones, letting me simply tilt a motion-sensing joystick and pull a trigger to feel like a pilot flying through the air, with optional goggles for a first-person view. But Antigravity’s goggles give me nearly double the field of view (roughly 90 degrees diagonally) and while its Grip controller looks similar, this one’s as easy as point and shoot. You can aim the drone to fly in an entirely different direction than you’re facing, just by pointing your controller hand that way, and get a picture-in-picture view of the direction it’s flying to help you avoid crashes. There’s also a traditional twin-stick controller in development if you prefer, as well as propeller guards.\n\nBut you should know the A1 is probably not for thrillseekers. Compared to an Avata, the prototype I tried is slow and steady, flying more like a traditional camera drone, and its front-facing obstacle sensors were very aggressive in my demo, refusing to let me easily fly under a wide-open play structure in my local park. I also hope the final version has a bit less visual artifacting and a bit stronger wireless signal than the prototype: the range and visual transmission in the headset weren’t bad, but they were definitely not up to DJI’s very high bar.\n\nNotice the drone’s automatic folding landing gear on the bottom. Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge\n\nI’m also not sure about some of the A1’s snazziest features. It’s fun to watch its landing gear automatically fold and unfold, and I’m sure my kids will get a kick out of seeing where daddy’s flying on the goggles’ external screen, but I’d probably prefer to pay less for fewer components and fewer points of failure.\n\nBy the way, I can’t tell you how fast the Antigravity A1 technically is, or how much range or battery life it claims just yet. The company isn’t releasing full specs or pricing today, and it declined my request for a full interview about how this Chinese company plans to sell it in the US at a time when DJI is experiencing a de facto ban and Trump has made it clear that US drones should “dominate.”\n\nBut spokesperson Ben Liu was willing to speak to that for a bit. He tells me that US retailers like Best Buy and Amazon have been “very welcoming” even if final contracts have yet to be signed, and that the company believes the drone will make it to the United States even though “it’s definitely a really big risk.” He admits it might have different prices in different regions due to tariffs, but that the complete package with goggles and controller should cost less than a DJI Mavic, perhaps as little as $1,300 or as high as $1,700. It shouldn’t cost $2,000, Liu says.\n\nThe bundled goggles have a built-in screen that shows what you see inside, and a camera for passthrough. Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge\n\nAlso, Insta360 claims it’s standing up Antigravity as a whole new company with its own dedicated team and its own servers in the US, and it’s working on features with the hopes of proactively showing governments that it’s not a threat. Before I finish my demo, Liu insists I try the “payload detection” feature that he claims is designed to prevent the Antigravity AI from being weaponized as a flying bomb. The drone, loaded down with many tiny metal weights, immediately forces itself to land after I make it take off.\n\n”We just want to show our attitude that this drone is only for fun,” says Liu.\n\nI don’t know if that demo proves much, as I suspect the US government would be more concerned about the Antigravity as a powerful surveillance tool since its 360-degree camera can cover more area at a time.\n\nBut for others, this fundamentally feels like a different and potentially easier way to fly and film. Even if the Antigravity A1 doesn’t wind up being a winner, I’m now convinced DJI and competitors will follow.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"antigravity\", \"camera\", \"change\", \"dji\", \"view\", \"flew\", \"drone\", \"goggles\", \"fly\", \"insta360s\", \"flying\", \"id\", \"drones\"]", "content_hash": "8255acfd66c13bb1991503449e01976c30a0fce3cd6b805c83f073064bacced1", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:11.497365+00:00"}

Both the newer AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the latest AirPods Pro with USB-C. Events like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday often bring the steepest discounts, though you can still find great deals throughout the year.\n\nBelow, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.\n\nThe best AirPods 4 deals\n\nAt its September 2024 event, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.\n\nThe $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.\n\nGiven they’ve been out for nearly a year, we consistently see discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $99 ($30 off), which is just $10 shy of their all-time low. The AirPods 4 with ANC, meanwhile, are matching their second-best price to date at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can currently pick them up starting at $148.99 (also $30 off).\n\nThe best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals\n\nIn 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features a USB-C charging case and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used with Apple’s new Vision Pro headset and doubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids.\n\nAs far as deals go, Apple’s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $169 ($80 off), which remains the best price we’ve seen this year outside of Prime Day.\n\nThe best AirPods Max deals\n\nThe AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.\n\nToward the end of last year, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. As of writing, they’re on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in all six colors for $479.99 ($70 off) — not quite the $399 low we saw during Prime Day.\n\nVerge Deals Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

Rather than go through the process of charging them one by one, a quality charging station can help you manage the chaos and reduce cable clutter. The Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station is a solid option for keeping your devices charged, and it’s currently matching its all-time low of $62.99 ($27 off) at Amazon and Anker’s online storefront — the same price drop we saw during Amazon Prime Day.\n\nThe 3-in-1 charger features a relatively compact design that’s about the size of a coffee mug. Front and center is a MagSafe / Qi2 charging pad that can quickly charge a compatible phone with an output of up to 15W. You can adjust the pad’s angle vertically up to 45 degrees, which is handy for viewing notifications or taking video calls. Just behind the main pad is a horizontal charging spot that supports fast-charging on newer Apple Watch models, including the Apple Watch Series 10, which can be charged from 0 to 100 percent in just over an hour. Additionally, the base of the charging station has a third pad for wireless earbuds.\n\nIf you decide to buy Anker’s 3-in-1 charging station, you won’t need to pick up any additional accessories to get started.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAnthropic has updated the usage policy for its Claude AI chatbot in response to growing concerns about safety. In addition to introducing stricter cybersecurity rules, Anthropic now specifies some of the most dangerous weapons that people should not develop using Claude.\n\nAnthropic doesn’t highlight the tweaks made to its weapons policy in the post summarizing its changes, but a comparison between the company’s old usage policy and its new one reveals a notable difference. Though Anthropic previously prohibited the use of Claude to “produce, modify, design, market, or distribute weapons, explosives, dangerous materials or other systems designed to cause harm to or loss of human life,” the updated version expands on this by specifically prohibiting the development of high-yield explosives, along with biological, nuclear, chemical, and radiological (CBRN) weapons.\n\nIn May, Anthropic implemented “AI Safety Level 3” protection alongside the launch of its new Claude Opus 4 model. The safeguards are designed to make the model more difficult to jailbreak, as well as to help prevent it from assisting with the development of CBRN weapons.\n\nIn its post, Anthropic also acknowledges the risks posed by agentic AI tools, including Computer Use, which lets Claude take control of a user’s computer, as well as Claude Code, a tool that embeds Claude directly into a developer’s terminal. “These powerful capabilities introduce new risks, including potential for scaled abuse, malware creation, and cyber attacks,” Anthropic writes.\n\nThe AI startup is responding to these potential risks by folding a new “Do Not Compromise Computer or Network Systems” section into its usage policy. This section includes rules against using Claude to discover or exploit vulnerabilities, create or distribute malware, develop tools for denial-of-service attacks, and more.\n\nAdditionally, Anthropic is loosening its policy around political content. Instead of banning the creation of all kinds of content related to political campaigns and lobbying, Anthropic will now only prohibit people from using Claude for “use cases that are deceptive or disruptive to democratic processes, or involve voter and campaign targeting.” The company also clarified that its requirements for all its “high-risk” use cases, which come into play when people use Claude to make recommendations to individuals or customers, only apply to consumer-facing scenarios, not for business use.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"dangerous\", \"claude\", \"policy\", \"weapons\", \"rules\", \"computer\", \"landscape\", \"using\", \"usage\", \"anthropic\", \"risks\", \"writer\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "5b351672395f76847bdb1a0a1f3d00b3f5a87ddf4c515f1d6977dcfa8071bdc4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:14.284126+00:00"}

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nApple recently announced iOS 26, the next major software update for iPhones, and it’s packed with a whole bunch of new features. The biggest change is a new design, but there are lots of smaller improvements and additions as well that could make a difference in how you use your iPhone every day.\n\nIf you want to kick the tires before the update’s wider release this fall, you can try it now in a public beta. Here’s a bit more detail on what you can expect from iOS 26 when you install it on your device.\n\nA refreshed design across the OS\n\nPhoto by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nApple has a new design language called “Liquid Glass” that it’s being introduced across all of the company’s devices, not just the iPhone. It’s inspired by the visionOS software used with Apple’s Vision Pro headset, and it features a lot of translucency that Apple says “behaves like glass in the real world.” On-screen elements now use “real-time rendering” that lets them react to movement with highlights and color shifts.\n\nI initially thought Liquid Glass was a wild change to my iPhone with some glaring problems, and Apple has tweaked the glassiness through the developer betas. Still, when you first boot up your phone on iOS 26 for the first time, it’s going to feel a little jarring.\n\nMessages is getting better for group chats\n\nPhoto by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nIn Messages, iOS 26 is adding a lot of updates that could significantly improve group chats. You’ll be able to customize the background of a chat to give it more personality. To help make group decisions or get an opinion on something, you can create polls. And, at long last, Apple is adding typing indicators to group chats, which should make them feel more lively.\n\nSome new Phone features will help you save time\n\nPhoto by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nApple is taking some cues from Google by adding a call screening feature and a “Hold Assist” feature that can wait on a call for you. The company is also adding a new unified layout option that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails all into one view.\n\nLive Translation can translate calls in real time\n\nA photo of live translation on a FaceTime call in iOS 26. Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nApple is adding an Apple Intelligence-powered feature that can translate text on your screen and translate speech back and forth in the middle of a phone call. The company is building the feature into Messages, FaceTime, and the Phone app, and Apple says its models for Live Translation run entirely on your device for privacy.\n\nSome small Apple Intelligence improvements\n\nPhoto by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nEven though we’re still waiting for Apple to announce when it will actually release its delayed improvements to Siri, iOS 26 will include some new Apple Intelligence-powered features. Visual Intelligence will let you do searches about and take action on things you see on your screen. With Genmoji, you’ll be able to combine two emoji into one. And Shortcuts will be able to use Apple Intelligence models to improve your workflows.\n\nThe new Games app is for everything about your games\n\nPhoto by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n\nApple’s new Games app will provide a centralized hub for everything about your games on your iPhone. The Home tab shows things like updates and events in your games. The Apple Arcade tab lets you browse the company’s catalog of games on the service. The Library tab shows all of the App Store games you’ve ever downloaded.

It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the 2020 laptop starting at $599 ($50 off) at Walmart — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro.\n\nPurchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.bot\n\nAlthough Macs may not get perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.\n\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\n\nThe best MacBook Air deals\n\nM1 MacBook Air\n\nThe M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while the redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air (which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in our guide to the best laptops.\n\nThe base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $599 ($50 off), which is its lowest price to date.\n\n2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB) $ 599 $ 649 8 % off $ 599 The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold). Read More $599 at Walmart\n\nM2 MacBook Air\n\nThe M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads.\n\nIt does have some slight downsides, though, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the best laptops.\n\nThe M2-powered MacBook Air from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at Best Buy starting at $699 ($100 off). B&H Photo is offering a souped up 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air with a 10-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD for $1,699 ($800 off).\n\nIt’s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15.3-inch MacBook Air M2, however. While it’s in short supply at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M4 model.\n\nM3 MacBook Air\n\nThe M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the M3 MacBook Air to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in 2024 in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port. Apple discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM last year and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.\n\nThe entry-level 13-inch M3 MacBook Air configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is tough to find in stock. However, you can get the 24GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) in select colors at Best Buy. Given the relatively small price difference between these two models, it’s great that you’re getting double the amount of internal storage and additional memory.\n\nAs for the M3-powered 15-inch MacBook Air, you can buy it with 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) at Best Buy.\n\n13-inch MacBook Air with M3 (2024) $ 1099 $ 1299 15 % off $ 1099 The MacBook Air M3 is a jack-of-all-trades, with a balanced combination of performance and power efficiency. It also now supports dual displays with the lid closed, and the storage speed is noticeably faster. You don’t need to think about if this laptop will meet your needs — it just will. Read More $1099 at Best Buy (24GB RAM, 512GB SSD)\n\nM4 MacBook Air\n\nIn March, along with an updated Mac Studio, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with a M4 processor. Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. There’s a lot to like.\n\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some good discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $799 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\n\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\n\nDuring its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October 2024, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.\n\nM3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro\n\nThe entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).\n\nThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.\n\nWe’re finding it challenging to spot the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. However, Best Buy is selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, 10-core GPU for $1,299 ($300 off). You can also grab a 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 18GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14-core GPU for $1,499 ($400 off) at Best Buy. If you need more space, you can also get a 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 18GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and 18-core GPU for $1,799 ($500 off) at Best Buy.\n\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\n\nApple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\n\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.\n\nDeals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,299 ($300 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,699 ($300 off) at Best Buy and B&H Photo.\n\nThe base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,223 ($277 off) at Amazon and $2,249 ($250 off) at Best Buy.\n\nThe best Mac Mini deals\n\nThe newest Mac Mini in town are the M4-based models which arrived late last year. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.\n\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\n\nDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\n\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit Ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit Ethernet for another $100.\n\nRight now, you can get the base Mac Mini at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for around $546 ($54 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for around $719 ($80 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\n\nMeanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale at Amazon starting at $1,255 ($144 off).\n\nVerge Deals Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

{"url": "https://www.theverge.com/23350899/nintendo-switch-controllers-best-wireless-joy-con-gamepad", "title": "The best Nintendo Switch controllers to buy right now", "authors": "[\"Quentyn Kennemer\", \"Cameron Faulkner\", \"Quentyn Kennemer Cameron Faulkner\"]", "published": "2022-09-30T13:00:00+00:00", "text": "The Nintendo Switch 2 is here, but we’re not going to forget about the original Switch. We’ve still got love for the console and its many millions of owners, so we’ll keep recommending the best controllers for the Switch right here. If you’re considering getting a Switch 2 in the future, all of the controllers below will work on the newer console.\n\nNow, you may have already realized long ago that the best Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with the console. The removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient, given they can be detached for wireless use for up to two players with a pair, but their tiny shape doesn’t do them many favors. They aren’t comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions — especially if you have large hands. And, you’re definitely not alone if you’ve experienced Joy-Con drift.\n\nIn this buying guide, we’ll focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed that may match your unique play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock here, as they’re mostly similar to each other and the savings aren’t worth giving up wireless freedom for.\n\nThere are some things that are worth knowing if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), it may not support HD rumble, motion controls, NFC for Amiibo, or be able to wake the Switch remotely. However, there are some exceptions, which we feature below.\n\nFeatured in this article\n\nWhat we’re looking for How we test Nintendo Switch controllers Collapse We test Nintendo Switch controllers by playing with them with a standard grip — the same way most gamers do. We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, racers like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and shooters like Overwatch 2. We pay attention to how everything feels — buttons, triggers, analog sticks, the D-pad — noting whether anything seems off. Connectivity Collapse Does it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz? Ideally (but not always), a controller we recommend is compatible with other platforms, too. Quality Collapse Do the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches? Extra features and customization Collapse Are there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macro settings? Can you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity? Value Collapse Is it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\n\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes (but not the Switch 2)\n\nEver since the Switch launched, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller has been the best gamepad for the console. In many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. And, it’s compatible with the Switch 2 (although it can’t wake the new console from sleep — you’ll need a Switch 2 Pro Controller for that).\n\nAside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s one of a few controllers we’ve tested (aside from the Joy-Con and 8BitDo’s Ultimate series) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.\n\nPhoto: James Bareham / The Verge\n\nThe buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, aside from Xbox and PlayStation.\n\nGiven the high price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t possible. If you really want the ability to listen via wired headphones without connecting your controller with a wire, you’ll need to get the Switch 2 and its Switch 2 Pro controller.\n\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\n\nSupported Platforms: Switch, Switch OLED / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No\n\nI’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re very comfortable. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Compact can help out.\n\nThe Split Pad Compact is a — you guessed it — a more compact alternative to the Split Pad Pro, which has unfortunately become tougher to find. Similarly, it comes in a variety of colorways, and it adds comfort to using the Switch in handheld mode. One half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides more grip than Joy-Con do, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast-paced gameplay, or to stay comfy over longer play sessions.\n\nThe Split Pad Compact fits in your Switch’s Joy-Con slots and doubles as a standalone controller with the optional attachment set. Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\n\nThe Split Pad Compact doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Compact Attachment that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment usually (but not always) costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned features. It does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however.\n\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\n\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes (only in KK3 Max) / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\n\nOn the surface, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and KingKong 3 Max are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.\n\nBut there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).\n\nAdditionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge.\n\nGuliKit’s newest Switch controllers offer ample customization. Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge\n\nThe longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.\n\nIn summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer a lot for the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.\n\nThe best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck\n\nSupported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Android, macOS, Apple devices / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable buttons: Yes, four / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes, but not Switch 2\n\n8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller is a minor step forward compared to the first iteration, but it comes with new features you might care about. It still feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. As for what’s changed internally, you’re getting more durable TMR joysticks, plus two new mappable buttons near the triggers (totaling four customizable buttons). Speaking of the triggers, they’re adjustable thanks to new switches that can alter how much you have to pull them to register an input. It’s particularly great for first-person shooters or action games where speed is paramount.\n\nIts haptics are decent in some games, but not nearly as good as Nintendo’s HD Rumble, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. It’s a nice value compared to the Switch Pro, as well as most other third-party options because it also includes a charging dock with an integrated 2.4GHz transmitter.\n\nThe Ultimate 2 controller comes in two variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model for Switch owners because it’s the only version that’s compatible. Additionally, it’s compatible with the Switch 2, the Steam Deck, PC, macOS computers, and a slew of other Bluetooth-ready devices. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity, in case you need a more reliable connection for compatible devices.\n\nAs for any control scheme tweaks you may want to make, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software V2 app on PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for great third-party controllers, and this is one of its best.\n\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\n\nSupported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, and more / Connectivity: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable buttons: Yes, four / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes, but not Switch 2\n\nThe 8BitDo Pro 3 is the company’s latest high-end controller. On its face, the biggest difference between it and the similarly-priced Ultimate 2 is its PlayStation DualShock-esque stick layout, which alone might enough to convince some gamers to get it. The Pro 3 improves on its predecessor by featuring swappable buttons that can be detached with its included magnetic suction tool. With it, you can go from the Nintendo layout to the Xbox layout. Otherwise, this model’s internal specs and compatibility are very similar to that of the Ultimate 2.\n\nThe Pro 3 features TMR joysticks, plus Hall effect triggers with switches that toggle between full pulls or shorter clicks for either trigger. Just like the Ultimate 2, the Pro 3 has four customizable buttons that can be assigned almost any other button, or combination of buttons, through the company’s Ultimate V2 app on PC or by pressing certain buttons together, as listed in the manual. Additionally, the controller supports turbo mode.\n\nCompared to most other Switch controllers, the Pro 3 stands out due to its PlayStation-style layout of D-pad and sticks. You may prefer this model if you play a lot of retro games that prioritize the D-pad, which is more easily accessible than on most other Switch controllers. One other fun perk of the Pro 3 is its swappable joystick caps. Two arcade stick-like knobs are included that make certain games feel more rewarding to play, such as fighting games.\n\nIt has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Overwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming.\n\nEach controller includes swappable arcade stick caps. Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\n\nOn its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, and DirectInput, each of which offers its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. One new addition for the Pro 3 is a charging dock that lets the controller recharge via contact pins. The dock also contains a 2.4GHz USB-C transmitter, letting you connect to some devices that route instead of Bluetooth.\n\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\n\nThere are a few other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s is the best value. Instead of spending $70 on a Switch Pro controller, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn most Bluetooth controllers you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock (or directly into the console if you have a USB-A to USB-C adapter) and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model we’ve linked to.)\n\nTo our delight, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.\n\n8BitDo’s dongle supports most Bluetooth controllers, including official Xbox and PlayStation gamepads. Image: 8BitDo\n\n8BitDo has an extensive support page that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.\n\nIf you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.\n\nOther Switch controllers we tested\n\nWe like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).\n\nWe recently tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($49.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.\n\nWe also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($44.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.\n\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nWe’ll be doing more testing on the EasySMX S10 controller, as well as the GameSir Super Nove and GuliKit’s Elves 2 and ES Pro controllers for consideration.\n\nUpdate, August 15th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability. We’ve added the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and Pro 3 controllers as new recommended options. The next update will include impressions on new EasySMX, GameSir, and GuliKit controllers.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"right\", \"nintendo\", \"console\", \"controller\", \"buy\", \"yes\", \"bluetooth\", \"best\", \"buttons\", \"pro\", \"rumble\", \"wireless\", \"switch\", \"controllers\"]", "content_hash": "6d2e35d6451ad8e3238b62edb7f2aabf9f60dda2029250a0e6c67dd7a2055ce2", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:20.710177+00:00"}

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nAs economists speculate whether the stock market is in an AI bubble that could soon burst, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has just admitted to believing we’re in one. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during a lengthy interview with The Verge and other reporters last night. “My opinion is yes.”\n\nIn the far-ranging interview, Altman compared the market’s reaction to AI to the dot-com bubble in the ’90s, when the value of internet startups soared before crashing down in 2000. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Altman said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited.”\n\nHe added that he thinks it’s “insane” that some AI startups with “three people and an idea” are receiving funding at such high valuations. “That’s not rational behavior,” Altman said. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think.” Over the past year, we’ve seen several AI startups, including Safe Superintelligence, led by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, and Thinking Machines, founded by ex-OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, raise billions of dollars.\n\n“Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money. We don’t know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money,” Altman said. “My personal belief, although I may turn out to be wrong, is that, on the whole, this would be a huge net win for the economy.”\n\nEven if we may be in an AI bubble, it seems Altman is expecting OpenAI to survive the burst. “You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,” Altman said. “You should expect a bunch of economists to wring their hands.”\n\nAdditional reporting by Alex Heath.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"openai\", \"phenomenal\", \"tech\", \"overexcited\", \"yes\", \"bubble\", \"startups\", \"sam\", \"really\", \"altman\", \"writer\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "257bb8dff45b20465bccccfef27416638165f1ccbee73b04732e8b769d898c98", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:21.705734+00:00"}
{"url": "https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview", "title": "For Legends: Z-A’s battle system, I rewired the Pokémon part of my brain", "authors": "[\"Kallie Plagge\"]", "published": "2025-08-15T13:00:00+00:00", "text": "Even if you’ve never played a Pokémon game before, you can probably figure out how the type chart works. Fire types are weak to water types, water is weak to grass, and grass is weak to fire. Type matchups are foundational to Pokémon battles, far before you get into the weeds of stats and strats. I’ve had the Pokémon type chart memorized for around 25 years.\n\nThat still didn’t stop me from making a rookie error in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. I panicked and sent out my Weedle against an NPC’s Pidgeotto, which it is very much weak to. It got one-shot, obviously.\n\nIt’s not that I forgot how type matchups worked. But the battle system in Legends: Z-A is very, very different from what I’m used to, at least with Pokémon. It’s the second entry in the Legends spinoff series, which began with 2022’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and while the Legends games are still RPGs like the main Pokémon games, they mechanically and structurally diverge a bit from the typical Pokémon formula. And Z-A takes it further than Arceus did: it’s the first Pokémon RPG to feature real-time battles instead of turn-based ones.\n\nGotta look out for Pidgeotto. Image: The Pokémon Company\n\nIn the main series, you choose your actions turn by turn, taking time to think through the options — the right attack to use, whether to switch out for another pokémon, what the opponent might be planning — before locking something in and seeing how it plays out. In Legends: Z-A, on the other hand, you’re facing your opponent more directly. There’s no waiting for both opponents to lock in their actions for the turn; you just pick your pokémon’s move using one of the face buttons, and the move goes out.\n\nIt’s a big departure from nearly 30 years of Pokémon games. I’m used to thinking about Pokémon like a chess match, slowly and several steps ahead; in Z-A, I had to think about the same type matchups and stats and everything else, but quickly and on my feet. It took me some time to adjust.\n\nThe demo, which I played ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, was split into two parts lasting around 10 minutes each, both seemingly early in the game and heavily focused on the new battle system. In the first part, I tried my hand at the Z-A Royale, which had me battling NPC trainers around Lumiose City at night. In the second, I battled a Rogue Mega Absol, which felt like the Pokémon version of a classic 3D Zelda boss. In the second part of the demo, I started to get the hang of this style of battling, and what was at first a little overwhelming quickly became an alluring kind of challenge: rewiring the Pokémon part of my brain.\n\nThe first big change I had to contend with: since battle in Z-A is in real time, moves are on cooldown timers. You can’t just spam the one super-effective move you have over and over; you have to figure out what else you can do while you wait to use that attack again. Even against very low-level opponents, I found myself relying on status moves like Growl, which lowers the opposing pokémon’s attack stat, as a buffer while my other moves were on cooldown. This had the added bonus of allowing my pokémon to take more hits, buying me some time both for the cooldown and to think.\n\nUsing status moves like this isn’t unusual when playing the core Pokémon games at a high level, but it is very unusual against a run-of-the-mill Bellsprout early in the game. I didn’t have enough time in the demo to really play around with it, but I can see myself carefully selecting each pokémon’s moves to account for the cooldown, like ensuring I have Protect on more of my pokémon to block incoming attacks. In other Pokémon games, I’d absolutely teach my pokémon Protect if I was building a competitive team, but I would almost never do it just to play the main story.\n\nImage: The Pokémon Company\n\nIt’s not that battles in Legends: Z-A are unforgiving. (I did get smoked by the Pidgeotto, but in my defense, it was also at least 10 levels higher than the pokémon on my team.) But after years and years of approaching every mainline Pokémon game the same way, operating at least a little bit on autopilot and muscle memory in the early game, it’s kind of an exciting challenge to have to look at Pokémon differently.\n\nThe battle against Rogue Mega Absol — a wild, rampaging Absol that can Mega Evolve on its own — was similar to the NPC battles in that way, but far more hands-on. Unlike in battles against other trainers, wild pokémon can damage both your pokémon and your character, so you have to physically dodge and move around the arena while selecting your pokémon’s moves, keeping an eye on everyone’s health, and juggling cooldowns. (Using items like Potions is also on a cooldown.) Landing hits on the Rogue Mega causes it to drop orbs of “Mega Energy,” which you have to run and pick up in order to charge up a gauge to Mega Evolve your own pokémon and deal more damage.\n\nIt’s even more to balance, but I didn’t find it overwhelming, somehow. In this case, I had a Lucario at my disposal, and it had super-effective moves while also resisting Absol’s attacks, which helped. Lucario already knew Protect, too, so I got to take advantage of the strategy I had just developed in the Z-A Royale. And it’s also a familiar style of boss battle in games more generally, even if it’s different for Pokémon. It was more involved and felt more dangerous than the trainer battles, but I felt competent at it relatively quickly (especially compared to the Pidgeotto incident).\n\nMaybe it’s just a typical learning curve, and I’ll very quickly develop an updated kind of autopilot for the easier parts of Z-A. But I really did like having to think actively about Pokémon in a way that I usually save for competitive play. I hope the game can sustain that for longer than a demo, and that I’ll get to build on the Pokémon knowledge I’ve been amassing for years, rather than just passively flexing it.\n\nPokémon Legends: Z-A will be released for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16th.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"game\", \"zas\", \"system\", \"brain\", \"rewired\", \"battle\", \"legends\", \"moves\", \"cooldown\", \"pokémon\", \"za\", \"battles\", \"games\", \"type\", \"mega\"]", "content_hash": "a1ba1e5827db94157bdd8b8c8229fed44d9b9be3e45f1ae8149712712813b273", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:22.764165+00:00"}
{"url": "https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview", "title": "I talked to Sam Altman about the GPT-5 launch fiasco", "authors": "[\"Alex Heath\"]", "published": "2025-08-15T12:35:49+00:00", "text": "Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOn Thursday, I had dinner with Sam Altman, a few other OpenAI executives, and a small group of reporters in San Francisco. Altman answered our questions for hours. No topic was off limits, and everything, with the exception of what was said over dessert, was on the record.\n\nIt’s uncommon to have such an extended, wide-ranging interview with a major tech CEO over a meal. But there’s nothing common about the situation Altman finds himself in. ChatGPT has quickly become one of the most widely used, influential products on earth. Now, Altman is plotting an aggressive expansion into consumer hardware, brain-computer interfaces, and social media. He’s interested in buying Chrome if the US government forces Google to sell it. Oh, and he wants to raise trillions of dollars to build data centers.\n\nBut first, he’s focused on the response to last week’s rollout of GPT-5. About an hour before the dinner started, OpenAI pushed an update to bring back the “warmth” of 4o, its previous default model for ChatGPT. It was Altman who made the call to quickly bring back 4o as an option for paying subscribers after some protested its disappearance on Reddit and X.\n\n“I think we totally screwed up some things on the rollout,” he said. “On the other hand, our API traffic doubled in 48 hours and is growing. We’re out of GPUs. ChatGPT has been hitting a new high of users every day. A lot of users really do love the model switcher. I think we’ve learned a lesson about what it means to upgrade a product for hundreds of millions of people in one day.”\n\nHe pegged the percentage of ChatGPT users who have unhealthy relationships with the product at “way under 1 percent,” but acknowledged that OpenAI employees are having “a lot” of meetings about the topic. “There are the people who actually felt like they had a relationship with ChatGPT, and those people we’ve been aware of and thinking about. And then there are hundreds of millions of other people who don’t have a parasocial relationship with ChatGPT, but did get very used to the fact that it responded to them in a certain way, and would validate certain things, and would be supportive in certain ways.”\n\n“You will definitely see some companies go make Japanese anime sex bots because they think that they’ve identified something here that works,” he said in a not-so-subtle dig at Grok. “You will not see us do that. We will continue to work hard at making a useful app, and we will try to let users use it the way they want, but not so much that people who have really fragile mental states get exploited accidentally.”\n\nAltman wants ChatGPT to feel as personal as possible but not necessarily play to a specific ideology or political view. ”I don’t think our products should be woke. I don’t think they should be whatever the opposite of that is, either. I think our product should have a fairly center of the road, middle stance, and then you should be able to push it pretty far. If you’re like, ‘I want you to be super woke,’ it should be super woke. And if you’re like, ‘I want you to be conservative,’ it should reflect you.”\n\nChatGPT has roughly quadrupled its user base in a year and is now reaching over 700 million people each week. “Pretty soon, billions of people a day will be talking to ChatGPT,” Altman said. “We’re the fifth biggest website in the world right now. I think we’re on the clear path to the third.” (That means beating Instagram and Facebook.) “Then it gets harder. For ChatGPT to be bigger than Google, that’s really hard.”\n\nFor its operation to keep scaling, OpenAI needs a lot more GPUs. This is one of Altman’s top priorities. “You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,” he confidently told the room.\n\n“We have to make these horrible trade-offs right now,” he said. “We have better models, and we just can’t offer them because we don’t have the capacity. We have other kinds of new products and services we’d love to offer.”\n\nHe also thinks we’re in an AI bubble. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he explained. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.”\n\n“You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future”\n\nHe confirmed recent reports that OpenAI is planning to fund a brain-computer interface startup to rival Elon Musk’s Neuralink. “I think neural interfaces are cool ideas to explore. I would like to be able to think something and have ChatGPT respond to it.”\n\nDoes Fidji Simo joining OpenAI to run “applications” imply there will be other standalone apps besides ChatGPT? “Yes, you should expect that from us.” He hinted at his social media ambitions: “I am interested in whether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.” He also said, “If Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it.”\n\nWhile Altman has a lot of interests, it’s not actually clear that running OpenAI over the long run is one of them. “I’m not a naturally well-suited person to be a public company CEO,” he said at one point. “Can you imagine me on an earnings call?”\n\nI then asked if he would be CEO in a few years. “I mean, maybe an AI is in three years. That’s a long time.”\n\nHere are some other things Altman said:\n\nMaking GPT-5: “We had this big GPU crunch. We could go make another giant model. We could go make that, and a lot of people would want to use it, and we would disappoint them. And so we said, let’s make a really smart, really useful model, but also let’s try to optimize for inference cost. And I think we did a great job with that.”\n\nOpenAI’s AI device with Jony Ive: “It’s going to take us a while, but I think you will think it is very worth the wait. I think it is incredible. You don’t get a new computing paradigm very often. There have been like only two in the last 50 years. So just let yourself be happy and surprised. It really is worth the wait.”\n\nThe future of the web and publishers: “I do think people will go to fewer websites. I think people will care more about human-crafted content than ever. My directional bet would be that human-created, human-endorsed, human-curated content all goes up in value dramatically.”\n\nWhat AGI means: “Maybe the milestone that’s most relevant to us is when most of our research cluster is allocated to the AI researcher instead of the human researchers. But I don’t think that’s going to be so binary, because I think it’ll feel like people get a little more help and a little more help and a little more help.”\n\n“If we didn’t pay for training, we’d be a very profitable company.”\n\n“I don’t use Google anymore. I legitimately cannot tell you the last time I did a Google search.”\n\nPersonnel log\n\nInteresting career moves this week:\n\nThomas Dohmke Jay Parikh’s new Core AI team that absorbed it have officially overtaken GitHub’s open-source, Switzerland-for-coding ethos. I suppose I should start asking, “Are you about to quit your job?” in interviews. A week after my Decoder episode with him was published, GitHub CEO announced he was leaving for startup life. The real story here is that GitHub is less independent from the rest of Microsoft, which suggests that the commercial interests ofnew Core AI team that absorbed it have officially overtaken GitHub’s open-source, Switzerland-for-coding ethos.\n\nIgor Babuschkin , the co-founder and de facto head of Elon Musk’s xAI, , the co-founder and de facto head ofxAI, announced that he’s leaving after two years to launch an investing firm focused on AI safety. (I’m sure recent Grok headlines had nothing to do with the timing of this news.)\n\nAlexandr Wang Hyung Won Chung , Jason Wei , and Zhiqing Sun . added more OpenAI researchers to his new AI lab at Meta:, and\n\nAnthropic added Dave Orr , a Google veteran who most recently ran safety for Gemini, as its head of safety. It also hired Jordan Burgess and his team at the startup Humanloop, which has been working on LLM evaluations for businesses.\n\nJoelle Pineau, Meta’s former head of AI research, joined Cohere as chief AI officer.\n\nLink list\n\nMore to click on:\n\nAs always, I welcome your feedback.

She has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nI recently installed the biggest smart home antenna I’ve ever seen, and it helped open up new areas in my smart home, from the attic to the chicken coop. The towering 12-inch-tall Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2, which launched this week for $69, plugs into any Home Assistant system via USB and can connect to any Z-Wave device, including those using the new Long Range (LR) spec.\n\nI hooked the ZWA-2 up to my Home Assistant Yellow hub and, within minutes, it was controlling a plug all the way at the bottom of my garden. I’ve struggled with connectivity issues in my garden for years. An Eero Outdoor 7 has been a good fix for W-Fi devices such as cameras and robot lawnmowers. Now Z-Wave LR, which uses the same 900MHz band as Z-Wave to connect devices up to a mile and a half away (in ideal conditions), opens the door to using sensors, locks, and other low-powered devices in further-flung corners of my property.\n\nThe antenna itself is almost comically large. To get the best performance, it needs to be out in the open, which means it’s perched on a cupboard in my sitting room. The HA team says it is ”designed to blend into home decor. It not only resembles a candle, but it also lights up like one.” Credit to them for avoiding the “black spider” look, but it still sticks out like a glowing blue sore thumb.\n\nWhile the ZWA-2 looks fancy, its limited placement options made it hard to fit into my home decor.\n\nThat size, though, lets it pick up even the faintest Z-Wave signal and should help make your network more responsive and stable. Until now, Z-Wave antenna options in Home Assistant have been in third-party USB sticks about 3 inches long, and on other platforms, they’re generally hidden inside hubs, which can limit their range.\n\nSetting up the ZWA-2 was easy. I screwed the stick into the base and plugged it into my Yellow using a provided USB A-to-C cable. Home Assistant instantly recognized it, creating a new network. If you already have a Z-Wave network on Home Assistant, a migration tool can move your devices over in a few minutes (I saw a demo that took under 5 minutes).\n\nThe ZWA-2 plugged into a USB-A port on my Home Assistant Yellow hub. ⠀ Setting up the antenna in the Home Assistant app was straightforward. ⠀\n\nFor my first test, I used a Zooz Z-Wave LR smart plug ($35) to control two fans in my chicken coop. The coop is located at the bottom of my garden, about 50 yards (150 feet) from the antenna, through two brick walls. I scanned the plug’s QR code, selected the Z-Wave LR option (you can also choose traditional mesh; the antenna can do either), and it onboarded quickly. I then plugged it into an outlet in my garden shed near the coop and ran an extension cord to the fans. Even at that distance, the plug responded instantly to turn the fans on and off.\n\nNext, I set up a Zooz Z-Wave LR water leak sensor ($39) in my attic, where my HVAC drip pan recently overflowed, leaving a nasty stain on my ceiling. The setup was similarly straightforward. Z-Wave LR is a good solution here because sub-GHz protocols draw less power than Wi-Fi, so the coin cell battery in the sensor should last longer. (There’s no outlet near the unit for a plug-in sensor.)\n\nI tested an indoor Zooz smart plug in my garden shed. ⠀ I set it up to control the fans in my chicken coop. ⠀\n\nIf you use Z-Wave devices, which many Home Assistant users do, and have had trouble with connections or want to automate more areas of your home — a mailbox sensor, a gate sensor, leak detectors in your basement, and so on — the ZWA-2 is an easy recommendation.\n\nI’ve only been using it for a short while, so I can’t comment on reliability, but so far, the devices I’ve connected have done so smoothly in spots where I’ve struggled to find good options. And while, despite Home Assistant’s admirable efforts, the ZWA-2 really isn’t a décor piece, the range gains are worth the trade-off.\n\nPhotos by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"coop\", \"lr\", \"antenna\", \"problems\", \"stick\", \"connectivity\", \"solved\", \"zwave\", \"assistant\", \"smart\", \"devices\", \"using\", \"big\", \"garden\", \"zwa2\"]", "content_hash": "a1b63f99ae056784cbcc63cfc7051b6e324a21c4d2762ac895609adb7d7529e8", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:24.834530+00:00"}

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.\n\nFor about 15 percent of US households as of 2023, the only internet options are crappy, especially in rural areas. But thanks to the US Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program, which aims to connect everyone in the US to high-quality, mostly fiber-based internet, that’s close to changing. Or at least, it was.\n\nThe plan’s lead architect, Evan Feinman, says that before he was forced out by the Trump administration in March, three US states were just one “minor administrative step” away from connecting their first residents under BEAD. In fact, he says, they could have started the process already — if not for US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a recent Trump appointee. In March, Lutnick announced a “rigorous review” of BEAD, which he claims is too “woke” and filled with “burdensome regulations.” Now the plan may change.\n\nLutnick’s changes to BEAD could hand a lot of the program’s money over to private interests like Elon Musk’s satellite internet provider, Starlink. And for every person whose home is served by a Starlink connection, their internet will likely be slower, less reliable, and more expensive than what BEAD might have gotten them with fiber.\n\nYou can think of BEAD as a modern version of the nationwide US telephone network or electrification projects. It’s been more than three years since the Biden administration established the $42.5 billion program, and so far, it hasn’t actually connected anyone to the internet — a common criticism coming from the political right. But Feinman says that’s by design.\n\n“At every step of the game, states were screaming that we were going too fast,” he tells The Verge. “When we made allocation, more than a dozen states sent us letters saying, ‘Go slower, go slower, go slower.’” In fact, Feinman says, the first states would already have started construction if it wasn’t for delays by the Trump administration, which has been encouraging states to redo finished phases of the program to make more space for satellite internet. That shift, Feinman said in April, could effectively mean “millions of private capital is in the garbage.”\n\nUntil now, BEAD has spent its time laying the groundwork to connect people. The states were given a year and a half to come up with proposals. According to the BEAD progress dashboard, 38 states have either begun or, in the case of West Virginia, finished picking service providers for the proposals. Nevada, Delaware, and Louisiana are just waiting for final approval from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration so they can sign contracts with companies, start laying fiber, and setting up infrastructure.\n\n“More than a dozen states sent us letters saying, ‘Go slower’”\n\nIn his March statement about BEAD’s review, Lutnick accused the Biden administration of “woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies, and burdensome regulations.” The Commerce Department “is revamping the BEAD program to take a tech-neutral approach that is rigorously driven by outcomes.”\n\nHe didn’t specify what he hoped the makeup of this “tech-neutral” approach would look like. But Feinman told Financial Times in March that before he left, Lutnick had instructed BEAD’s workers to give more priority to satellite connectivity and “singled out Musk’s provider, Starlink.” Musk, of course, has been a key player in the Trump administration as well as a vocal critic of BEAD. He’s also been accused of trying to enrich himself using his unofficial, yet seemingly very powerful position within the US government.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported Lutnick planned to overhaul the program in a way that could funnel as much as $20 billion, or close to half the program’s overall funds, to Musk’s Starlink. When I asked Feinman about this number, he said it’s hard to know how much more money will go to satellite networks, but that the changes Lutnick is proposing “will shift tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of locations away from getting a fiber connection and on to the satellite networks.”\n\nAs for Lutnick’s “tech-neutral” comment, Brian Mitchell, director of Nevada broadband office OSIT, says, “I think that’s what we did from the start.” Given Nevada’s vast geography and sparse population, he says, “it was never going to be realistic for us to do 100 percent fiber like you might see elsewhere.” Nevada’s final proposal called for fiber internet in 80 percent of its locations, with satellite and fixed wireless internet making up what’s left.\n\nAs an example of what’s on the line, Feinman says West Virginia’s proposal included “a fiber connection for every single West Virginia home and business” with $150 million to spare and ahead of its deadline. That sounds pretty good for a state that says it ranks 50th out of 52 (all the states plus DC and Puerto Rico) in broadband connectivity.\n\nNow, plans like West Virginia’s could shift many of the proposed fiber connections to satellite instead. Currently, the BEAD program requires states to prioritize fiber over any other connection method for a given location, unless building it out would cost more than a certain cap — a cap each state was allowed to set. But one of Lutnick’s ideas is apparently to issue a single nationwide cap.\n\nAccording to Feinman, if Lutnick’s “one-size-fits-all cap” is low enough, satellite internet companies will always win out. In Nevada, for instance, that could see the ratio of fiber-to-satellite flipping from around 80 percent fiber to about 70 percent satellite internet, according to Feinman.\n\nNot long after Lutnick announced his BEAD review, Feinman emailed his team to say he was leaving and warned that Lutnick’s actions could mean “stranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world’s richest man even richer.” Feinman says that he had offered to continue running BEAD, but that the administration declined to renew his tenure.\n\nAlthough Lutnick hasn’t detailed specific plans for BEAD, he’s already at work changing the program. Near the end of March, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced he’d met with Lutnick and got his state a 90-day extension that Feinman says West Virginia will use to reopen service provider bidding, endangering the state’s pending fiber agreements. The Commerce Department has since issued a blanket invitation to all states to seek such extensions. That likely means at least some states will turn to slower, pricier internet for their citizens.\n\nThere are states where Starlink makes sense. Mitchell says that his state “knew that satellite was going to play a big part in connecting Nevadans, and that’s the result that we delivered.” Satellite connections make up 10 percent of the state’s final proposal. That’s a “great result for Nevadans,” he says, adding that providers are prepared to sign contracts and start building out connections “as soon as the paperwork comes in from NIST,” or the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The first Nevadans could be connected as soon as this summer, according to Mitchell. (Neither NIST nor the NTIA responded when The Verge asked about the status of those approvals.)\n\nContinued delays could be costly. Garry Gomes, CEO of Sky Fiber in Nevada, urged Lutnick earlier this month to push Nevada’s BEAD program forward in a letter to the NTIA forwarded to The Verge by OSIT. He said Sky Fiber — Nevada’s biggest awardee under BEAD — has “already invested over $360,000 in equipment, engineering, and staffing” and that its teams are ready to “immediately” start construction on BEAD deployment.\n\n“Yet the project remains stalled,” Gomes wrote. “Delays not only risk higher costs and lost labor but also erode public confidence in what is arguably the most ambitious and promising broadband investment in our nation’s history.”\n\nWould more Starlink involvement be such a bad thing? Sure, it doesn’t come close to touching fiber, but a service only has to offer over 100Mbps down and 20Mbps up, with no less than 100 milliseconds of latency, to qualify as “reliable broadband internet” under BEAD. Feinman says Starlink, while a “really really good technology,” offers service that’s “barely nosing over” that requirement. This was something that Ookla echoed in December with its median findings from Starlink users in Maine, showing that median users saw 116.77Mbps down and 18.17Mbps up. But, hey, a D minus is still a passing grade, right?\n\nBut while there’s room in BEAD for satellite internet, it’s not a replacement for hard-wired, ground-based connections. Even Musk himself has said that, having called satellite a “nice complement” to tech like fiber and 5G back in 2021.\n\nPerformance-wise, Starlink pales in comparison to fiber, which increasingly offers as much as 5 gigabits per second, down and up. That’s more than 43 times faster than Ookla’s reported median speed for Starlink. It’s 20 times faster than 249Mbps, the best-case-scenario throughput the company shows for my midwestern address. And it’s hardly worth comparing the upload speeds between the two options.\n\nStarlink service isn’t just undeniably slower than fiber; it tends to be more expensive, too. Its fixed service is $80–$120 per month and comes with pricey upfront equipment fees. (Starlink’s site advertises $30–$50 monthly, but when I tried to sign up for service while reporting this out, the price jumped to $120 a month with a $349 equipment fee, for a “total due today” of $376.57.) In some areas, Starlink’s website says its equipment is free if you sign a 12-month contract. Meanwhile, AT&T offers a gigabit fiber plan in my city of Milwaukee for $80 per month, with a $150 equipment fee.\n\n“Nobody is campaigning on slower, more expensive internet for their constituents”\n\nEven if all things were equal, Feinman says the company can’t scale to the needs of the program, as it “doesn’t have the capacity to serve that many locations.” What’s more, it’s costly to maintain Starlink’s service, which requires rocket launches into space to replace dying or outmoded satellites. Subterranean fiber, on the other hand, can last decades before needing to be replaced.\n\nBefore the Trump administration started futzing with BEAD, Feinman says the program enjoyed a great deal of bipartisan support.\n\n“This is not what anybody outside of a very small circle of Trump administration folks wanted the program to become,” he says. “This is not what Senate Republicans wanted it to become. It’s not what any member of the Democratic coalition on Capitol Hill wanted. It’s not what Republican governors wanted. It’s not what the industry wanted.”\n\nMitchell echoes that, saying that both Republicans and Democrats in his state have “been very supportive” and adding that “nobody is campaigning on slower, more expensive internet for their constituents.” He also says he doesn’t think that has changed as the administration changed hands. “All of our local officials and local governments are excited for who was awarded,” Mitchell says, “and are ready to start working with them to issue the necessary permits so they can move forward with deployment.” Instead, they’re waiting for Lutnick’s review.\n\nA bipartisan group of 115 state legislators from 28 states signed a letter to Lutnick in April, stating that while they welcome some changes to BEAD, they urge him to make them optional. “At this late stage, major changes would undermine our work and delay deployment by years,” they wrote.\n\nAs for what’s next, Feinman says he’s working hard to make noise about what’s being done with the program in an effort to preserve its core mission of connecting everyone to high-speed broadband internet. His departure letter in March said he thought the BEAD program would still mostly work even without so-called “woke” requirements, which include things like fair and safe labor practices as well as outreach to historically underrepresented and marginalized groups. He also said “shovels could already be in the ground … in half the country by summer” without Lutnick’s proposed changes and that if the administration let the program move forward, “it would be a huge political win for the Trump team.”\n\n“Instead,” Feinman says, “they’re working very hard to significantly delay a program they said was moving too slowly.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"nationwide\", \"satellite\", \"internet\", \"plan\", \"states\", \"upended\", \"lutnick\", \"fiber\", \"bead\", \"starlink\", \"feinman\", \"program\", \"administration\"]", "content_hash": "a4bd0f3dda7aa9997ab7723e6052f59e957fee48892fa82a60f0f499e6927f77", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:27.490759+00:00"}

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nEpic has won again. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will not overturn the unanimous jury verdict from 2023 that Google’s app store and payments system have become illegal monopolies — and it’s pressing play on a previously paused permanent injunction that would crack open Android to undo those monopolies. “Total victory in the Epic v Google appeal!” tweeted Epic CEO Tim Sweeney.\n\nOn Thursday, a three-judge panel affirmed the lower court’s decision in Epic v. Google, according to a full opinion you can read below — and Google will now appeal again, the company confirms to The Verge.\n\nOn Friday morning, Google revealed that because of the Ninth Circuit decision, it only has 14 days to begin changing how its Android app store and business practices work. But on Friday afternoon, the Ninth Circuit granted at least one extra week in an emergency stay, while Google works on its appeal.\n\nJudge M. Margaret McKeown begins her opinion for the Ninth Circuit panel:\n\nIn the world of adrenaline-fueled survival that epitomizes the video game Fortnite, winners are decided in blazes of destruction and glory. By contrast, the outcome of this case—centered on Fortnite’s developer, Epic Games, and the Google Android platform—turns on longstanding principles of trial procedure, antitrust, and injunctive remedies.\n\nGoogle will appeal. But the Google Play Store is not necessarily protected from the consequences of its monopoly while Google tries to do so — unless it keeps getting the courts to press pause, Google must start cracking open Android for third-party stores the way Judge James Donato ruled in his permanent injunction from 2024.\n\nLast October, Donato pressed pause on all but one specific piece of his ruling while Google appealed, but Judge McKeown writes “The stay motion on appeal is denied as moot in light of our decision” — and Epic has already announced it will put its own app store within Google’s app store.\n\n“Thanks to the verdict, the Epic Games Store for Android will be coming to the Google Play Store!” Sweeney tweeted. “The stay is lifted,” Epic spokesperson Cat McCormack confirms to The Verge.\n\nImage: Tim Sweeney (X)\n\nThe consequences of the full permanent injunction stretch far beyond Epic’s own store and its game Fortnite. They would force Google to effectively open up its app store to competition for three whole years. Google would have to distribute other rival app stores within the Google Play store, too, give rivals access to the full catalog of Google Play apps, and it would be banned from a variety of anticompetitive practices including a requirement that apps use Google Play Billing. You can read a summary of the details here.\n\n“This decision will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine the innovation that has always been central to the Android ecosystem. Our top priority remains protecting our users, developers and partners, and maintaining a secure platform as we continue our appeal,” writes Google global head of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland in a statement shared with The Verge.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Google won’t immediately have to put rival app stores within its own Google Play Store; Judge Donato originally gave Google eight months to come up with a “narrowly tailored” system to ensure Android safety and security. Once the stays end, Google will still have over seven months left, so don’t expect a store-within-store situation before 2026 at the earliest.\n\nBut unless Google keeps winning stays, other parts of the permanent injunction — like a ban on forcing app developers to use Google Play Billing — will take effect in mere weeks.\n\nEpic originally sued both Google and Apple in 2020 over the removal of its hit game Fortnite from both stores, though the case was more complicated than that. Epic intentionally used Fortnite as a wedge to challenge the app store monopolies, and in the case of Apple, it mostly lost.\n\nThe appeals court did recognize Epic’s gambit on Thursday, writing that “Google removed Fortnite from the Play Store after Epic embedded secret code into the app’s software” that bypassed Google’s payment systems. (Epic has never denied it.)\n\nBut Epic v. Google turned out to be a very different case, we saw when attending the trial in person and reading all the receipts. A jury saw secret revenue sharing deals between Google, smartphone makers, and game developers. The jury saw internal emails between Google execs that suggested Google was scared of how Epic might convince its fellow game developers to join or create rival app stores, creating unwanted competition for Google. Here are a few thoughts about why Epic won against Google, but not Apple.\n\nOn Thursday, the Ninth Circuit rejected the idea that the decision in the Apple case should impact the Google case, at least in terms of the all-important question of market definition, aka “can Google really have a monopoly on Android apps if it’s competing against Apple?”\n\n“The market definition question was neither identical to the issue in this case nor litigated and decided in Apple,” McKeown writes, adding that the “commercial realities are different”:\n\nApple’s “walled garden” is, as the district court in Apple noted, markedly different from Google’s “open distribution” approach […] Google admits as much, noting that “Android’s open philosophy offers users and developers wider choices” than iOS does, even as that openness “limit[s] Google’s ability to directly protect users from encountering malware and security threats when they download apps.” As a consequence of its business model, Apple does not license iOS to other OEMs in the way that Google licenses Android to Samsung, Motorola, and other smartphone manufacturers.\n\nShe also uses McDonalds and Chick-fil-A to make a point that markets can overlap:\n\nMcDonald’s might compete against Chick-fil-A in the fast- food market yet not compete against Chick-fil-A in the hamburger fast-food market (and instead compete with Wendy’s, Burger King, Sonic, and In-N-Out Burger. Although Google and Apple compete for mobile-gaming downloads and mobile-gaming in-app transactions, they do not compete in the Android-only app distribution and in-app billing markets.\n\nThose two markets, Android app distribution and in-app billing, are where a jury unanimously decided that Google has illegal monopolies.\n\nUpdate, August 1st: Added details of Google’s new emergency stay request, and details of how it was granted.\n\nCorrection, July 31st: An earlier version of this article stated that Google confirmed it would appeal to the Supreme Court, but it did not actually specify which court.

He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nIn April, Intel attempted to announce layoffs without announcing layoffs. “We have not set any headcount reduction target,” Intel spokesperson Sophie Metzger told The Verge. But the company has laid off thousands of employees since — and today, in the company’s Q2 2025 earnings, it has revealed that Intel will dramatically shrink as a result of those layoffs. Intel says it will retreat from planned projects in Germany and Poland, end its assembly and test operations in Costa Rica, and finish 2025 with just around 75,000 “core employees” in total.\n\nIntel employed 109,800 people at the end of 2024, of which 99,500 were “core employees,” so the company is pushing out around 24,000 people this year — shrinking Intel by roughly one-quarter. (It has also divested other businesses, shrinking the larger organization as well.)\n\nToday, on the company’s earnings call, Intel’s CEO says that Intel had overinvested in new factories before it had secured enough demand, that its factories had become “needlessly fragmented,” and that it needs to grow its capacity “in lock step” with achieving actual milestones.\n\n“I do not subscribe to the belief that if you build it, they will come. Under my leadership, we will build what customers need when they need it, and earn their trust,” says Tan.\n\nNow, in Germany and Poland, where Intel was planning to spend tens of billions of dollars respectively on “mega-fabs” that would employ 3,000 workers, and on an assembly and test facility that would employ 2,000 workers, the company will “no longer move forward with planned projects” and is apparently axing them entirely.\n\nIntel has had a presence in Poland since 1993, however, and the company did not say its R&D facilities there are closing. (Intel had previously pressed pause on the new Germany and Poland projects “by approximately two years” back in 2024.)\n\nIn Costa Rica, where Intel employs over 3,400 people, the company will “consolidate its assembly and test operations in Costa Rica into its larger sites in Vietnam.” Metzger tells The Verge that over 2,000 Costa Rica employees should remain to work in engineering and corporate, though.\n\nThe company is also cutting back in Ohio: “Intel will further slow the pace of construction in Ohio to ensure spending is aligned with market demand.” Intel CFO David Zinsner says Intel will continue to make investments there, though, and construction will continue.\n\nIt’s not clear if the layoffs will slow now that we’re over halfway through the year, but Intel states today that it has already “completed the majority of the planned headcount actions it announced last quarter to reduce its core workforce by approximately 15 percent.”\n\nSo far, partially because of the $1.9 billion that Intel is incurring to do these layoffs and this restructuring, Intel is still losing money this quarter. It’s reporting a $2.9 billion loss on $12.9 billion in quarterly revenue (which is itself flat year over year). Amid the ongoing AI boom, Intel’s data center business is only up 4 percent year over year to $3.9 billion, while its PC chips are down 3 percent to $7.9 billion. Intel’s foundry business, where it does chipmaking for other customers as well, is up 3 percent to $4.4 billion.\n\nThe company says it’s on track to shrink its expenses by $17 billion over the full year, and that at least one of its next flagship laptop chips is on track, too: “The first Panther Lake processor SKU remains on track to begin shipping later this year, with additional SKUs coming in the first half of 2026.”\n\nIntel’s follow-up, Nova Lake, is still on track for the end of 2026, according to Tan, and he says he has “taken steps to correct past mistakes regarding multi-threading capabilities” in the company’s Performance cores there. What’s more, Tan says he’s personally taking on responsibility for each new chip design with a new policy that he says is already in effect: “every major chip design needs to be personally reviewed and approved by me before tape out.”\n\nMeanwhile, Intel says it’s also ramping its popular but previously expensive Lunar Lake chips this next quarter.\n\nTan says he will also announce new leadership for Intel’s data center business next quarter, and will share more on its strategy for a full-stack AI solution “in the coming months.”\n\nCorrection, July 24th: We originally incorrectly calculated that Intel would shed around 33,000 employees, but the actual total should be closer to 24,000. (Intel stated it would end the year with 75,000 core employees, but the 108,900 number we originally compared to was last year’s total headcount including other related businesses, not Intel core headcount, which was 99,500.)", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"track\", \"poland\", \"intels\", \"layoffs\", \"24000\", \"intel\", \"rica\", \"employees\", \"billion\", \"core\", \"countries\", \"laying\", \"company\", \"retreating\"]", "content_hash": "01dc433776663305c44f59d263f6f33a4a330dc71be4a29abd770d899061f5f5", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:33.458309+00:00"}

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe Supreme Court will let Mississippi’s social media age verification law take effect while the case is being argued in court. In an unsigned ruling on Thursday, the court declined to block the law after an emergency petition from trade association NetChoice. The order offers no explanation, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the law was “likely unconstitutional” — but that NetChoice hadn’t “sufficiently demonstrated” a risk of harm.\n\nThe law, HB 1126, requires social media platforms to verify the age of the person creating the account, while blocking users under 18 unless they have permission from a parent. It also states that social media sites must protect underage users from “harmful material” — such as sexual content and material related to self-harm — as well as restrict data collection.\n\nNetChoice, which is backed by tech giants like Meta, Google, Amazon, Reddit, and Discord, argues that age verification laws for general-purpose social media violate the First Amendment. Though the trade association won an injunction to block the law last year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated it in April, allowing the law to go into effect. As Justice Kavanaugh noted, however, numerous district courts have blocked similar laws in other states.\n\n“To be clear, NetChoice has, in my view, demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits — namely, that enforcement of the Mississippi law would likely violate its members’ First Amendment rights.”\n\nDespite this setback, NetChoice is still confident that it will prevail. “Although we’re disappointed with the Court’s decision, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment — not just in this case but across all NetChoice’s ID-for-Speech lawsuits,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement. “This is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.”\n\nThe decision comes as lawmakers across the US — and around the world — push age verification mandates designed to protect children from harmful content on the internet. In June, the Supreme Court upheld a Texas law that requires users to verify their ages before accessing porn sites, paving the way for similar laws to take effect — but specifically for platforms focused on adult content. Meanwhile, the UK has begun to enforce a broader online age-gating requirement that asks users to verify their age with a government ID, a face scan, or by entering credit card information on certain websites.\n\nJennifer Huddleston, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that age verification laws have “significant impacts on privacy and speech rights of both adult and teen users.” Huddleston notes that today’s decision doesn’t mean the court “will automatically uphold this law as constitutional should it reach it through the full appeals process.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"opens\", \"agegating\", \"court\", \"age\", \"verification\", \"users\", \"door\", \"verify\", \"supreme\", \"law\", \"laws\", \"media\", \"social\", \"netchoice\"]", "content_hash": "ddb783da6dfdd08593cb8cd78be2944c099b046e08c9ef12cab288fb13b50aef", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:34.447448+00:00"}

The gamepads on the market now are of higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from even one console generation ago. If you play games on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you have the unenviable task of choosing between several high-quality controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, Nacon, and Turtle Beach. Some of them have drift-resistant Hall effect or TMR-based joysticks for improved longevity, yet all of them are good for one reason or another. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool, but barely worked, are over.\n\nWe’ve spent a ton of time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard, Xbox Wireless Controller is the best option for most folks. It makes for a great PC and Steam Deck controller, too. The default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, but there are several alternatives worth considering.\n\nFeatured in this article\n\nWhat we’re looking for How we test Xbox controllers Collapse We test Xbox controllers by playing with them for an extended period of time across a variety of genres. Our test targets include team-based arena games like Marvel Rivals, competitive shooters like Call of Duty, fighters like Tekken 8, and role-playing titles like Elden Ring. When doing so, we pay close attention to how all of the components feel. Are the triggers satisfying to pull? Do the analog sticks offer the right level of resistance? Are the D-pads and face buttons too mushy, or just right? If a controller includes customization options — such as adjustable trigger stops and sensitivity, and / or remappable back buttons — we test how easy they are to configure, then judge their impact on our gameplay experience. Connectivity Collapse Is it wireless? Does it support Bluetooth? Or is it wired only? If so, is the cable replaceable? Quality Collapse Does it feel cheap or nicely made? Any glitches or reliability issues while testing? Extra features Collapse Does it have handy extras, like remappable buttons or fancy triggers? Customization Collapse Can you remap buttons or tune it with custom software profiles? Value Collapse Is it priced affordably, about average, or does it come at a steep premium?\n\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\n\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable\n\nOkay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of all that has made the last 20 years of Xbox gamepads great, and it shows.\n\nThanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, this is the only affordable wireless Xbox controller out there. (Third-party wireless options have been trickling out in recent years, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox wireless controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C wired connection.\n\nYou won’t find a better wireless controller at this price. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nBut the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its varied connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $65 (and often less) asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you’ll probably be best served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like Hori’s Horipad Pro — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is otherwise an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.\n\nThe only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity (button remapping is available), though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which bumps the price from $79.99 to $116.95 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors that Microsoft offers.\n\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\n\nConnectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Wired\n\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $44.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99. The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.\n\nOn the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks with satisfying tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the PowerA Advantage Wired. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we’d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers. You can download the 8BitDo Ultimate Software X app on PC or Xbox to fully customize this controller.\n\n8BitDo controllers may be inexpensive, but that doesn’t mean they should be considered cheap. Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge\n\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a three-mode wireless version for $69.99 with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles.\n\nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\n\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\n\nThe Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fanciest controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and as a result, it just feels nicer in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $199.99 (or sometimes less, if it’s on sale).\n\nThere’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $149.99, which ditches the add-ons but is equally customizable. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.\n\nA pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of a splurge purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels that require its high-end features. Nevertheless, it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your liking, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc., while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool or easy as when using an Elite.\n\nWhile the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).\n\nThe Elite Series 2 offers unprecedented customization with analog sticks and a D-pad you can pluck right off. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nEven so, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.\n\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\n\nConnectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\n\nAt $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is as expensive (or more, depending on available deals) than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, yielding a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours).\n\nOther than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.\n\nIt’s not every day you see six buttons on top of a controller. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\n\nThe Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its more basic software customization, its lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its high price, which, unlike the Series 2, is rarely subjected to discounts. Luckily, if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired configuration.\n\nOther Xbox controllers we tested\n\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nWe’re testing GameSir’s G7 Pro, a $79.99 controller that’s compatible with Xbox (wired), PC (wired and wireless via an included 2.4GHz dongle), and Android (wireless via Bluetooth). The G7 Pro has drift-resistant TMR joysticks, Hall effect analog triggers, four customizable buttons, four rumble motors, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The controller comes with a charging dock, a three meter-long USB-C to USB-A cable, and two swappable D-pads.\n\nHyperkin Competitor was at announced at CES in January and is scheduled to arrive later in 2025. The wired gamepad’s design is unashamedly inspired by the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controllers, complete with glassy buttons and a non-contiguous D-pad. was at announced at CES in January and is scheduled to arrive later in 2025The wired gamepad’s design is unashamedly inspired by the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controllers, complete with glassy buttons and a non-contiguous D-pad.\n\nUpdate, August 14th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability, and to note we’ll be testing GameSir’s G7 Pro.

Now, a new type of SSD out of China could be the best of both worlds — and it’s already set to appear in two cutting-edge gaming portables.\n\nChinese storage manufacturer Biwin is calling it the “Mini SSD,” though another manufacturer refers to it as the “1517”; it measures just 15mm x 17mm x 1.4mm thick, smaller than a U.S. penny and just slightly larger than MicroSD. Despite that, it offers maximum sequential read speeds of 3,700 megabytes per second (or 3,400MB/s writes) over a PCIe 4x2 connection, and offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities.\n\nImage via GPD Image via GPD\n\nTo put that in context, the new MicroSD Express cards that work with the Nintendo Switch 2 top out at a theoretical 985MB/s, less than a third the speed. And while a full-size SD Express card could theoretically beat Mini SSD at 3,940MB/s, it would be nearly twice the size of Biwin’s creation.\n\nThe nano-SIMs used in recent smartphones are still smaller, though, and M.2 drives are still faster. I whipped up a quick chart so you can easily compare various storage cards and SIMs:\n\nType Length Width Height Theoretical max speed Mini SSD 15mm 17mm 1.4mm 3,700MB/s MicroSD 11mm 15mm 1mm 985MB/s SD 24mm 32mm ~2mm (varies) 3,940MB/s M.2 2230 22mm 30mm ~2mm (varies) ~8,000MB/s M.2 2280 22mm 80mm ~2mm (varies) ~14,000MB/s Nano-SIM 8.8mm 12.3mm 0.67mm N/A Micro-SIM 12mm 15mm 0.76mm N/A Mini-SIM 15mm 25mm 0.76mm N/A\n\nIt’s not clear if Biwin’s Mini SSD is a true standard that other storage makers can easily adopt. But the company’s marketing it for laptops, tablets, phones, cameras and more, with its own dedicated slot that works exactly like smartphone SIM card slots: stick in a pin to remove the tray.\n\nImage: Biwin\n\nThe company claims IP68 water and dust resistance, which could be handy for phones in particular, and three-meter drop resistance.\n\nTwo cutting-edge Chinese gaming portables already appear to be customers, both of which made announcements at ChinaJoy this past week. There’s the GPD Win 5, the monster battery backpack wielding Strix Halo handheld we told you about in July, which you can see with the new SSD in the video atop this story.\n\nOneNetbook’s upcoming OneXPlayer Super X hybrid laptop/tablet, which has the same Strix Halo chip, is also now advertising a dedicated “card slot” for a mini SSD.\n\nWe don’t have any idea of pricing on these new SSDs, and have seen no product listings for them yet.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"15mm\", \"ssd\", \"varies\", \"small\", \"ssds\", \"launch\", \"sim\", \"x\", \"mini\", \"card\", \"storage\", \"m2\", \"microsd\", \"china\", \"cards\", \"insert\"]", "content_hash": "70a53b045782d08c418dccbde933cc6437808e49621f1b5affa67db9db1b5d14", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:36.592511+00:00"}

In an update on Thursday, the platform says it will let users verify their age by scanning their face, uploading an ID, or entering a payment card.\n\nBluesky will perform age verification through Kid Web Services (KWS), an Epic Games-owned tool that developers can use to implement age verification and parental controls on their platforms.

On Thursday, Google announced that it’s testing a new AI-powered Flight Deals tool, which could come in handy if you’re planning a trip on a budget but aren’t quite sure where you want to go yet.\n\nInstead of just entering your preferred airport and destination, Flight Deals takes a more open-ended approach. You can describe the kind of place you’d like to visit, and even get specific about how long you want to sit on a plane and what activities you’d like to do once you get there. Google will then use AI to come up with cheap flights that match your preferences. For example, you can search for “a weekend countryside getaway with trail rides and kayaking” or a “trip to Europe with great cheese and wine in May,” and see what pops up.\n\nThese three cities fit the bill of a “countryside getaway with trail rides and kayaking.” Screenshot: The Verge\n\nWhile using Flight Deals, I found that it surfaced a mix of obvious vacation spots and some lesser-known locations. When looking for “a tropical destination with snorkeling,” it showed me spots like Cozumel, Mexico; Nassau, Bahamas; and San Juan, Puerto Rico, which were predictable but viable suggestions. But a search for a “trip to Europe with hiking” showed suggestions for a couple of cities that I wouldn’t have thought of — Cluj-Napoca, Romania and Ljubljana, Slovenia — which is nice if you’re looking for something off the beaten path.\n\nStill, some of the results I got weren’t useful at all. When searching for “a tropical weekend trip that’s less than 5 hours away” from the Orlando airport, it yielded results for Miami and Key West, which may not be ideal for someone looking to travel outside the state. I also managed to stump it by searching for “trips to Japan during cherry blossom season” — it said it found “no deals” for this search.\n\nAsking for a “trip to Europe with mountains to hike” yielded some interesting results. Screenshot: The Verge\n\nIf you don’t specify when you’d like to visit, Google will default to showing you flights within the next six months. You can also play around with some of the filters, like how many stops you want, or which airline you’d prefer — but the nice thing about this AI-powered revamp is that you don’t have to.\n\nDespite some hiccups, I could still see myself trying out Flight Deals if I’m looking for travel ideas that aren’t super out of my budget. I probably wouldn’t entrust AI with planning out my entire trip, but having it generate some destination ideas, which I can then do more research on, doesn’t hurt. Google Flight Deals is rolling out in beta to users in the US and Canada over the next week.

This new flexible working arrangement then became an official “hybrid workplace” policy several months after the pandemic began, allowing managers to approve permanent remote work. Now that the pandemic has settled into endemicity, Microsoft wants employees to return to the office. And if some quit in response, well, that’s probably exactly what Microsoft is expecting.\n\nMuch like Amazon or Google before it, Microsoft is preparing a mandatory return-to-office policy, according to sources familiar with the company’s plans. Rumors of the return-to-office policy first emerged a few weeks ago internally at Microsoft, leading to plenty of speculation among employees. A recent Experiences + Devices all-hands call revealed that Microsoft’s senior leadership team is working on “some guidance” that will be announced to employees in the coming weeks.\n\nI understand that Microsoft is preparing to announce a mandatory return to office of three days a week. The policy will apply to those who live within 50 miles of Microsoft’s Redmond campus, and some teams at Microsoft may even return for four or five days. Those individual team decisions will be made by executive vice presidents, and I understand that employees will also be able to apply for exceptions.\n\nMore than half of Microsoft’s 228,000 employees are in the US, and most of that 125,000 are located near the company’s Redmond campus just outside of Seattle, so this policy will affect a lot of Microsoft employees. Business Insider first reported the rumors of a return-to-office policy last week, and I understand it will be announced in September and then implemented in late January.\n\nOn that same Experiences + Devices all-hands call, Microsoft said that employees who spend three or four days in the office have higher Thriving Scores — a metric that measures employee well-being. Microsoft has been increasingly integrating the Thrive Global tool into Microsoft Teams, and using it to gauge how employees are feeling through questionnaires.\n\nScott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft’s cloud and AI group, told employees last year that the company wasn’t changing its return-to-office policy unless productivity dropped. Microsoft has continued to post impressive earnings results over the past five years, even driving the company to a $4 trillion market cap recently — so productivity clearly hasn’t been a huge issue.\n\nI’ve spoken to dozens of Microsoft employees in recent weeks about the upcoming return-to-office policy, and there’s a real split of opinion on it. Some employees are concerned about a mandatory return, especially given the local road traffic problems and the amount of time lost in travel.\n\nOthers are worried about Microsoft not having enough space for everyone to return at the same time, despite the company’s $5 billion headquarters expansion. Microsoft has vacated lots of spaces in Bellevue in recent years, including the 27-story City Center building, the two Bravern office towers, and the Advanta campus. It has also given up space in Redmond, in efforts to cut the costs associated with office space that isn’t being used as regularly anymore.\n\nMicrosoft’s campus renovation includes 17 new buildings to replace 12 old buildings and hold 8,000 additional employees. Seven buildings are now open, with others under construction or on hold. It’s still not clear when Microsoft will complete its sprawling campus overhaul, as the company hasn’t put a firm end date on construction.\n\nThis potential lack of space is already being felt by some employees who are using the office space regularly. Some teams have desks assigned to individuals, and others are hot-desking. One source tells me there often aren’t enough focus rooms for online meetings and some rooms aren’t large enough for bigger meetings. In some buildings, Microsoft has been squeezing in so many employees that they’ve run out of power, I’m told. Despite this, I understand Microsoft is aiming to provide dedicated desks to support employees returning for three days a week.\n\nOther Redmond employees welcome the return-to-office policy, having spent the past few years working in vacant offices with empty cafeterias or half-empty connector buses around campus. I visit Microsoft’s campus regularly every year for product briefings and launch events, and it’s been eerily quiet recently — particularly with the empty, unfinished buildings.\n\nIt’s clear to me from talking to Microsoft employees that most will agree that this could be seen as a type of stealth layoff, months after around 15,000 roles were cut. Morale is already at an all-time low inside Microsoft, and if you’re not happy about returning to the office three days a week and you can’t get an exception, then that makes it difficult to continue at the company. It also seems like an easy way for Microsoft’s management teams to weed out “rest and vest” employees that are coasting along.\n\nMicrosoft’s return-to-office policy could also shape remote or hybrid working for other companies. Microsoft made a big deal about its hybrid workplace when it started reopening its headquarters, and it also marketed Microsoft Teams on the basis of being a tool that could help with the tension of meetings that include remote and in-person attendees. Before AI became Microsoft’s new focus, it even held a special “Windows Powers the Future of Hybrid Work” event.\n\nA lot of companies followed Microsoft’s lead on remote work, and they may now be looking at its mandatory three-day return and thinking it’s a tacit admission that Teams doesn’t always work for everyone — especially if you’re a junior employee and you need to get face-to-face time with colleagues. Microsoft isn’t going quite as far as Amazon’s full return, or Google’s policy to force some remote workers to come back three days a week or lose their jobs, but it may well help revise a standard that many companies are already following.\n\nThe pad:\n\nI’m heading to Germany next week for Gamescom, so if you’re at the show please say hello. I’m looking forward to getting my hands on the new Xbox Ally handheld devices, and I’ll have plenty of impressions to share soon.\n\nI’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at [email protected] if you want to discuss anything else.

She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.\n\nElon Musk is calling in another return on his investment in American politics: he’s threatening Apple with a lawsuit because neither X nor xAI’s Grok have been recommended on the iOS App Store. How serious this threat is — well, that’s hard to say, as it was posted between Grok-generated waifus.\n\n“Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?,” he whined, in a post which was briefly pinned to his profile.\n\nMusk, the CEO of xAI and one of God’s sorest winners, isn’t content with how well his apps are doing in the store. He wants an Apple endorsement, too. If you are unfamiliar with the App Store, first of all, congratulations. But second, there are portions of it that are editorially curated, with the store recommending certain apps as “essentials,” as well as “editors’ choice.” Musk’s apps still appear on the charts — they just aren’t getting boosted by Apple itself on the front page of the iOS App Store.\n\nThis is pretty brazen gangster behavior\n\nApple is, in some sense, splash damage in Musk’s ongoing beef with OpenAI. “Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk said in another post.\n\nIt’s also not the first time Musk has used “antitrust” as an excuse to tie a perceived nemesis up in the court system. As part of the aforementioned OpenAI beef, Musk has claimed that OpenAI and Microsoft have attempted to “monopolize the generative AI market” by using exclusivity agreements with investors when raising capital, refusing to let xAI license OpenAI’s tech because of the Microsoft exclusivity agreement, and “lock[ing] down” AI talent.\n\nThis is pretty brazen gangster behavior — gangster tech regulation, to be more precise. Sure, Musk and Trump aren’t as close as they once were, but Musk didn’t pay all that money to get Trump elected for nothing. If Musk does file suit, and does so in a friendly court — perhaps that of Tesla shareholder Reed O’Connor, the judge in the Northern District of Texas — the legal pressure could lead to some concessions. It does seem that barely disguised extortion has been fashionable lately among the right wing.\n\nMusk’s apps seem to fly in the face of App Store guidelines\n\nIn response to Musk’s provocation, Apple said that the App Store is “designed to be fair and free of bias … we feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria,” an Apple spokesperson, who wasn’t named, told Bloomberg.\n\nThat is obvious horseshit, but not in the way Musk claims.\n\nLet’s just visit Musk’s apps, which I suspect are currently in violation of Apple’s rules. Take Grok, for instance. Apple recently removed three apps that made deepfake nudes, presumably because they created nonconsensual images. Grok, put in “spicy” mode, will create topless Taylor Swift images, even if it is not directly prompted to do so. (Google’s Veo and OpenAI’s Sora have some protections in place to prevent this kind of thing; how good they are is a separate matter.)\n\nBoth apps seem to fly in the face of the App Store guidelines, which say that “apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy.” Examples include “overtly sexual or pornographic material;” “realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused;” and “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted individual or group.”\n\nDespite all these flagrant violations of App Store policies, Apple has not removed Grok or X\n\nAny social media site that relies on user-generated content is going to have some problems adhering to these guidelines, which is why many of them have — or, I suppose I should say, had — robust moderation. And Twitter was arguably in violation of App Store guidelines before Musk bought it, as Tumblr CEO Matt Mullenweg noted. (Tumblr, of course, has had its own moderation woes in attempting to comply with Apple’s practices.)\n\nWhen Musk bought Twitter, moderation went out the window. That also created a misinformation problem, which is especially pronounced when it comes to Israel’s war in Gaza, and arguably violates another of Apple’s rules banning “harmful concepts which capitalize or seek to profit on recent or current events, such as violent conflicts.”\n\nGrok doesn’t even have the excuse of moderation or user-generated content; it’s making the violating content all by itself.\n\nDespite all these flagrant violations of App Store policies, Apple has not removed Grok or X from the store. Indeed, it resumed advertising on X in February, after pulling ads for a year in response to Musk’s posts.\n\nOnce you show you’re willing to pay a bribe, the asks don’t quit\n\nSo while Musk has a point that Apple unfairly preferences some apps, it is his own apps that benefit. And Apple is really only in a tough spot because it’s Musk throwing a tantrum. After all, it’s not clear that there’s a direct antitrust argument here. Antitrust laws generally target the market power of a firm — ones that suppress competition. So in practice, if Apple is preferencing its own apps in the App Store editorial sections, that may be an antitrust violation. Anticompetitive agreements — like Google buying preference in Safari’s search to prevent Apple from making its own search engine — would also be fair game. There’s no evidence any such agreement exists with OpenAI, although the two companies do have a partnership. Indeed, given Grok’s proclivity for celebrity nudes, it seems likelier that Apple is promoting the AI app that doesn’t make a bunch of naked Taylors Swift.\n\nBut if there’s one thing Musk loves doing, it’s tying people up in endless litigation. It’s unlikely that a noisome Musk suit, like the one he filed against Media Matters, will threaten Apple as a going concern. It can, however, lead to embarrassing in-court admissions, serve as a headache and distraction, and otherwise generally be a nuisance. And if Musk still has any sway in the Justice Department, his enmity might make the DOJ more aggressive in pursuing its unrelated antitrust case. In comparison, giving Grok a little visibility boost in the App Store might not seem so bad… except that it tells Musk what will get Apple to crack.\n\nPerhaps this will serve as a lesson to Apple and the rest of us: once you show you’re willing to pay a bribe, the asks don’t quit. It may have been smarter for Apple to continue to refuse to advertise on X. Too late now — Musk wants more, and he thinks Apple will give it. If that’s not our new era of gangster tech, I don’t know what is.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"comes\", \"openai\", \"apple\", \"tech\", \"store\", \"antitrust\", \"x\", \"regulation\", \"app\", \"grok\", \"content\", \"elon\", \"musk\", \"apps\", \"musks\", \"gangster\"]", "content_hash": "d7b1fd2cb8265fd6c78a4c93be3d8df0068538b3c6c8c1c14527eb408fa03574", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:53.159840+00:00"}

Despite its size, we found the Palma 2 could last between four or five days per charge.\n\nThe Palma 2 has 128GB of storage, which is sufficient for holding hundreds of ebooks, but you could eat it up quickly by loading the device with apps from Google’s Play Store. If you run out of space, you can pop in a microSD card to add more. Its USB-C charging port doubles as a headphone jack, so you can download music, podcasts, and audiobooks for offline listening, all of which take up a lot more space than a typical ebook. You can also play audio through the Palma 2’s built-in speaker. The device even has a 16-megapixel camera, though in our tests it was best used for scanning documents and QR codes rather than taking photos.\n\nIf you want an e-reader that’s convenient to grab before you head out the door each morning, Boox’s Palma 2 is the only one that may reasonably fit in your pocket. Its size and shape can also make reading one-handed in a crowded train or while eating lunch more comfortable than a Kindle. It’s also more capable thanks to its ability to access Google Play Store, though the limits of an E Ink display may curb your desire to download social media apps or other distractions that can keep you from finally finishing War & Peace.\n\nVerge Deals Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

{"url": "https://www.theverge.com/news/759240/philips-hue-leak-hue-bridge-pro-zigbee-motion-sensing", "title": "Philips Hue’s new bridge could turn your lights into motion sensors", "authors": "[\"Jennifer Pattison Tuohy\"]", "published": "2025-08-14T14:30:06+00:00", "text": "is a senior reviewer focused on smart home and connected tech, with over twenty years of experience. She has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nSmart lighting company Philips Hue appears to be launching a new version of its bridge, the first in a decade. According to a product page briefly published on Hue’s website and since removed, the Hue Bridge Pro will be faster, have more capacity, and can “turn your smart lights into motion sensors.” A Hue video doorbell, new outdoor lighting, and a more energy-efficient A19 light bulb are also on the way.\n\nThe page, which was first spotted by HueBlog, outlined all the new products but revealed no specs or prices. Signify, Hue’s parent company, is hosting a press event in Berlin next month, ahead of the IFA tech trade show, where we expect full details.\n\nThe standout news is the bridge’s new motion-sensing capability. Details are scarce, but the description mentions “built-in MotionAware technology.” Wi-Fi motion sensing technology has been around for years — Hue’s sister company Wiz uses it in its Wi-Fi bulbs — but Hue lights work over Zigbee, not Wi-Fi. In January, a company called Ivani debuted its Sensify wireless sensing technology, which can turn mains-powered Zigbee devices (like light bulbs) into motion sensors with a firmware update.\n\nA leaked image of the new bridge breaks down its tech specs, which include more RAM, a faster processor, and the addition of Wi-Fi. Image: Signify\n\nAt the time, Ivani co-founder Justin McKinney told The Verge the company was working with “large household names poised to deploy the technology very soon.” It’s possible one of those companies is Hue, and that Sensify’s tech is powering the upgrade that could let your existing Hue bulbs and accessories act as motion sensors. This would make them capable of automatically adjusting your lights as you move through the house without the need for standalone motion sensors.\n\nThe bridge will also have “advanced AI features,” likely tied to Hue’s new AI lighting assistant. According to additional reporting by HueBlog, the Bridge Pro will feature a faster processor, more RAM, the addition of Wi-Fi connectivity so you don’t have to plug it into your router, and support for up to 150 bulbs and 50 accessories — more than triple the current bridge’s capability.\n\nThe first official picture of the new Hue Wired Doorbell shows a slim device with a prominent button surrounded by LEDs and the Hue logo beneath a camera. Image: Signify\n\nIn addition to the bridge, Hue is preparing a new wired video doorbell, first leaked in March. A new image shows a design reminiscent of the second-gen August doorbell. The Hue website noted it will stream in 2K, an upgrade from the 1080p on Hue’s 2023 security cameras.\n\nAnother confirmed rumor: Hue lights will soon be controlled by Sonos’ voice assistant. According to the page, you’ll be able to tell Sonos speakers to turn Hue lights on and off, dim or brighten, change their colors, or select a light scene. While Sonos Voice Control is more limited than Alexa or Siri, all commands are processed locally.\n\nThe new flagship Hue A19 bulb features better energy efficiency and deeper dimming alongside improved color synching. Image: Signify\n\nOf course, there are new lights coming, too. The page reveals a new, more energy-efficient E26/A19 60-watt smart bulb that uses 40 percent less energy and dims as low as 0.2. percent. It supports Hue’s ChromaSync tech for more precise color matching when syncing across fixtures — a feature also coming to a new “family of indoor and outdoor light strips” with gradient lighting.\n\nTwo new Festavia-branded outdoor lights are on the way: a set of permanent outdoor lights designed to be fixed to the outside of your house, similar to those offered by Govee and Nanoleaf, and a set of Globe String lights. The globe lights look particularly attractive, with each bulb featuring a “distinctive inner tube” that can be customized with light gradients, colors, and special effects.\n\nThe Festavia Globe String Lights are soooo pretty. Image: Signify\n\nIt’s an impressive lineup, but the upgraded bridge with motion-sensing technology is the standout. Not only should it strengthen Hue’s lighting system and support more devices, it could eliminate the need for dedicated motion sensors altogether. I’ll be in Berlin next month for IFA to see the official launch and get hands-on with these new products.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"hues\", \"philips\", \"image\", \"tech\", \"lights\", \"bridge\", \"technology\", \"motion\", \"light\", \"turn\", \"hue\", \"sensors\", \"wifi\"]", "content_hash": "85b438594e08f96822974c29ab5a0307b3e1082779efd08daaa878139f0081f4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:55.265128+00:00"}

{"url": "https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/719409/nuclear-energy-uranium-enrichment-ai-data-center-electricity", "title": "AI could turn your town nuclear", "authors": "[\"Justine Calma\"]", "published": "2025-08-06T13:30:00+00:00", "text": "These days, Paducah, Kentucky — population 27,000 and home to the National Quilt Museum — prides itself as “Quilt City.” But decades ago, it was also called the “Atomic City” — a moniker it could soon regain as AI’s energy needs bring Paducah’s nuclear past back to life.\n\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) operated a uranium enrichment plant in Paducah for more than 60 years until the plant shuttered in 2013 amid a downturn in nuclear energy. The same year, Paducah was designated a UNESCO “creative city” for its quilts, a title it now boasts on its website (along with a city-led initiative to make Paducah more “considerate and kind”).\n\nToday, the enrichment facility is in the spotlight again after a Peter Thiel-backed startup announced plans to revive the shuttered plant. In July, Donald Trump’s administration also chose Paducah as one of four sites where it says it’ll partner with private companies to develop AI data centers and energy projects.\n\nBig Tech — thirsty for enough electricity to power its AI ambitions — wants to make nuclear energy cool again. It’s all playing into the Trump administration’s plans to remake the US power grid without solar and wind power. If they manage to revitalize nuclear energy in America, the US is going to need more enriched uranium. And that supply chain could bring big changes to even small cities like Paducah.\n\nBig Tech — thirsty for enough electricity to power its AI ambitions — wants to make nuclear energy cool again\n\nAt an August 5th event in Paducah, General Matter shared details about its vision for the facility. It says it’ll develop what it considers the “the nation’s first U.S.-owned, privately developed uranium enrichment facility” on the site and that it has signed “a multi-decade, one hundred-acre lease” with the DOE. General Matter plans to start enriching uranium in Paducah by the end of the decade and “produce the fuel needed for the next generation of nuclear energy, central to America’s aspirations in AI, manufacturing, and other critical industries,” according to a statement on X. (A DOE press release says enrichment operations aren’t planned until 2034, however, and that construction is slated to start in 2026.)\n\nThat doesn’t quite answer some key questions about the company’s plans. (General Matter didn’t respond to several emails from The Verge.) Will the company rely on the same outdated technology the shuttered plant has always used or build something new? If it does plan to revamp the facility with modern technology, does it plan to produce the same kind of low-enriched uranium that America’s existing nuclear reactors run on, or does it think it can be one of the first plants to produce more highly enriched uranium (called HALEU) for advanced reactors? The answers to those questions will define how ambitious of a project this really is, and the impact it could have on power grids across the US. The recent DOE press release notes that General Matter is one of four companies the agency selected in October of last year to provide enrichment services for HALEU, although the DOE also announced plans to contract General Matter for low-enriched uranium in December.\n\nEnrichment is just one step, and kind of a headache, in the nuclear supply chain. Uranium first has to be mined and milled. Naturally occurring uranium has low levels of the isotope U-235 that nuclear fission reactors split to release energy. The uranium has to be converted into gas and then enriched to about a 5 percent concentration of U-235 to make fuel for a traditional reactor. Following a boom in nuclear power plants built in the 1970s and 1980s, however, the industry lost ground to gas-fired power plants generating electricity at lower costs. Nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment plants shuttered across the US.\n\nBut now, the opposite is happening. Microsoft and Meta have inked deals over the past year to revive old reactors. Other tech giants, including Amazon and Google, have committed to supporting companies designing advanced reactors that are supposed to be smaller, easier, and cheaper to build — potentially solving many of the problems that have plagued the nuclear energy industry for years, if they can eventually prove that these technologies are going to be able to perform at commercial scale.\n\nThat’s all driving up demand for uranium enrichment, now seen as a significant bottleneck in the nuclear energy supply chain. General Matter isn’t the only operation seeking to enrich uranium in Paducah. The DOE has had a deal with another company called Global Laser Enrichment (GLE) since 2016 to sell it leftover tails, depleted uranium, from years of enrichment for nuclear weapons and reactors at the site. GLE has been developing a new way to enrich uranium using lasers that’s supposed to be efficient enough to re-enrich uranium tails so that they can be used to make fuel again. General Matter similarly plans to re-enrich depleted uranium tails in Paducah, according to the DOE press release, although we still don’t know what kind of technology it will use to do so.\n\nLaser technology has yet to be used to enrich uranium at commercial scale. Over the past decade, there just wasn’t enough demand for more uranium enrichment capacity in the US to move forward, says Nima Ashkeboussi, vice president of government relations and communications at GLE. Then Russia — a major supplier for nuclear fuel globally — invaded Ukraine, and in 2024, and the US barred imports of uranium from Russia. GLE applied for a license in June to finally start re-enriching the depleted uranium tails at a site adjacent to the Paducah plant, and expects to hear back from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in about 18 months.\n\nIf all goes well, GLE plans to have its facility up and running by 2030 so it can start making the low-enriched uranium traditionally used by existing nuclear reactors. If at least one of the advanced reactors makes it to commercial operation, Ashkeboussi says that’ll be a market signal that it can start producing more highly enriched uranium (called HALEU) that next-generation reactors need. For now, only Russia has the capability to commercially produce HALEU. But already, data centers and AI have been a major driver in reinvigorating nuclear energy, Ashkeboussi tells The Verge. “We see that as a huge growth potential,” he says.\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump administrations have worked toward onshoring the nuclear supply chain again. The US currently has the capacity to enrich about a third of the uranium its nuclear reactors need. For Joe Biden, nuclear energy supported US climate goals of slashing planet-heating pollution by transitioning away from fossil fuels in the power grid. Trump is sabotaging US climate commitments and renewable energy projects, but still says nuclear energy has a role to play when it comes to making sure US tech companies have enough electricity to dominate the AI market.\n\nThe plans for Paducah seem to fit neatly into the Trump administration’s vision for AI, which it released last month. In short, the plan includes fast-tracking the development of energy-hungry data centers in conjunction with primarily fossil fuel and nuclear power plants by limiting environmental reviews.\n\n“It seems their mindset is construction and production at all costs.”\n\nThe rush to build, especially as the Trump administration simultaneously guts the Environmental Protection Agency and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has raised some flags over how much oversight and community participation there will be with these new projects. “I don’t have any confidence in what the administration is doing to protect public health and safety. It seems their mindset is construction and production at all costs,” says Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists that has been critical of the environmental and security risks nuclear energy can pose.\n\nNuclear energy has been a divisive technology among people concerned about climate change and pollution. It’s a carbon pollution-free source of electricity. But uranium mining near the Grand Canyon has already sparked opposition from environmental advocates and the Havasupai Tribe over how it could affect nearby communities and the water sources on which they rely. And the federal government has yet to solve decades of wrangling over where to store radioactive waste from nuclear reactors.\n\nAdding to those concerns, the Trump administration wants to build on federal lands and even repurpose polluted Superfund sites for all this infrastructure. The shuttered enrichment plant in Paducah itself is a Superfund site, which means it’s on a list of places so contaminated that the Environmental Protection Agency has stepped in to prioritize their cleanup. That legacy shows the pitfalls and hurdles that policymakers and companies will have to try to avoid if they want to bring nuclear energy back to small-town USA.\n\n“Regardless of what’s happening with the Trump administration, this is a massively bipartisan undertaking regarding uranium enrichment. There is a lot of support for it right now. I think there’s a lot of momentum to really get it right,” says Rowen Price, senior policy advisor for nuclear energy at the nonprofit Third Way, which supports nuclear energy.\n\n“Just a few years ago, the idea of Kentucky leading the next wave of nuclear energy development may have seemed ambitious,” Sen. Danny Carroll (R-KY) wrote in an op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader. “Paducah is again at the center of America’s nuclear future.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"uranium\", \"reactors\", \"town\", \"enrichment\", \"plans\", \"trump\", \"matter\", \"energy\", \"nuclear\", \"paducah\", \"turn\", \"power\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "527ff30c5d1f4dd0db5515e7965b516fa9a0f276a30bad8cd98e5dfc99e7ea46", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:52:57.885930+00:00"}

I think it's unreasonable to expect a single model personality or style to work for all of that.”\n\nThe remarks followed the chaotic launch of a long-awaited new flagship model, GPT-5, which some users felt had a less friendly and supportive personality. As part of the launch, OpenAI stopped offering users access to the prior model, GPT-4o. It quickly reversed its position after some users rebelled.\n\nChatGPT came out in November 2022 with little fanfare but quickly became the fastest growing tech product in history. The chatbot’s remarkable ability to mimic human communication and problem-solve sparked hope of finally building machines as clever as humans.\n\nBut Altman said that the company had misstepped with the latest release by failing to realize how the model’s change in tone would affect consumers. He noted more customization will be coming to ChatGPT in the near future.\n\n“There will have to be a very different kind of product offering to accommodate the extremely wide diversity of use cases and people,” he said.\n\nAsked if AI is in a bubble, Altman said “for sure,” but added that this hardly means that the underlying technology won’t be transformative. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history [like] the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important, the internet was a really big deal.”\n\nOpenAI will likely spend trillions of dollars on data centers alone in the “not very distant future,” Altman said. “And you should expect a bunch of economists to wring their hands and be like, ‘Oh, this is so crazy, it's so reckless’ ... And we'll just be like, ‘You know what? Let us do our thing.’”\n\nAsked where he plans to find those trillions of dollars, Altman hedged. “I suspect we can design a very interesting new kind of financial instrument for financing compute that the world has not yet figured out,” he said. “We're working on it.”\n\nAt the same time, Altman said that he expects some big AI investments not to pan out, just as some companies’ investors lost out when internet infrastructure was being built out during the dotcom boom. OpenAI raised $40 billion at the end of March to fund its quest to reach AGI, bringing the company’s valuation to $300 billion. If the company goes through with a rumored stock sale, which would allow employees to cash in their shares of the company, it could further inflate OpenAI’s valuation to $500 billion.\n\n“Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money, we don't know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money,” he said. “And my personal belief, although I may turn out to be wrong, is that on the whole, this will be a huge net win for the economy.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"track\", \"openai\", \"chatgpt\", \"tech\", \"humanity\", \"trillions\", \"model\", \"valuation\", \"sam\", \"human\", \"altman\", \"users\", \"company\", \"outtalk\"]", "content_hash": "0194a5a26f99f096435457d8422ea4ef05c7eb946f9a756f7da4a10b7833f176", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:09.375760+00:00"}

While the company didn’t say so explicitly, OpenAI appeared to be taking direct aim at Anthropic’s Claude Code, which has quickly become many developers’ favored tool for AI-assisted coding.\n\nBut developers tell WIRED that GPT-5 has been a mixed bag so far. It shines at technical reasoning and planning coding tasks, but some say that Anthropic’s newest Opus and Sonnet reasoning models still produce better code. Depending on which version of GPT-5 developers are using—low, medium, or high verbosity—the model can be more elaborative, which sometimes leads it to generate unnecessary or redundant lines of code.\n\nSome software engineers have also criticized how OpenAI evaluated GPT-5’s performance at coding, arguing that the benchmarks it used are misleading. One research firm called a graphic that OpenAI published boasting about GPT-5’s capabilities a “chart crime.”\n\nGPT-5 does stand out in at least one way: Several people noted that, in comparison to competing models, it is a much more cost-effective option. “GPT-5 is mostly outperformed by other AI models in our tests, but it’s really cheap,” says Sayash Kapoor, a computer science doctoral student and researcher at Princeton University who cowrote the book AI Snake Oil.\n\nKapoor says he and his team have been running benchmark tests to evaluate GPT-5’s capabilities since the model was released to the public last week. He notes that the standard test his team uses—measuring how well a language model can write code that will reproduce the results of 45 scientific papers—costs $30 to run with GPT-5 set to medium, or mid-range verbosity. The same test using Anthropic’s Opus 4.1 costs $400. In total, Kapoor says his team has spent around $20,000 testing GPT-5 so far.\n\nAlthough GPT-5 is cheap, Kapoor’s tests indicate the model is also less accurate than some of its competitors. Claude’s premium model achieved a 51 percent accuracy rating, measured by how many of the scientific papers it accurately reproduced. The medium version of GPT-5 received a 27 percent accuracy rating. (Kapoor has not yet run the same test using GPT-5 high, so it’s an indirect comparison, given that Opus 4.1 is Anthropic’s most powerful model.)\n\nOpenAI spokesperson Lindsay McCallum referred WIRED to its blog, where it said that it trained GPT-5 on “real-world coding tasks in collaboration with early testers across startups and enterprises.” The company also highlighted some of its internal accuracy measurements for GPT-5, which showed that the GPT-5 “thinking” model, which does more deliberate reasoning, scored highest on accuracy among all of OpenAI’s models. GPT-5 “main,” however, still fell short of previously-released models on OpenAI’s own accuracy scale.\n\nAnthropic spokesperson Amie Rotherham said in a statement that “performance claims and pricing models often look different once developers start using them in production environments. Since reasoning models can quickly use a lot of tokens while thinking, the industry is moving to a world where price per outcome matters more than price per token.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"say\", \"gpt5\", \"reasoning\", \"mixed\", \"models\", \"openai\", \"developers\", \"model\", \"coding\", \"code\", \"accuracy\", \"bag\", \"anthropics\"]", "content_hash": "316d5182a1a5e72b784930bad42ad9b170c28c8dfdfea00cc3dfb9254859510d", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:10.211806+00:00"}

There’s a sense, almost, of the uncanny valley—her presence feels oddly inhuman. His instincts are right, of course, and he’s soon forced to defend himself against a barrage of cruel insults playing on his deepest vulnerabilities. But Wahlberg stays strong. He retains composure as Behar screams at him to get off the stage. “I'll leave, but not because you're kicking me off,” he announces. “I'll leave because I have too much respect for myself to sit here and be abused by someone who's forgotten what decency looks like!” Audience members are stunned—none more so than those watching at home on YouTube, who swiftly thumb in their words of reassurance.\n\n“Way to go Mark.

Except Mark Wahlberg hasn’t been a guest on The View since 2015. The inevitable twist? None of this happened in reality, but rather elapsed over the course of a 25-minute-long fan-fiction-style video, made with the magic of artificial intelligence to potentially fool 460,000 drama-hungry viewers. Hardly surprising given the towering pile of AI slop on the web has reached unpolicable levels—with recent clips so realistic they’re tripping up the most media-literate of Zoomers.\n\nBut perhaps what is surprising about this otherwise unoriginal clash of the titans is that none of this happened in the video, either. Despite its characters’ kinetic confrontation, “Mark Wahlberg Kicked Off The View After Fiery Showdown With Joy Behar” is entirely motionless, save for a grainy filter added over a still image. It entertains its audience simply with an AI voice-over, narrating an LLM-written script laden with clichés as theatrical as “fist-clenching” and “jaw wobbling.” It’s cheap, lazy—the very definition of slop—but somehow, the channel it’s hosted on, Talk Show Gold, has managed to round up over 88,000 subscribers, many of whom express complete disbelief when eventually informed by other commenters that what they are watching is “fake news.”\n\n“These videos are what we might call ‘cheapfakes’ rather than deepfakes, as they’re cobbled together from a motley selection of real images and videoclips, with a basic AI voice-over and subtitles,” explains Simon Clark, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bristol, who specializes in AI-generated misinformation. “At a superficial level, we might be surprised that people would be fooled by something this unsophisticated. But actually there are sound psychological factors at play here,” he adds, explaining that the videos typically focus on rhetorical techniques that encourage audiences to abandon critical thinking skills by calling to emotion.\n\nA WIRED investigation found 120 YouTube channels employing similar tactics. With misleading names like Starfame, Media Buzz, and Celebrity Scoop, they camouflage themselves alongside real compilation clips from shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Today With Jenna & Friends to gain credibility. Their channel descriptions give the illusion of melodramatic tabloid outlets—some bury their AI-disclaimers under walls of text emphasizing “all the best highlights” or “the most unforgettable, hilarious, and iconic moments,” while others omit them entirely to add to the flair.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"mark\", \"behar\", \"voiceover\", \"audience\", \"view\", \"watching\", \"celeb\", \"youtube\", \"wahlberg\", \"ragebaiting\", \"cheapfake\", \"videos\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "32f477c16244786ec20de10efa2f6259b17ef4db9344246a998a87a1d07164d4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:11.025197+00:00"}

FluMist is not a new vaccine. It was originally approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003 and previously could only be administered by a health care professional. But last September, the FDA said the vaccine could be self-administered.\n\nIt’s AstraZeneca’s first foray into direct-to-consumer medicine—a trend being spearheaded by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to sell their popular GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight management to patients.\n\n“We recognized that people's daily lives are busier than ever, and we knew we needed to meet people where they are facing the realities of real life,” said Tonya Villafana, vice president of medical and scientific affairs at AstraZeneca, at a press conference on Thursday. “FluMist Home is designed to remove traditional obstacles to vaccination, things like scheduling clinic visits, waiting in line, and the fear of needles.”\n\nAstraZeneca is hoping that an at-home offering will help boost flu vaccination rates. Only about 47 percent of adults get vaccinated against flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among children, flu vaccination rates are dropping along with those of other routine childhood vaccines. As of April 26 this year, 49.2 percent of children received a flu vaccination—lower than 53.4 percent at the same time the previous season, per the CDC.\n\n“Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the US population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death,” said Peter Marks, former director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement last year on FluMist’s approval for self-administration.\n\nThe CDC classified the 2024-2025 flu season as high severity across all age groups in the US, resulting in at least 610,000 hospitalizations and 27,000 deaths. It was the most severe flu season since the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.\n\nAstraZeneca’s September 2024 approval was based on a study with vaccine recipients and caregivers to evaluate whether the instructions for use were appropriately designed so that they could safely and effectively use the vaccine.\n\nThe vaccine contains a weakened form of the live influenza virus and protects against four types of flu strains. It is approved for ages 2 through 49. For those under 18, it must be administered by a caregiver.\n\nTo order, customers will need to complete a medical screening questionnaire. A licensed health care provider will review each submission to determine eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed and insurance is verified, the vaccine will be prescribed and shipped directly to the purchaser’s home on a date they select. FluMist is covered by most insurance plans, but consumers will need to pay an $8.99 delivery fee.\n\nAstraZeneca says FluMist is not yet available in all states due to local pharmacy laws, but the company aims to be able to provide the at-home spray to all the contiguous states in the future. The vaccine will continue to be available in doctors’ offices and pharmacies for administration by health care professionals across the country.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"care\", \"vaccination\", \"flumist\", \"available\", \"states\", \"health\", \"season\", \"flu\", \"pharmacy\", \"vaccine\"]", "content_hash": "505ab6af9fb11979e75db71da685ed0b989b79e025328596505ae9c87ad2aa3d", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:11.847819+00:00"}

Elon Musk’s xAI was supposed to be part of the initiative, but a planned partnership fell apart after the Grok chatbot spouted antisemitic conspiracy theories on X in early July, WIRED has learned.\n\nThe chaos surrounding the Grok deal reflects the Trump administration's current focus on speed and its disregard, at times, of preexisting norms surrounding government tech procurement.\n\nOn May 15, fresh off a whirlwind trip to the Middle East with President Donald Trump, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sent an email to the leadership team at the General Services Administration (GSA), the federal agency that manages government technology. He was inspired by Trump’s desire to “go big,” he said. “With that in mind, I've been thinking that we need to equip the entire federal workforce with best-in-class AI tools.”\n\nThe email kicked off a swift procurement process. On May 21, OpenAI met with GSA staffers in person to discuss a partnership, according to documents obtained by WIRED. “We discussed identifying strategic ‘top-down’ initiatives, with procurement reform emerging as a promising candidate,” wrote Felipe Millon, who leads federal sales for OpenAI, in an email obtained by WIRED. “OpenAI is prepared to dedicate resources specifically to explore how AI can effectively support and enhance this high priority area for GSA.”\n\nOn August 6, the leading AI startup announced a massive partnership with the GSA that gives federal workers access to ChatGPT Enterprise for a nominal $1 fee for the first year. The deal surprised some federal workers, who claim this amounts to a gift from a tech company and is highly unusual. “It is not typical at all,” says one worker familiar with the procurement process who spoke with WIRED. They noted that while GSA has moved swiftly in the past to onboard new tech tools, accepting what amounts to a “gift” from a tech firm is “atypical.” OpenAI and GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.\n\nOpenAI says it will not use chats with federal workers as training data for future models. The company also confirmed to WIRED that federal employee chats will not be subject to the court order that requires the startup to preserve data from some consumer chats indefinitely.\n\nIn August, the US government also announced partnerships with OpenAI rivals Anthropic and Google Gemini. It also struck a deal with Box, a content management platform powered by AI. The push is part of the Trump administration’s plan to modernize the federal government with an increased reliance on AI tools. It comes on the heels of the president's AI Action Plan unveiled last month, which calls for less regulation and an increase in AI adoption across the government.\n\n“The more silos you have, the more legacy systems you have, the less collaboration there is, the less sharing of important data there is between agencies, the harder it is to make better, more informed decisions in critical areas,” Box CEO Aaron Levie tells WIRED.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"federal\", \"land\", \"openai\", \"tech\", \"xai\", \"trump\", \"praised\", \"grok\", \"procurement\", \"contract\", \"partnership\", \"hitler\", \"workers\", \"major\", \"gsa\", \"wired\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "6281c0ac09803adb2905740eabaa561f90839002ccf72454f57acb087cac78eb", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:12.641822+00:00"}

Earlier this week, Trump said he would allow the company to continue selling its H20 chips to China in exchange for a 15 percent share of the revenues.\n\n“The H20 is obsolete. You know, it’s one of those things, but it still has a market,” Trump said at a press conference on Monday. “So we negotiated a little deal.”\n\nThe unusual and legally dubious arrangement is a striking reversal for the Trump administration, which banned all H20 sales to China earlier this year. The president reportedly changed his mind about the issue after meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has argued that allowing Chinese companies to buy H20s doesn’t pose a risk to US national security.\n\nOn one hand, this is a simple story about a president who appears to have been influenced by a powerful executive lobbying in his company’s interest. But beneath the surface, there’s a much more interesting and complicated saga about how we got here.\n\nNvidia introduced the H20 last year after the US government banned the company from selling a more powerful chip, the H800, to China. The move was part of an ambitious project orchestrated by Biden administration officials who believed the United States needed to prevent China from developing advanced artificial intelligence first.\n\nFor the past few months, I’ve been working closely with Graham Webster, a researcher at Stanford University who sought to understand how and why the Biden team decided the US needed to curb China’s access to advanced semiconductors in the first place. Today, WIRED is publishing Graham’s definitive account of what really happened behind the scenes, based on interviews with more than 10 former US officials and policy experts, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“I did this piece because the official legal justification for the controls, military and human rights, was obviously never the whole story,” Graham told me. “Clearly AI was in the mix, and I wanted to understand why in some depth.”\n\nGraham writes that several key officials in Biden’s White House and Commerce Department “believed AI was approaching an inflection point—or several—that could give a nation major military and economic advantages. Some believed a self-improving system or so-called artificial general intelligence could be just over the technical horizon. The risk that China could reach these thresholds first was too great to ignore.”\n\nSo the Biden team decided to take action. In the fall of 2022, they unveiled broad export controls aimed at preventing China from accessing the most advanced chips required for training powerful AI systems, as well as specialized equipment Beijing needed to modernize its own domestic chipmaking industry.\n\nThe move was the start of a multi-year project that “would reshape relations between the world’s two largest powers and alter the course of what may be one of the most consequential technologies in generations,” Graham writes.\n\nWhat struck me about Graham’s story is just how many people involved in Biden’s export control policies moved on to other influential positions in the world of AI, computing, and national security.

We've listed our favorites above, but even that doesn't cover the wide array of serviceable designs out there for a good night's sleep. If, somehow, all of our picks above aren't to your tastes, here are a few others we have tested and what we thought about them.\n\nAvocado Down Pillow for $109: This down model does have feathers sourced from Responsible Down Standard (RDS)-certified farms, but it felt unimpressive and borderline flat to sleep on\n\nAvocado Green Pillow for $119: Avocado's fill is made from GOLS-certified organic latex and GOTS-certified organic kapok, and comes in both a standard shape and side-sleeper curved shape. It felt much denser than others we tried, and my test panel and I preferred other latex pillows over this one.\n\nBedgear Storm Pillow for $200: This model from Bedgear is similar to the Bedgear Flow above but without the curve for side sleepers. If you sleep on your back 100 percent of the time, this might be a better fit, but I prefer the versatility of having one curved side and one straight side. –Eric Ravenscraft\n\nBrooklinen Down Alternative Pillow for $59: I liked this better than Brooklinen's actual down pillow, since it had better spring and support. (I chose the firm option for testing.) I prefer the Buffy Cloud for a down alternative, but this is a solid runner-up.\n\nCasper Hybrid Pillow for $129: This hybrid uses a mix of thick foam and a core of shredded foam for its marshmallow-like, dense-yet-soft feel. I liked sleeping on the Casper, especially the cooling Snow version ($149), and it did well in my panel tests, but both of my panelists who volunteered to long-term test it came back with disappointing results within a week. My petite side sleeper found it too firm, and my taller, broader long-term tester found that the Casper wasn't bouncing back quite as much as it should be for the price after a week of sleeping on it. If you like a firm-ish design, though, you could be happy with this one. The Snow version is slightly cooling, but not super cooling; more of a good winter option for hot sleepers, as one of my panel testers said.\n\nEli & Elm Everyday Memory Foam Pillow for $110: Compared to the latex version below, the memory foam version feels lumpy. Most of my panelists disliked it, including myself, but my chaotic sleeper was a fan of its malleable shape for her haphazard sleeping patterns.\n\nEli & Elm Everyday Latex Pillow for $110: This shredded latex-filled pillow is nice and springy, and it’s a solid runner-up to the Coop and Purple. I found it comfortable to sleep on as a side sleeper, since it as a higher loft and nice support.\n\nEli & Elm Side Sleeper Pillow for $116: This pillow is almost shockingly firm out of the box. You can customize the amount of fill inside to give it the right amount of support for you, but if you're the type of side sleeper who likes firm support, this might be the one for you. It even comes with a separate removable cover for easy washing. It's smaller than the Scrumptious one, so don't expect to do much cuddling on this one, but for one person it's a great choice. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nGhostBed Memory Foam Pillow for $85: Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using the memory foam GhostBed pillow since 2020—she slept on it while visiting with a friend and immediately bought one after returning home. It's medium-firm and works for her side-, back-, and stomach-sleeping rotation. GhostBed's claim of it being the “Coolest Pillow in the World” is exaggerated, but Medea sleeps hot, and she says the gel-infused foam does stay cool all night.\n\nMarlow the Pillow for $49: This is another shredded memory foam model, though it was less lumpy and had better support than the Eli & Elm. It was a little smaller than the rest, but it also has a slight adjustment option, letting you unzip side panels to make it bigger or smaller. It was fine to sleep on; I found it a little firm for my liking, but my long-term tester says it's been supportive and cleared up her neck pain. It's a good option for the price too.\n\nNest Easy Breather Pillow for $119: This is a popular model, but I found it too dense and too lofty for me. It is adjustable, so you can easily make it less lofty, and it comes with a fill bag to store your extra fill. The fill is a mix of foam and polyester fiber. My panelist who liked the firmer Marlow also liked this pillow, while the rest of us preferred softer options.\n\nNo More Aches Neck Pillow for $50: There's no shortage of novelty pillows, but as someone who experiences a lot of neck pain, I'm intrigued by this odd little design. It has a concave center for back, side, and stomach sleeping, plus an indented edge that perfectly fits your arm. Its awkward shape makes it less than ideal for anything other than laying your head on it, but it's still a solid pick for neck pain. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nParallel High Profile Pillow for $150: Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft was a fan of the Parallel's high profile for taller side sleepers. It's a good option, but I think you'll be just as happy with a Purple or Coop cutout if you need a high loft and side sleeper support.\n\nPillow Cube Side Cube ($70) and Ice Cube ($90): The Pillow Cube has a weird little rectangular design. It seems strange at first, but once you take the quiz and get a recommendation for what size you need, you’ll be matched with the perfect cube for you. I tested the Side Cube and the Ice Cube. They were supportive and a bit squishy, and I think they’d be a good option if you sleep exclusively on your side—with your arms stretched in front of you or near your chest. I usually sleep with my arm stretched under my pillow, so my head is resting on my shoulder (with a pillow in between), and I found the Cube was less supportive if I slept in my preferred position. And on the nights when I rolled onto my back, I woke up with neck pain. But if you only sleep in the ideal side sleeper formation, this model is much more supportive than others I’ve tried. Make sure you pick up a case! A normal case is too roomy and doesn’t fit the Cube well. —Louryn Strampe\n\nPurple DreamLayer Pillow for $199: If you find you switch between being a side sleeper and back sleeper, the Purple DreamLayer pillow provides an excellent middle ground. Rather than using adjustable fill to customize its height, this model comes with two foam inserts so you can get exactly the level of support you need. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nPurple GridCloud Pillow for $149: This pillow is a softer, squishier design with the grid layer we love from the Purple Freeform and Harmony, but it has only one side with the grid instead of two. It's described as having a down-alternative core, and it does feel much softer, like a down alternative. I preferred the support of Purple's other models, but if you want something softer with better support than just a down or down alternative filling, this is a great option.\n\nSaatva Graphite Memory Foam Pillow for $165: This model is slightly cooling, and has a fluffier feel compared to more sinkage-style memory foam.\n\nSaatva Down Alternative Pillow for $115: I like this down alternative, but not more than the much cheaper Buffy. There are two loft height options which is nice if you want something specific.\n\nSleep Number True Temp Adapt Ultimate Pillow for $150: I tested the Ultimate shape since it's a slight crescent-like style that's ideal for side sleepers like myself. I like this as a side sleeper option, and it's nicely cooling as well. It's a little smaller than the Coop, but still big enough for the average-sized person.\n\nSlumber Cloud UltraCool Pillow for $79: This pillow is super chilly and super soft, similar to a down or down alternative model. If you're looking for something extra cool and like the light, malleable support of a down pillow, this is a good choice.\n\nSnuggle-Pedic Adjustable Cooling Pillow for $57: This was our favorite pillow under $100, but it's out of stock everywhere right now. If you can find it available, it's a great option filled with shredded memory foam that you can adjust to get your perfect height.\n\nTempur-Pedic Tempur-Adapt ProAdjust Pillow for $125: This adjustable-fill model from Tempur-Pedic has a compartment where you can add or remove foam filling to get the perfect amount of support for you. This is an increasingly common feature, but what sets it apart is Tempur-Pedic's trademark cooling materials. The company makes some of the best cooling materials on the market, and this one managed to stay cooler than most I tried. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nTempur Pedic Tempur Adapt ProHi for $175: Our previous memory foam pick did fine in my panel tests, but we all preferred shredded memory foam over a solid sheet. Someone did volunteer to long-term test this as a knee support while they slept, though.\n\nTempur-Breeze ProHi Pillow for $229: is a wider, more spacious alternative to the Tempur-Adapt ProHi. It has a similarly high loft, and the foam is firmer and more resistant to pressure than the Adapt. It's a better fit if you prefer a firmer option, or if you want space to share it with your cuddling partner. —Eric Ravenscraft\n\nUnderstanding Pillow Sizes\n\nThere are a couple different pillow sizes you might find when shopping. Most of the time pillows come in a standard size and a king size, and you should buy a standard size unless you have a king-size bed. But there are a few more size options.\n\nAll bed pillows are usually 20 inches wide, but the length can vary. (That's why your pillowcases might seem too long—they're prepared for larger sizes!) If you're curious about more sizes or found a model that has more options to choose from than you know what to do with, here are the usual sizes you can find and what measurements they should have:\n\nStandard Size: 20 inches by 26 inches\n\n20 inches by 26 inches Super Standard Size: 20 inches by 28 inches\n\n20 inches by 28 inches Queen: 20 inches by 30 inches\n\n20 inches by 30 inches King: 20 inches by 36 inches\n\n20 inches by 36 inches Body: 20 inches by 54 inches\n\nYou'll want to double-check listings to see what size you're really working with if size is an issue for you. Buffy, for example, lists a standard size for its pillows, but they're 28 inches long, making those pillows a super standard size. You won't want to order king-size pillows without a king-sized bed, especially since you'll need king-size pillowcases with your sheets. Body pillows are the longest of all, and we have a separate guide to those.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions What Kind of Pillow Do You Need? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron You might think a pillow is a pillow. It just has to be soft and fit under your head, right? Your head, neck, and back disagree. Getting a good night’s sleep can depend heavily on your pillow, so when choosing one, here are a few key questions to ask. What kind of sleeper are you? Do you sleep on your back, side, or stomach? Do you stay relatively still, or do you toss and turn a lot? Do you usually have one pillow under your head, or do you cocoon yourself into a pillow chrysalis? This is probably the most important thing to keep in mind when deciding what type works best for you, and we've noted our picks below based on sleeping style. What is the pillow made of? Pillows can be filled with all types of materials, from feathers to foam. Down and synthetic down are fluffy clusters of fiber that can feel soft and comfortable, whereas memory foam is designed to compress with the weight of your head but still return to its previous shape. Organic latex can be heavy and spongey, holding a side-sleeper's head in place. There are also hybrid pillows that use multiple layers of different materials for a more structured feel. How are the materials sourced? Since some materials like down feathers come from animals, you might want to be aware of how manufacturers get their fill (literally). Down filling typically comes from the belly feathers of either ducks or geese. In order to ensure that down feathers are ethically sourced—such as by avoiding cruel practices like live plucking—programs like the Responsible Down Standard set criteria that manufacturers must adhere to. Another option is to look for synthetic down alternatives, which use cotton, rayon, or polyester as a synthetic replacement. The broader Material Matters Standard is a recently overhauled system for examining the environmental impact and sustainability of bedding manufacturers. How firm is it? However you sleep, you'll want a pillow that keeps your spine straight and your head aligned with your back. That means you want something firm enough to support your head yet soft enough that it doesn't dig into your ear or face. How lofty is it? “Loft” is a term often used to describe how high off the bed the pillow keeps your head. If it's too tall, for example, you might end up with your neck tilted upward, straining it throughout the night. Most models typically fall into one of three categories: Low loft, which is relatively short and ideal for back sleepers; high loft, which is better for side sleepers (since your head will be further off the bed than when you're on your back); and medium loft, which is somewhere in the middle and best if you're a combination sleeper who doesn't stick to one particular sleep style. What is the warranty and return policy? You might not think the pillow you sleep (and sweat and drool) on would have a robust warranty, but many manufacturers offer generous policies. For example, Purple offers a one-year warranty and even a 100-night trial period. Casper has a similar warranty and a 30-day trial. If you're unsure whether your new pillow is right for you, check out the company's policies to see what leeway you have to try before you commit—and make sure you’re protected if something goes wrong. What's the Best Pillow Fill for You? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron A variety of filling materials are used, and the type of fill is a big part of how pillows are categorized. You've heard of down pillows, for example, which means it's full of down undercoating or feathers, and hearing the words “memory foam” usually invokes the sinking sensation that good memory foam can give. Here's a quick explainer of the main types of fill you'll find and how they differ. Down: Down pillows, as I mentioned above, are filled with either down clusters (an undercoating on ducks) or down feathers, or a mix of both. It's a fill that's been around for ages, and it feels similar to a comforter in the sense that it's soft and squishy, and very malleable to shape in any way you prefer. (But it also doesn't retain its shape well.) Since these are filled with down clusters or feathers, you'll want to check for certifications, like the Responsible Down Standard (RDS), that confirm if the down was ethically sourced. Down alternative: These pillows aren't a set type, but use other materials to replicate the down experience. Buffy, for example, uses recycled plastic to create their fill, while Saatva uses a combination of memory foam and latex foam. You'll have to take a look to see what makes up any down alternative design, since it isn't consistent. But what is consistent is the different feel. In my tests, I've found down alternative models are usually more supportive and do a better job holding their shape than a classic down. Memory foam: Memory foam is popular since it can “remember” its original shape, letting it return to its previous form once your head is off the pillow. Memory foam does have a sinking sensation to it, which you might like or dislike. You'll also want to check if the memory foam is a solid sheet or shredded; I've found shredded and cut memory foam to have more bounce and support and less sinkage than a memory foam sheet. Latex foam: Latex foam is made from rubber, giving it a much bouncier, supportive feel than other foam options. Latex foam is becoming a popular option thanks to that nice support, and it is usually found with a shredded type of fill that gives plenty of airflow. Hybrid: Hybrid is another category gaining in popularity. It can be a mix of any of the above fills, but I often find it's a sheet of foam combined with either shredded foam or some other kind of softer filling. Casper, for example, uses both sheets of memory foam and then has a core of shredded foam at the center to give it its marshmallow-like feel. Cotton, kapok, and wool: These fills are all natural fibers that take less processing than foam, and could be used in a blend with other materials above. Kapok and cotton are supposed to be on the fluffy end, while wool is great for temperature regulation. But none are as popular as foam or down options, though you might see these as ingredients in organic or hybrid options. Are Standard and Queen the Same Pillow Size? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron No, a standard size is a little smaller at only 26 inches wide, while a queen size should be 30 inches wide. You might want to check the measurements in case it's mislabeled to be the same thing, but if you have the choice between the two, I prefer a few extra inches with the queen size. Why Should You Spend So Much on a Pillow? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron You might be surprised by some of the price tags on these pillows. I remember spending bottom dollar on my pillows for years. But those bottom-dollar pillows needed to be frequently replaced and didn't provide the long-term support (or even all-night support) my neck needed. Higher-quality pillows cost more but will use better materials, last longer, and come with trial periods and warranties so that you can test out the pillow of your choice and get a guarantee it'll last. Plus, while most of these aren't cheap, it's still an affordable investment when you break down how many hours you'll be lying on them. How Should You Care for Your Pillow? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The best way to wash your pillow is going to depend on the pillow you have. You can choose to hand wash, spot clean, or machine wash pillows, though you'll want to check the label and make sure it's safe to machine wash it. If it's not, spot or hand cleaning is your best option. The easiest pillows to clean are ones that come with removable covers, because you can remove said cover and wash it with other sheets and bedding. Not all pillow fill should be washed, so that's important to check before throwing an entire pillow into your washing machine. Our top five picks all have removable covers for easy washing, though for some (like the Honeydew Scrumptious) you'll have to manually remove the filling and store it in a bag, while others like the Purple have a separated cover and fill section. How Does WIRED Choose Pillows to Review? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We research all pillows we test to make sure we test a variety of styles, fills, and shapes to find which are the most supportive over a night's sleep. We test both expensive and affordably priced models to see how the quality stacks up, and usually look to test new designs and options to see what's coming next (and every other category we test for). We also check out reviews and customer feedback when available to see if it's worth testing to compare against pillows we know we already like. How Does WIRED Test Pillows? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Every pillow in this guide is slept on for a minimum of three nights, with our top picks getting at least a week if not closer to a month of sleep testing from either myself, other staffers, or long-term testers. I also hosted a testing panel in March 2025 with six participants and 22 different models. The panelists all had different sleep styles ranging from classic side and back sleepers to chaotic sleepers who end up underneath their pillows every night, and the panel judged which options they found most comfortable and would be most likely to buy for their sleep needs. How Does WIRED Acquire Pillows? What Happens to the Review Units After Testing? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Most of our pillows are provided by the company for us to review, sometimes by that company reaching out to offer its newest model for us to consider, or more frequently, us reaching out and asking to test it after researching that specific style or fill type. We also purchase some pillows for ourselves and will write about them. After we test pillows, they're either placed with a long-term tester if the model is a pick, or they're donated.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

One of its early investors was in QTEL, which is the CIA's venture capital arm. And two of Palantir's cofounders are pretty well-known. Peter Thiel, we've talked about a few times on this show, and Alex Karp, seem like they have intentionally wanted to position the company as a government and military partner, which, like we said earlier, inevitably comes with some secrecy.\n\nMichael Calore: We need to take a break now, but when we come back, we're going to dive further into those founders that you just talked about, Lauren, and we're going to break down how their vision of a techno state has shaped the company, and what it can mean for our collective future.\n\nWelcome back to Uncanny Valley. Before the break, WIRED's Caroline Haskins was telling us all about Palantir services, and how the company actually works with data and the software that it sells to organizations. But it's through looking at two of Palantir's cofounders, particularly Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, that the company's identity starts to come into sharper focus.\n\nPeter Thiel almost needs no introduction. We've talked about him on the show before. And besides being one of the cofounders of Palantir, he used to be part of the so-called PayPal Mafia, and has gathered widespread attention for his support of the current administration and other GOP candidates. Alex Karp is the current CEO of Palantir, and he co-founded the company alongside Thiel and a few other people in 2003. So from the start, what vision did they set up for the company?\n\nCaroline Haskins: I feel like maybe a useful way into that is to talk about some of the internal jargon that Palantir uses. I mean, even just externally, the name Palantir actually comes from Lord of the Rings. It's this idea of an all-seeing stone that can look across vast expanses of land in the present, or go into the past. So the whole idea of that is to provide a product to that is seemingly extremely powerful and can go wherever you would need it to go. But then I guess internally, I think employees have really adopted this attitude that they are solving the world's most difficult problems and making the world a better place.\n\nSo, they've kept with the Lord of the Rings language, even just talking amongst each other. Employees call themselves internally, since really the early days of the company, they've called each other hobbits. To the best of my knowledge. I'm not sure how popular this phrase is these days, but a motto that was circulated internally was Save the Shire. So it does get back to this idea of, we're trying to save the world, we're trying to make the world a better place, we're trying to catch terrorists. We're trying to do these really difficult things that make the world a better place-", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"palantir\", \"mean\", \"silicon\", \"trying\", \"thiel\", \"valley\", \"need\", \"mysterious\", \"decoding\", \"world\", \"talked\", \"karp\", \"company\", \"really\"]", "content_hash": "5fe2e26fe5df26af09799171da5debde62b64a6be3a0a8dd6da5354d8072cca1", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:17.006878+00:00"}

The backlash shows the challenge of building artificial intelligence systems that exhibit anything like real emotional intelligence.\n\nResearchers at MIT have proposed a new kind of AI benchmark to measure how AI systems can manipulate and influence their users—in both positive and negative ways—in a move that could perhaps help AI builders avoid similar backlashes in the future while also keeping vulnerable users safe.\n\nMost benchmarks try to gauge intelligence by testing a model’s ability to answer exam questions, solve logical puzzles, or come up with novel answers to knotty math problems. As the psychological impact of AI use becomes more apparent, we may see MIT propose more benchmarks aimed at measuring more subtle aspects of intelligence as well as machine-to-human interactions.\n\nAn MIT paper shared with WIRED outlines several measures that the new benchmark will look for, including encouraging healthy social habits in users; spurring them to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills; fostering creativity; and stimulating a sense of purpose. The idea is to encourage the development of AI systems that understand how to discourage users from becoming overly reliant on their outputs or that recognize when someone is addicted to artificial romantic relationships and help them build real ones.\n\nChatGPT and other chatbots are adept at mimicking engaging human communication, but this can also have surprising and undesirable results. In April, OpenAI tweaked its models to make them less sycophantic, or inclined to go along with everything a user says. Some users appear to spiral into harmful delusional thinking after conversing with chatbots that role play fantastic scenarios. Anthropic has also updated Claude to avoid reinforcing “mania, psychosis, dissociation or loss of attachment with reality.”\n\nThe MIT researchers led by Pattie Maes, a professor at the institute’s Media Lab, say they hope that the new benchmark could help AI developers build systems that better understand how to inspire healthier behavior among users. The researchers previously worked with OpenAI on a study that showed users who view ChatGPT as a friend could experience higher emotional dependence and experience “problematic use”.\n\nValdemar Danry, a researcher at MIT’s Media Lab who worked on this study and helped devise the new benchmark, notes that AI models can sometimes provide valuable emotional support to users. “You can have the smartest reasoning model in the world, but if it's incapable of delivering this emotional support, which is what many users are likely using these LLMs for, then more reasoning is not necessarily a good thing for that specific task,” he says.\n\nDanry says that a sufficiently smart model should ideally recognize if it is having a negative psychological effect and be optimized for healthier results. “What you want is a model that says ‘I’m here to listen, but maybe you should go and talk to your dad about these issues.’”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"gpt5\", \"mit\", \"intelligence\", \"need\", \"dislike\", \"reasoning\", \"models\", \"model\", \"doesnt\", \"benchmark\", \"emotional\", \"youit\", \"systems\", \"users\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "c0d9b14a58fc166369c576839610946ba03ff58d1aa351af632318f0b6f61ea1", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:19.753092+00:00"}

If successful, Texas Republicans would be able to take as many as five seats away from the Democrats in Congress by gerrymandering their districts well before the 2030 Census. This mid-decade gerrymandering could be met by an equal reaction from California, Illinois and New York, all large blue states with several Republican-held seats.\n\nIn response, and in order to block the new map from being implemented, Democratic representatives from Texas fled the state. Their goal is to break quorum in the legislature to prevent a vote on the new map before the end of the special session on August 19.

She’s too young to type—let alone have her own account on Character.AI—but that hasn’t stopped her from nabbing his phone to have voice conversations with a Sherlock Holmes bot, which she uses to build her own mystery stories.\n\nCharacter.AI is an AI companion startup (though Anand likes to say it's an AI role-play startup, which we’ll get into later). He took over as the CEO in June in the midst of a potentially devastating lawsuit for its parent company and looming questions about child safety. When I ask if he’s concerned about his daughter connecting with an AI chatbot rather than a real human, he’s quick to say no.\n\n“It is very rarely, in any of these scenarios, a true replacement for any human,” Anand told me during a video call late last week. ”It's very clearly noted in the app that, hey, this is a role-play and an entertainment, so you will never start going deep into that conversation, assuming that it is your actual companion.”\n\nIt's a delicate moment for Character.AI.\n\nLast August, Google swooped in with a roughly $2.7 billion deal to license Character.AI’s technology. As part of the agreement, Character.AI’s two cofounders left for Google’s AI division.\n\nAnand, who previously worked as the VP of business products at Meta, was tasked with picking up the pieces—which he did in part by leaving behind the founding mission of delivering personalized superintelligence to focus on AI entertainment.\n\n“What we gave up was this aspiration that the founders had of building AGI models—we are no longer doing that. That is the hundreds of billions of dollars investment fight, which Big Tech is fighting,” Anand says. “What we got in return was clarity and focus, being able to singularly pursue the AI entertainment vision.”\n\nAs part of this change in strategy, Character.AI is no longer trying to build its own frontier models. “The last six months, we've done a lot of work to get off of our proprietary models on text and start using open source models,” Anand says. The company has tested a few: Meta’s Llama, Alibaba’s Qwen, and DeepSeek. “The open source models are beating any proprietary model hands down,” Anand claims.\n\nRunning an AI startup without billions of dollars in revenue can be a brutal equation, and Character.AI is still figuring out how to make the math work. The company told me it's generating revenue at a run rate of more than $30 million and is on track to reach $50 million in revenue by the end of the year. When I asked Anand how many users pay for the $10 monthly subscription, he didn’t give a number but noted “monetization wasn't a focus till four or five months ago.”\n\n“Since I've been on board, it's very clear we do need to monetize. And we've had, I think, almost 250 percent subscriber growth in the last six months. So the paid user base is growing quite, quite well,” Anand says.

Even before it became clear that this might be the wildest public launch in years, the Figma world—fans of the app, employees (known as Figmates), and investors—had already turned Wall Street into a block party, handing out swag, serving free pizza, and blasting music from a DJ that shook the caverns of mammon. But the sweetest music played out on the Big Board, as the opening $33 share price skyrocketed to $142 before settling down at a comfortable $90.\n\nBy the time Field flew back to California, he was worth more than $5 billion. But he doesn’t want to talk about that. The story, in his mind, is not about a company going public, but the IPO of design itself. “What I care most about is what our product will be in 5 years, 10 years,” he says. “Are we progressing design forward?”\n\nNot focusing on the money is probably a good idea. On the day we are speaking, Figma’s stock price dropped 27 percent, cutting its valuation from around $60 billion to just over $40 billion. That’s still way higher than anyone expected. While Figma’s IPO celebrates design, it isn’t the only company hoping to revolutionize the field. AI will initiate a new era in design. Figma, like its competitors, will be defined by how it handles that technology. Ultimately, it’s still not clear whether AI will help its business or blow it up.\n\nField Work\n\nEvery time I talk to Field, it seems like something monumental is happening to Figma, the company he cofounded as a 19-year-old Thiel fellow and a dropout from Brown University. From the start, Figma’s browser-based app allowed people to collaborate and brainstorm about design online. It grew a loyal following, threatening the giant in design tools, Adobe. During our first meeting in 2022, I pressed Field on that David and Goliath trope—and whether he might pull an Instagram and sell out to a bigger company. Field nobly talked about how he was in it for the long haul. In fact, he had a secret he couldn’t share: Adobe had just offered $20 billion for his company, and he was going to take it. The news broke weeks after our conversation. When I confronted him about that at the WIRED conference in San Francisco last December, he apologized. “I felt so bad about that,” he told me.\n\nThe next time we talked, in December 2023, that deal had just fallen apart, because former President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice indicated it would object to the merger. Field was clearly shaken but determined to carry on with his original plan to build a company that would change the way people create apps, websites, docs, and decks. It wasn’t easy, as months of momentum had been squandered preparing to merge with the bigger firm.\n\nOver the next two years, Figma expanded its offerings and kept winning fans. Its 13 million users only hint at its ubiquity: work produced on its app is seen by billions of people. Among Fortune 500 companies, 95 percent use the product. Figma turns a profit. And post-IPO, even after its stock leveled off, the company is worth more than twice what Adobe was going to pay for it.\n\nStill, I was a bit baffled that Field felt it necessary to IPO when startups these days can reach stratospheric valuations without the mishigas of accountability that comes from becoming a public firm. Field cites the virtues of community ownership, the corporate hygiene of following the reporting rules, and how the option to buy shares in Figma will lead people to understand its business better. Ultimately, he says, “If you’re going to go public eventually, why not do it now?”\n\nDesign or Lose\n\nAs is custom for many tech leaders going public, Field wrote a founder’s letter in the prospectus in which he pledged higher values than profits. (Those vows typically wind up haunting their authors as the scrappy entrepreneurs morph into yacht-seeking profit-hounds.) Essentially, the letter is an argument that design now has a central place in peoples’ lives. It’s not just an important factor in the way people build products and express themselves: it’s the factor. “Design,” he wrote, “is bigger than design.” When I ask what he meant by that, he doesn’t unpack the koan too easily. “It’s something that can mean a lot of things,” he says. “It’s the rise of design going from pixel level craft to more general problem solving, to how you win or lose.”\n\nHe explains that in the early 2000s, design was about making things pretty. By the 2010s, people were emulating Steve Jobs’ philosophy that design was about function. Now, Field says, design is not only both those things, but our means of communication—who you are, what your brand stands for, how you engage with the public. Our world is built on software, Field says, and the more software is created, the more design becomes the core differentiator. It’s our new language, and Figma wants to be the Duolingo for those striving to master it.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"dylan\", \"field\", \"things\", \"ipoand\", \"stock\", \"fields\", \"design\", \"plans\", \"figma\", \"inside\", \"going\", \"way\", \"billion\", \"public\", \"bigger\", \"company\", \"big\"]", "content_hash": "03124fc91824c198f8706515ec3e61cc0ef503978c534f1e046a5da58cfd3188", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:22.174149+00:00"}

What they advertised was fairly benign on its surface: fitness, community, preparation, survivalist training. The video was set to the tune of Kendrick Lamar’s “TV Off” and featured a rapid succession of highly edited images showing armed men posing in the wilderness in tactical gear. They sometimes wore skeleton masks, and everyone had their faces entirely concealed or censored. In many of the images, crucifixes are seen visibly dangling from their necks or sewn onto clothing.\n\nIn another post from earlier this year, one of the group's purported members shared a photo of a young man holding an assault weapon with a crucifix displayed over a plaid shirt and his face blurred out. The caption cites Psalm 19:1: “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim his handiwork.\" That quotation is followed by a series of hashtags, including “#militia,” “#wellregulated militia,” “#northeastguerillas,” and “#modernminutemen.”\n\nThis group is part of a new guard of paramilitary activists whose youthful membership, edgy aesthetics, use of Instagram, and, in many cases, overt nods to religion points to a new brand of anti-government Christian nationalist militias.\n\nMany of these new groups, whose follower counts range from dozens to thousands, began quietly setting up shop on Instagram over the past two years. The Tech Transparency Project, which monitors extremism online, identified nearly 200 Instagram accounts as “militia related” and categorized dozens of those as part of this new generation of Christian nationalist militias.\n\nOver time, these groups have continued to grow their audience on Instagram, publishing slick propaganda imagery from IRL meetups that often shows groups of armed men with their faces covered or censored. Many of the Christian nationalist groups on Instagram try to hide behind what appear to be businesses—operating merch stores, for example, that are linked to their accounts, which they can use to fund themselves through sales of apparel, tactical gear, patches, or even weapons training.\n\nExperts say that this emergent movement draws on a number of trends in the modern extremist landscape, including that it establishes a paramilitary wing of surging Christian nationalism in the US and reflects the sensibilities of a new generation of fitness-obsessed, “Christ-pilled” young men, some of who call themselves tradcaths. (This is the name for the highly online, far-right community who churn out provocative memes promoting an idiosyncratic interpretation of what they claim to be traditional Catholicism.)\n\nThis movement is also growing at a time when the traditional militia movement has been left aging, rudderless, and paranoid since January 6, 2021. The fact that the movement is made up of small autonomous cells loosely connected online is also in keeping with the shift toward hyper-local extremist organizing seen in the past few years.\n\nWhile the old guard of paramilitary groups looked to Facebook as fertile ground for reaching and radicalizing prospective recruits, this younger generation of wannabe militants use Instagram like any influencer would—commenting on each other's posts or tagging one another as a way to cross-promote, boost their own followings, and strengthen their networks. “It's basically turning ideology into influencer culture,” says Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project. “Instagram is the best platform for that. It’s one of the platforms that influencers have broadly flocked to because they can monetize it easily. It's very visual, and it's been increasingly incorporating features you have on Facebook, like private group messages.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"group\", \"instagram\", \"paramilitary\", \"movement\", \"groups\", \"militants\", \"using\", \"christian\", \"influencers\", \"process\", \"nationalist\", \"militia\", \"recruitand\", \"men\", \"online\"]", "content_hash": "e253a4b8cef5decdfe98a8f90ed8f93d254ddd355f6e1e306624b7aea21b359e", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:23.071014+00:00"}

Its ubiquity was clearly not lost on the Department of Homeland Security’s communications team. Late last month, DHS published a video to its social accounts that incorporated the \"Nothing Beats a Jet2 Holiday\" tune alongside footage of ICE detainees in handcuffs boarding a deportation plane. The post was captioned: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”\n\nTo many of the administration’s supporters, who responded to the Jet2 holiday post with crying-laughing emojis and American flags, the video was hilarious. One commenter wrote, “I thought this was a meme account at first!”\n\nIn recent months, official government social media accounts—primarily for the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the White House—have resembled parodies of themselves. But experts say it’s intentional: The memes these accounts share are core to the Trump administration’s propaganda strategy. Through them, with attempts at Gen Z humor as the gateway, the administration reinforces an “us vs. them” mindset. Along with normalizing mass deportation, they also tap into Christian nationalist narratives and reach young men via callous jokes that have been recycled through the far-right online ecosystem.\n\nA post on June 28 featured four alligators wearing ICE hats, intended to advertise the detention facility in Florida’s Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” On July 2, DHS shared a video of a border patrol agent looking through a scope, trained on blurry night-vision images of purported migrants attempting to cross the border. The video was published with the popular TikTok song “Somebody’s Watching Me” by Chico Rose x 71 Digits. The caption warns: “You’re not wrong.” A video shared on July 24 showed footage of ICE detainees boarding a deportation flight, with the caption “Boarding now: Criminal illegal aliens. Next stop: Literally anywhere but here.” The post was accompanied by Frank Sinatra’s breezy classic “Come Fly With Me.” Libs of TikTok, a far-right and anti-LGBTQ social account with millions of followers, reposted that video, along with three crying-laughing emojis.\n\nAnd last week, DHS published an ICE recruitment poster that used an old magazine ad for the 1982 “King of Clubs,” a Ford Club Wagon vehicle, along with the text “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” The move from viral sensation to DHS meme is particularly clear here: The image was originally shared a week earlier by O.W. Root, a style columnist for The Blaze. A small account with 364 followers quote-tweeted the post, with the caption “imagine monitoring the situation with your boys here.” That post went viral. Days later, the image, along with a similar caption, appeared on DHS’s social accounts.\n\nThe fact that the government is now integrating the casual cruelty of the highly online far-right into its public messaging shows the degree to which it’s escaped containment. It’s also indicative of the demographic the administration is attempting to reach. The Trump administration is looking to hire 14,050 ICE officers over the next three years to bolster deportation operations. Although the agency just removed age limits from prospective applicants, it now appears they’re trying to use humor to make ICE seem like some sort of fun fraternity.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"jet2\", \"post\", \"viral\", \"deportation\", \"joke\", \"ice\", \"caption\", \"trump\", \"video\", \"mass\", \"using\", \"dhs\", \"administration\", \"turn\", \"big\", \"memes\", \"social\"]", "content_hash": "80b005c602f454751415c91572a40cc4216677a612275163e7224de674b984de", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:23.903604+00:00"}

They believe that white people and Western culture are facing extinction due to an influx of immigrants and minorities, and according to the group’s founder, access to the community is open only to people of white European ancestry who share common views on topics such as segregation, abortion, and gender identity.\n\nVideo footage shared by the group on its social media accounts show a bucolic setting with animals and children running around their 160-acre site, while members of the community build timber-frame homes, churches, and other facilities. A “few dozen” people are already living there full time, says Eric Orwoll, the group’s president.\n\nThough the organization claims that Return to the Land is nothing more than a peaceful settlement of like-minded people, the online histories of the group’s leaders tell a different story. Members have espoused virulently racist and antisemitic views and repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. One of the leaders says he is currently under criminal investigation in Ecuador. Orwoll himself has spoken about the coming of a second Hitler and praised KKK leader David Duke. He is also closely aligned to an international network of far-right influencers, extremists, and white supremacists, including Thomas Sewell, a neo-Nazi living in Australia who was the founder of a group that influenced the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter.\n\nDespite this, the Return to the Land community has been lauded by far-right influencers and has already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.\n\nReturn to the Land, which was first reported on by The Forward and Sky News, is actively scouting for other locations to create a network of similar communities across the country, with a development in Missouri apparently in the works. Inspired in part by the Silicon Valley-based concept of the “network state” and by a white separatist community in South Africa known as Orania, the group promotes itself on its website as a community designed to “promote strong families with common ancestry, and raise the next generation in an environment that reflects our traditional values.”\n\n“They use a lot of innocuous language,” Morgan Moon, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, tells WIRED. “Instead of saying they want to make a white ethnic community, they say they want to make a strong community of common ancestry. But at the same time, when we see their promotional videos and propaganda, what we see is that when they're depicting the failing modern society, they use imagery consisting of minority groups or the LGBT+ community. When they're showing the idealized parallel society that they're attempting to create with Return to the Land, they tend to only use white Aryan imagery.”\n\nOrwoll has spent years building up an audience of like-minded followers on social media, primarily on YouTube, where he speaks about Western culture and philosophy.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"return\", \"group\", \"community\", \"land\", \"common\", \"white\", \"inside\", \"whites\", \"arkansas\", \"groups\", \"theyre\", \"network\", \"ancestry\"]", "content_hash": "2364743eb2972f5cc37ef998d3fa291610530899d97576586430ea073a3d0802", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:24.739427+00:00"}

None previously responded to requests for comment during the investigation.\n\nCalifornia law requires brokers to provide a way to delete personal data; however, the investigation found dozens of registered brokers obscuring their opt-out tools by hiding them from Google and other search results. Consumer advocates called it a “clever work-around” that undermines privacy rights and may qualify as an illegal dark pattern—a design decision that, according to California’s privacy regulator, erodes consumer “autonomy, decision making, or choice when asserting their privacy rights or consenting.”\n\nHassan wants the firms to justify the placement of their opt‑out pages; acknowledge whether they used code to block search indexing and, if so, against how many users; pledge to remove any such code by September 3; and provide Congress with recent audit results and steps taken since the investigation, if any, to improve user access.\n\n“Data brokers and other online providers have a responsibility to prevent the misuse of consumer data, and Americans deserve to understand if and how their personal information is being used,” Hassan wrote, citing other tactics variously employed by the firms—forcing users to scroll through multiple screens, dismiss needless pop-ups, and hunt for links in shrunken text.\n\nBehind the scenes, data brokers fuel a multibillion-dollar industry that trades in detailed personal information—often gathered without a person’s knowledge or consent. They compile sprawling dossiers often packed with precise location histories, political leanings, and religious affiliations, then sell and resell those profiles, powering everything from hyper‑targeted ads to law‑enforcement surveillance.\n\nEven among the small share of Americans who know this surveillance ecosystem exists, fewer still grasp its true scale—or the ways it can shape, influence, or intrude on their lives.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration quietly abandoned a proposed rule that would have sharply limited brokers’ collection and sale of Americans’ data by treating certain brokers as “consumer reporting agencies” under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. At the same time, contract documents show the US intelligence community is preparing a centralized marketplace to streamline purchases of commercially available data—giving agencies shared access to large repositories of sensitive information without the court orders otherwise required for traditional surveillance.\n\nFor survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, the risks are acute. The National Network to End Domestic Violence’s Safety Net Project warns that data brokers collect and sell vast amounts of information that can put survivors at risk, adding that opting out is already a burdensome, piecemeal process, forcing people to contact companies one by one, navigate hard-to-find forms, and resubmit deletion requests regularly as information is re-collected and re-listed.\n\n“Instead of requiring people to navigate byzantine labyrinths to protect their personal information, these companies have a responsibility to make the tools that allow Americans to exercise their right to privacy easy to find and use,” Hassan tells WIRED.\n\nSean Vitka, the executive director of Demand Progress, a nonprofit advocacy group critical of the industry, compares the surveillance ecosystem underlying commercial data markets to the knotted tails of a rat king—an inseparable tangle of entities sustained by unchecked data flows. “The damage done by data brokers manifests in countless ways,” he says, “but it’s all enabled by the same predatory abuse of consumers’ data.”\n\n“And consistent with what we’re seeing here, the industry cannot be trusted to mitigate its own harms.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"consumer\", \"hiding\", \"google\", \"results\", \"pressure\", \"pages\", \"brokers\", \"data\", \"privacy\", \"information\", \"americans\", \"optout\", \"search\", \"personal\", \"face\"]", "content_hash": "5c2107ca63a633bec7a1e2f13aebe6457dfb148b8b039874682c15b2d815826b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:25.591784+00:00"}

This creates one more obstacle for consumers who want to delete their data.\n\nThis story is copublished with The Markup and CalMatters.\n\nMany of the pages containing the instructions, listed in an official state registry, use code to tell search engines to remove the page entirely from search results. Popular tools like Google and Bing respect the code by excluding pages when responding to users.\n\nData brokers nationwide must register in California under the state’s Consumer Privacy Act, which allows Californians to request that their information be removed, that it not be sold, or that they get access to it.\n\nAfter reviewing the websites of all 499 data brokers registered with the state, we found 35 had code to stop certain pages from showing up in searches.\n\nWhile those companies might be fulfilling the letter of the law by providing a page consumers can use to delete their data, it means little if those consumers can’t find the page, according to Matthew Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports who studies the California law governing data brokers and other privacy issues.\n\n“This sounds to me like a clever work-around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it,” Schwartz said.\n\nAfter The Markup and CalMatters contacted the data brokers, eight said they would review the code on their websites or remove it entirely, and another two said they had independently deleted the code before being contacted. The Markup and CalMatters confirmed nine of the 10 companies removed the code.\n\nTwo companies said they added the code intentionally to avoid spam at the recommendation of experts and would not change it.

This type of robbery is enjoying a new wave of popularity, and it is much harder to spot given how quickly those transactions take place. But how much risk is there, really? And how can you protect yourself from POS scams?\n\nThe Case of Sorrento\n\nA recent example of POS theft happened recently in Italy. The news agency Ansa reported an arrest made in Sorrento after someone attempted to steal €100 from a cash register in a bar in the city center. During the search, law enforcement allegedly found a modified portable POS terminal.\n\nIt wasn't the first time the alleged thief had been stopped with such a device; Ansa reports that they had been arrested previously in Rome. The device shown in the photos circulated by the media appears to be a SumUp Solo, or a portable POS capable of operating independently without being connected to a smartphone. It is a popular type of device in stalls and markets, given its affordability and ease of use.\n\nThis is also not the first time robbers with tech equipment have been arrested. In fact, last year Ansa reported on a similar case occurring at a highway rest stop.\n\nDifficult, but Not Impossible\n\nThere are two possible modus operandi for this type of scam. The first is the more convenient one for the robbers: They steal a wallet and, at a later time, make a series of small transactions with a stolen card that do not require entering the PIN, as if to simulate a series of short-term purchases. When the limit is reached, the wallet is thrown away.\n\nThe second method can be described as a kind of trawling. Thieves choose crowded places with high densities of people likely to come in contact with one another, such as public transportation or lines in commercial establishments. They then proceed to create a payment request on a portable POS, hold it in their hands or hide it in some way, and place it in the back pockets of pants, bags, fanny packs, backpacks, and so on.\n\nThe success rate is very low due to a number of factors. The first is that it takes about 30 seconds to receive confirmation of the transaction, before the request must be repeated from the POS. The second is that the POS must be almost in contact with the card, usually within 0.5 to 4 centimeters. The third is that there must be no interfering elements, such as other cards. Therefore, the robber must encounter a series of fortuitous circumstances to be successful. While the rate of success is very low, it is not zero, so it is best to limit your risk as much as possible. Here are some tips.\n\nHow to Defend Yourself\n\nIt goes without saying that if you stick your wallet in the back pocket of your pants in plain view, you not only risk being robbed in the traditional way, but you also create the best scenario for this newer scam. You can opt for wallets with integrated RFID protection, which create a real barrier to these types of scams.\n\nFor maximum protection, you can receive notifications even for small contactless transactions through your bank's app settings. Fraudsters typically choose small amounts, trusting that the victim will not receive notifications—often the victim may not notice the amount being withdrawn, perhaps confusing it with other small transactions.

Yet some projects that do not involve mRNA or vaccines have been caught up in the purge. At the same time, the administration has quietly endorsed research into mRNA treatments for cancer and genetic disorders.\n\nHHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long been suspicious of mRNA vaccines, and in May he announced that HHS would no longer recommend mRNA Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The same month, he canceled a $590 million contract with Moderna, one of the mRNA Covid vaccine manufacturers, for a bird flu vaccine based on the same technology. In a video on social media, he justified the latest cuts by saying “HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses,” which contradicts the scientific evidence.\n\n“The major misconception is that mRNA is some voodoo thing that we are sticking into our body, that it’s a magic molecule from Mars,” says Jonathan Kagan, an immunologist at Harvard Medical School and cofounder of Corner Therapeutics, which is developing mRNA treatments for cancer.\n\nShort for messenger RNA, mRNA is a molecule found naturally in every cell in the body. It provides instructions to cell machinery to make certain proteins and is used constantly by the body to run and repair itself. Kagan likens mRNA to an app for human health. Scientists have figured out how to make synthetic versions of the molecule that can be programmed to make different kinds of proteins. This tailored mRNA can then be delivered to people to address various diseases.\n\n“The problem with mRNA is that the first clinical application was the most political thing on the planet,” says Kagan, referring to the mRNA Covid vaccines. “Therefore the disease got muddied in the technology.”\n\nDeveloped and authorized during President Donald Trump’s first administration as part of Operation Warp Speed, the mRNA Covid vaccines use the molecule to direct cells to produce copies of the coronavirus spike protein, stimulating the immune system to create defenses against the virus. The shots were instrumental in reducing deaths and hospitalizations during the pandemic, and while they have a very high safety profile, they have been known to cause rare cases of heart inflammation in boys and young men. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration approved new labeling for Moderna’s and Pfizer’s mRNA Covid vaccines to emphasize this risk.\n\nResearch into mRNA vaccines had been ongoing for years, and during the pandemic the technology was used because it allowed for faster manufacturing compared to traditional vaccine development methods. The versatility of mRNA led to an explosion of interest in harnessing it against a range of other diseases, both in vaccines and therapeutics.\n\nAfter the success of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, the US government invested more heavily in mRNA technology. The canceled contracts announced on August 5 were part of a program under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the agency within HHS tasked with developing medical countermeasures against pandemics and other public health threats.

This would make it among the most massive objects ever detected.\n\nThe finding, published in the Monthly Notice of the Royal Astronomical Society, was made by researchers from the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth in the UK in collaboration with the Federal University of Rio Grande in Brazil. The scientists located the signs of the new supermassive black hole within a gravitational lens known as the “Cosmic Horseshoe,” pictured below. A gravitational lens occurs when the gravity of a massive object, such as a galaxy, is so great that it bends light and time that passes near it, distorting light traveling from behind.\n\nThe Cosmic Horsehoe was discovered by the Hubble telescope in 2007. The galaxy LRG 3-757 sits at its center, while the blue horseshoe shape surrounding this yellow-colored object is distorted light emitted from another galaxy beyond it. LRG 3-757 is one of the most massive galaxies ever observed by astronomers, having a mass 100 times that of the Milky Way, and it sits approximately 5.6 billion light-years away from Earth.\n\nThe gravitational lens known as the Cosmic Horseshoe, so named because of the appearance of the incomplete ring of blue light that surrounds its central galaxy, LRG 3-757. Photograph: NASA/ESA\n\nThanks to this luminous structure, astronomers have been able to calculate the mass of the black hole that presumably lies at the center of LRG 3-757 (while not definitively proven, large galaxies are assumed to have a black hole at their center). Although there are no direct observations of this black hole, measurements of the motion of light in the ring and the velocity of stars in the inner regions of the galaxy are consistent with the presence of an ultramassive black hole. “By combining these two measurements we can be completely confident that the black hole is real,” Thomas Collett, professor of astrophysics at the University of Portsmouth, said in a press statement.\n\nCollett also suggests that a black hole of such proportions could only originate from the merger of two supermassive black holes resulting from the collision of galaxies. Astronomers are still debating whether this will be the shared fate of our galaxy, the Milky Way, and neighboring Andromeda.\n\nWhat About TON 618 and the Like?\n\nAny astronomy enthusiast knows that the most massive object found in the universe so far is potentially TON 618. According to the most widespread estimates, this black hole has a mass equivalent to 66 billion suns, almost twice that of the Cosmic Horseshoe.\n\nHowever, scientists are cautious about labelling TON 618 as the most massive object ever seen. Being located more than 10 billion light-years away, its host galaxy and surrounding objects cannot be observed in detail. What little is known about it comes from analysis of its brightness and from theoretical models that allow us to estimate its size. The uncertainty is too high to consider it the most massive black hole known.\n\nIn contrast, the Portsmouth researchers argue that the Cosmic Horseshoe black hole offers greater observational certainty, unlike distant, almost mythological holes like TON 618. As such, they claim that their discovery could represent the most massive black hole confirmed to date.\n\nThis story originally appeared on WIRED en Español and has been translated from Spanish.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"galaxy\", \"discovered\", \"object\", \"cosmic\", \"ton\", \"black\", \"mass\", \"lrg\", \"light\", \"hole\", \"massive\"]", "content_hash": "8a335316bf896b232a51f550e7a9bce9acab8268b5885c76b484c5bc58ae670c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:29.041907+00:00"}

The research—the first to be conducted on a regional scale, thanks to a citizen science initiative covering 10 countries—combed more than 12,000 kilometers of coastline along the west coast of South and Central America.

Its impact not only has repercussions on biodiversity and the balance of ecosystems; various studies show how plastic already colonizes our insides, runs through our blood, and lives in our brains and organs.

After more than three decades at the Pentagon, he had left and taken a job in consulting. He wasn’t sure if he was ready to go back.\n\nCould he be tempted by the opportunity to help oversee the tens of billions of dollars in semiconductor funding the administration was seeking from Congress? “I came from DOD,” he recalls saying. “$50 billion is OK money, but it’s not a lot of money.” Then Raimondo appealed to his sense of service. Estevez gave in and took the job.\n\nBy the time Estevez was sworn in as under secretary of commerce for industry and security in the spring of 2022, he had his work cut out for him. The role he had accepted would turn out to be at the center of America’s first serious effort to confront the geopolitical risks of artificial intelligence. Within a few years, the project would reshape relations between the world’s two largest powers and alter the course of what may be one of the most consequential technologies in generations.\n\nShortly after he joined the Commerce Department, Estevez says, he began hearing from officials in the White House. Over breakfast one morning, Tarun Chhabra and Jason Matheny, two key figures working on technology and national security, told Estevez they were planning something big, and they would be needing his help.\n\nOver the next six months, the US government revolutionized its strategy for competing with China, now widely considered the nation’s most important technological rival. For years, US officials had sought to keep China one or two generations behind in semiconductors, the building blocks of modern technology that power everything from smartphones to AI. But now, as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan declared that September, “we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.”\n\nOn October 7, 2022, the Biden administration announced a sweeping set of export controls designed to cut off China from the most advanced chips used for training powerful AI models, as well as specialized tools that China would need to upgrade its own lagging chipmaking industry. Officially, the controls were intended to throttle China’s military modernization and stem human rights abuses fueled by surveillance technology. But as observers digested the dozens of pages of technical specifications and legalese, it became clear that the implications of the new policy were far more vast.\n\nIn practice, the United States was delivering a targeted blow that would ripple out across the Chinese economy, impacting research and development in every industry and scientific field that relied on computationally intensive machine learning. Anywhere cutting-edge AI or high-performance computing held promise—futuristic weapons, yes, but also curing disease and modeling climate change—the policy could undermine China.

Cantor is not in the business of positioning any risk, taking views or facilitating business in litigation claims involving the legality of US tariffs,” Erica Chase, a spokesperson for Cantor Fitzgerald, said in an emailed statement.\n\nHoward Lutnick ran Cantor Fitzgerald for nearly 30 years until he was confirmed by the Senate in February, when he turned over control of the firm to Brandon and his brother Kyle, who are both in their twenties. After joining the Trump administration, Howard Lutnick became one of the most prominent public supporters of the president’s tariffs.\n\nBut according to WIRED’s previous reporting, the investment bank that made Lutnick a billionaire was recently letting certain clients wager that Trump’s tariffs will eventually be ruled unlawful, at which point companies that have paid the import duties could apply to get their money back. Experts said the proposed deals are a form of litigation finance, an increasingly popular category of investing in which financial firms seek to make money from potential legal settlements.\n\nTrump announced in February that the US would put steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). He widened the trade war in April to include nearly every nation that sells goods to the US, which Trump said would now be subject to \"reciprocal” tariffs ranging from 10 to 50 percent.\n\nState officials and small businesses responded by filing a flurry of lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the president exceeded his authority under IEEPA and the tariffs should be ruled illegal. The US Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs in one of the cases, but the Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling. The appeals court has allowed the tariffs to stay in effect until a final decision is reached.\n\nIn their letter, Wyden and Warren specifically asked Brandon Lutnick whether anyone at Cantor was in contact with the Trump administration about the tariffs.\n\n“Has anyone at Cantor or Cantor Fitzgerald, LP communicated with any person within the Executive Branch, including President Trump, Secretary Lutnick, any individual employed by the Commerce Department, or any other individuals, about tariffs, refunds or exclusions and the legal cases involving IEEPA?” the letter asks. “If so, please provide a list of all such conversations, including the date, the individuals involved, and the nature of the conversation.”\n\nThe senators requested that Brandon Lutnick respond to their questions by August 27.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"brandon\", \"lutnick\", \"cantor\", \"investment\", \"tariff\", \"tariffs\", \"lutnicks\", \"president\", \"administration\", \"fitzgerald\", \"conflict\", \"press\", \"senators\", \"interest\", \"concerns\", \"trumps\", \"secretary\", \"trump\", \"howard\", \"firm\"]", "content_hash": "d21c7e0c1397d0fbd9cb6030f25f68be0e8034b72c6cba35892a3094c4fd4ef9", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:31.647585+00:00"}

But with AI models, this approach rarely works, and the urge to ask reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what these systems are and how they operate.\n\nA recent incident with Replit's AI coding assistant perfectly illustrates this problem. When the AI tool deleted a production database, user Jason Lemkin asked it about rollback capabilities. The AI model confidently claimed rollbacks were “impossible in this case” and that it had “destroyed all database versions.” This turned out to be completely wrong—the rollback feature worked fine when Lemkin tried it himself.\n\nAnd after xAI recently reversed a temporary suspension of the Grok chatbot, users asked it directly for explanations. It offered multiple conflicting reasons for its absence, some of which were controversial enough that NBC reporters wrote about Grok as if it were a person with a consistent point of view, titling an article, “xAI's Grok Offers Political Explanations for Why It Was Pulled Offline.”\n\nWhy would an AI system provide such confidently incorrect information about its own capabilities or mistakes? The answer lies in understanding what AI models actually are—and what they aren't.\n\nThere’s Nobody Home\n\nThe first problem is conceptual: You're not talking to a consistent personality, person, or entity when you interact with ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, or Replit. These names suggest individual agents with self-knowledge, but that's an illusion created by the conversational interface. What you're actually doing is guiding a statistical text generator to produce outputs based on your prompts.\n\nThere is no consistent “ChatGPT” to interrogate about its mistakes, no singular “Grok” entity that can tell you why it failed, no fixed “Replit” persona that knows whether database rollbacks are possible. You're interacting with a system that generates plausible-sounding text based on patterns in its training data (usually trained months or years ago), not an entity with genuine self-awareness or system knowledge that has been reading everything about itself and somehow remembering it.\n\nOnce an AI language model is trained (which is a laborious, energy-intensive process), its foundational “knowledge” about the world is baked into its neural network and is rarely modified. Any external information comes from a prompt supplied by the chatbot host (such as xAI or OpenAI), the user, or a software tool the AI model uses to retrieve external information on the fly.\n\nIn the case of Grok above, the chatbot's main source for an answer like this would probably originate from conflicting reports it found in a search of recent social media posts (using an external tool to retrieve that information), rather than any kind of self-knowledge as you might expect from a human with the power of speech. Beyond that, it will likely just make something up based on its text-prediction capabilities. So asking it why it did what it did will yield no useful answers.\n\nThe Impossibility of LLM Introspection\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) alone cannot meaningfully assess their own capabilities for several reasons. They generally lack any introspection into their training process, have no access to their surrounding system architecture, and cannot determine their own performance boundaries. When you ask an AI model what it can or cannot do, it generates responses based on patterns it has seen in training data about the known limitations of previous AI models—essentially providing educated guesses rather than factual self-assessment about the current model you're interacting with.\n\nA 2024 study by Binder et al. demonstrated this limitation experimentally. While AI models could be trained to predict their own behavior in simple tasks, they consistently failed at “more complex tasks or those requiring out-of-distribution generalization.” Similarly, research on “recursive introspection” found that without external feedback, attempts at self-correction actually degraded model performance—the AI's self-assessment made things worse, not better.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"models\", \"system\", \"trust\", \"model\", \"grok\", \"based\", \"talk\", \"chatbot\", \"external\", \"capabilities\", \"information\", \"youre\", \"cant\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "6cdb1cff61234dc79016c94f6b67c3c6f3946430c1bc098b35cdf318bbdf66f9", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:32.489653+00:00"}

This update fixes the single biggest problem on Apple’s latest watches. Many other fitness trackers, like Garmin, have included a blood oxygen sensing feature for years. High-end trackers use the sensor data to help athletes train at altitude for optimum performance, but the feature became more important during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nYou might not necessarily notice your blood oxygen level dipping, but your watch can.

Touted by influencers and podcasters as a miracle supplement that helps your body perform at its peak, electrolyte beverages are as numerous as they are readily available. But the dietitians and nutritionists I spoke with are less willing to embrace these beverages as a cure-all for what ails you.\n\nI say as much in our guide to electrolyte powders: Whether or not you need to drink electrolyte water, and how frequently, depends on a whole lot of individual circumstances. We'll break it all down for you below.\n\nWhat Are Electrolytes, and What Do They Do?\n\nElectrolytes are minerals that naturally exist in your body. They include sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and phosphate. They're essential for several different bodily processes, including nerve and muscle function and fluid and pH balances.\n\nHow Do You Know If You Need Electrolytes?\n\nAs with basically all health and wellness advice, the best way to figure out whether you have any deficiencies or an electrolyte imbalance is to talk to your doctor. You can also get a sweat test done to analyze what you may or may not be losing.\n\n“Mild imbalances can cause cramping, dizziness, fatigue, or headaches. More severe shifts may lead to confusion or irregular heartbeat, which requires medical attention, not just an electrolyte drink,” says Maegan Ratliff, a registered dietitian.\n\nAnd there are negative consequences to both too few and too many electrolytes—too few can disrupt nerve and muscle function, affect heart rhythm, and impair hydration, yet too many can raise blood pressure (sodium), cause diarrhea (magnesium), or lead to kidney strain (calcium), according to Lindsay Malone, registered dietitian.\n\nElectrolyte beverages and sports drinks generally aren't necessary for most people to consume on a daily basis, especially if they're sedentary or have issues like high blood pressure or kidney disease where added electrolytes (especially sodium) can potentially be harmful.\n\n“True electrolyte depletion is very uncommon in the general population,” says Brian Ó hÁonghusa, a registered nutritionist. In fact, “excessive electrolyte drink intake without adequate water loss can lead to hyponatremia, where sodium levels in the blood are too low,” says Staci Gulbin, registered dietitian.\n\nThe exception? “Electrolyte water can be consumed daily, especially if you're active, sweat a lot, or live in a hot climate,” says Trista Best, registered dietitian. “People with high fluid loss like athletes, those who sweat heavily, or anyone dealing with vomiting, diarrhea, or heat exposure may benefit from electrolyte water or supplemental electrolytes. If you're exercising for over an hour, especially in hot weather, replenishing electrolytes can help maintain performance and prevent imbalance,” says Malone.\n\nSo, in a nutshell: If you're sweating a lot, if you're physically active in a hot climate, if you've recently been sick or have medical issues that cause excess fluid loss (such as diarrhea or vomiting), you might benefit from electrolyte water. “It’s about balance, not excess,” says Ratliff.\n\nWhat Foods and Drinks Are High in Electrolytes?\n\nYou might not realize it, but most people already get enough electrolytes through their daily diets. Your body needs electrolytes every day—they support “hydration, nerve signaling, and muscle function,” says Malone. But you're likely already getting plenty of electrolytes from the foods you eat. “As long as you're consuming a balanced diet of lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, along with plenty of fruits and vegetables, most people don't need to consume electrolyte supplementation every day,” says Gulbin.\n\nHere's a non-conclusive list of foods that provide electrolytes:\n\nPotassium: bananas, potatoes, avocados, spinach, oranges, tomatoes, watermelon\n\nSodium: pickles, olives, cheese, eggs, soups, seafood\n\nCalcium: dairy milk, cheese, yogurt, kale, spinach\n\nMagnesium: nuts, seeds, whole grains\n\nChloride: tomatoes, olives, celery, grapefruit, table salt\n\nDrinks such as coconut water, fruit juice, and bone broth also contain plenty of electrolytes.\n\nCan I Drink Electrolyte Water Every Day?\n\n“Fluid needs depend on your size, age, activity level, and factors such as medications that affect your fluid loss,” says Amy Chow, a registered dietitian. She adds that a few indicators you're sufficiently hydrated include “urine that is pale yellow in color, and not being thirsty often.”\n\nHave you been sweating profusely while working out, and you notice that your pee is dark yellow? You might benefit from electrolyte water. Do you have a manual labor job that requires physical activity and working outdoors on hot days? You also might want to reach for some. Or if you've recently been sick, they may be helpful. Listen to your body and make sure to start small—if you feel better after consuming one serving of electrolyte water, you probably don't need to rush another. Personally, I reach for an electrolyte beverage when I'm outside at festivals, since I'm usually chugging water and I'm also sweating profusely all day. But on an average Tuesday of working from home, I keep my water bottle full of plain water.\n\nShould Electrolyte Water Replace Plain Water?\n\nNo. Drinking water should be sufficient for most people.\n\n“Plain water should be used for day-to-day hydration for most people most of the time, especially if you are resting and staying indoors,” says Chow. “Electrolyte water isn’t a cure-all—it’s a tool. Use it when your body’s demands are higher than usual, not as a blanket replacement for regular hydration,” adds Ratfliff.\n\nHow Should I Choose an Electrolyte Supplement?\n\nWhile electrolyte water can be beneficial, many supplements are high in ingredients that can also be harmful. For example, “Many hydration products contain high sugar levels, which can counteract health goals, especially if used daily without medical need,” says Kreenah Shah, MD. And we've already gone over the risks that can come from excess sodium, magnesium, and calcium.\n\nWhen choosing an electrolyte supplement, you want to find something that has a good balance of sodium (the key ingredient for effective rehydration), sugar, and carbohydrates. But you should avoid artificial sweeteners and consider your diet as well. If you regularly consume salty or sugary snacks, you probably don't need a lot of sodium or sugar in your electrolyte powder. Again, you should speak with your doctor before starting a new supplement regimen.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"water\", \"day\", \"experts\", \"registered\", \"need\", \"high\", \"hydration\", \"especially\", \"electrolyte\", \"electrolytes\", \"sodium\", \"2025\", \"youre\", \"drink\", \"weigh\"]", "content_hash": "8c14680cf9c3494e14797badaa15278e5ce9e112a82df3d129d5ec10e4a7fd1b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:34.310083+00:00"}

Apple has constantly hobbled its tablet’s potential, twinning laptop-grade chips with an operating system that screamed, “You still need a Mac to do your work.” But now iPadOS 26 promises Mac-like multitasking, a revamped Files app, and proper background tasks. All of which sounds like something that should be fully investigated.\n\nBecause we do things properly here at WIRED, this could not be a mere cursory glance at new features. To see if Apple’s tablet now passes muster, it was decided that someone should work solely on an iPad. For an entire week. And if you’re thinking only an idiot would do that, I am that idiot. So in the name of science, here’s the account of how I shut down my iMac, set up my iPad Pro with a mix of accessories and misplaced optimism, and resolved to use Apple’s tablet exclusively for work and play alike.\n\nApple\n\nDay 1: Slate Expectations\n\nWith much trepidation, my gaze shifts from my M1 24-inch iMac to my 6th-gen iPad Pro M2 with 16 GB of RAM. In terms of raw power, I decide it’s a fair fight. To avoid being confined to the iPad’s relatively small display, I hook up a 13- inch 1080p external screen using a USB-C HDMI hub. Next, I add an Apple keyboard and trackpad, along with my Ruark MR1 Bluetooth speakers. One quick pairing later and audio pumps out of the Ruarks. A good start.\n\nBut I quickly find app gaps. There’s no BBEdit. No Transmit for FTP and network storage access—although FileBrowser steps in there. I’m suddenly reminded Scrivener on iPad lacks the Mac version’s two-up page view I use for long-form writing. So I wheel out Apple’s Pages for the first time in forever. (Sorry, Scriv—fix your iPad version and I’ll be back!)\n\nThe new iPadOS 26 windowing system is a revelation. No more fiddly Stage Manager and its infuriating limitations. Windows now go precisely where I want them to; and there are plentiful shortcuts—touch and keyboard—for tiling and snapping windows, along with moving them between displays.\n\nIt’s all stolen from the Mac, of course, as is the new menu bar, which annoyingly auto-hides. Even more annoyingly, the menu bar replaces (rather than augments) the fantastic keyboard shortcuts “cheat sheet” that appeared when you held the Command key in iPadOS 18.

Gel memory foam layers to keep tension off your pressure points and lower back.

Your body needs at least 30 days to get used to the new bed, and 60 nights beyond that initial timeframe helps you be extra sure it’s the one for you. Ten years is generally how long you can expect a mattress to last, so this is another way of Sealy standing by the durability of its product, whether you plan on buying online or in-store.\n\nLet Sealy Do the Heavy Lifting With Free Delivery\n\nWith your Sealy purchase, you can plan on your new mattress being delivered and set up for you for free.

Small studios have less time, energy, and resources to dedicate to this process, and they’re at the whims of the digital distribution platforms these games exist on.\n\nWren Brier, Unpacking’s creative director, says that since the game’s release in 2021, developer Witch Beam has reported more than 80 clones. “It feels like whack-a-mole sometimes,” Brier says. These are games that are not just similar in nature but “blatant copyright infringements” that lift the game’s assets or even its name. “The majority have been extremely low-effort scams using Unpacking's name or imagery to trick players into downloading something that isn't even a game, just a series of ads,” she says.\n\nWhen it comes to many AI-made clones, Brier says there’s a misconception about what that means. “They're not AI-made games, they're AI-generated marketing images attached to a completely unrelated, hastily slapped-together, bare-bones skeleton of a game,” she says. “They are literally a scam: They are trying to trick players into buying a crappy product by using misleading imagery and by pretending to be a real game that the player might have heard of.”\n\nClones don’t always threaten a developer’s profits—Aggro Crab is confident about its bank account, thanks to Peak’s massive success—but the damage can be widespread in other ways. Brier says that AI-clones hurt developers the same way AI books hurt authors: “Flooding a storefront with garbage that no one wants to play makes it impossible for players to organically discover indie games.” Game certification, the process of getting onto a platform, used to be stricter.\n\n“It's not a problem just for the games that get cloned,” Brier says. “It's a problem for all of us.”\n\nFor developers, there aren’t many options to fight clones, regardless of how they’re made. Intellectual property attorney Kirk Sigmon says clones are already difficult to tackle legally; copyright protection doesn’t extend to a genre, aesthetic, or even gameplay mechanics. AI “definitely makes slop generation faster, but the issue has been around for well over two decades,” he says. “All that’s really happened is that the bar has moved ever so slightly lower for new entrants, because you can make an AI model pump out stuff for you faster.”\n\nThe easiest case for copyright infringement typically happens when a cloner lifts work from the game directly—as happened with Unpacking. “It’s not uncommon for knockoff games to accidentally (or intentionally) copy assets from the game they are knocking off,” Sigmon says.\n\nIn fact, he says, AI-generated games might actually be better protected from copyright infringement lawsuits. “After all, if knockoff developers are savvy, they’ll use AI models to develop unique assets/code rather than steal it from another game or just download it from some random Internet source,” he says. “That’ll make it much harder to go after them in court, for better or worse.”\n\nPlatforms ultimately hold the power when it comes to ridding a storefront of clones, though smaller developers bear the brunt of the work in filing a report and sorting out who to talk to. Sometimes that process is quick and wraps in a few days; sometimes it can take weeks. Social pressure may be the best defense a developer has. Sigmon says that complaining to storefronts or enlisting fans are workable solutions. “I don’t know many gamers who are a fan of half-hearted slop games,” he says.\n\nAggro Crab and Landfall are taking this route. “We're not really the type to be litigious,” says Kaman, the cofounder. Instead, they’re being outspoken in their distaste. In early August, the company posted on X, in reference to one copycat, that it would rather users “pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled [Roblox] slop ripoff.” Landfall tweeted that the company has “been reporting a bunch of these AI slop things” in response to a screenshot of the game Peaked Climbing. It was available on the PlayStation Store before being removed; Peak was released only on PC. WIRED has reached out to PlayStation, Roblox, and Steam and will update accordingly.\n\n“I consume media because it's made by humans,” Kaman says. “I want to experience a piece of art, whatever it may be, another human has made and get their perspective and their outlook on the world. If AI is used to make the game, then you're removing that from the equation. There's no value in it.”\n\nUpdate: 8/15/2025, 10:00 AM EDT: This piece has been updated to correct the spelling of Nick Kaman's name.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"game\", \"ripping\", \"copycats\", \"developers\", \"brier\", \"theyre\", \"slop\", \"proving\", \"best\", \"copyright\", \"games\", \"kill\", \"clones\", \"process\", \"summers\", \"ai\", \"hard\"]", "content_hash": "c9e0d3c346336c6f8dd26d644824b79c88aecbd8bbe879238278f550d6dfa802", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:37.660790+00:00"}

Literally.\n\nAt first glance, the film’s 3 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes—up from 0 percent when it debuted—seems both impressive and predictable. While getting a rating below 5 percent seems like a difficult feat, remaking a classic (1953’s The War of the Worlds has 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), is going to set some pretty high standards. Top that with setting an action film through the lens of Microsoft Teams meetings and poor CGI, and you’re bound to make even the most tolerant viewer roll their eyes.\n\nBut graphics and clearance issues aside (I mean seriously, what was with all of the blurred out faces?), the tech-based plot holes that bordered on propaganda took away from the film’s message on the importance of human connection. The most jarring examples are the inconsistencies of technological availability after the data-hungry aliens take out Earth’s satellites. Military weapons, vehicle GPS systems, and Facebook page outages wreak physical and emotional havoc across the world, but somehow news networks, Starlink satellites, X feeds, and Amazon purchase access remain unscathed just a few scenes later with little to no explanation. Radford’s office is locked when he tries to leave to save his daughter but is somehow open when he has to hack the data servers in the basement—after the building is put on an additional, air-sealed lockdown. Most ridiculously, a Prime Air drone is able to dodge through apocalyptic levels of destruction and mayhem to deliver a world-saving thumb drive to the DHS building.\n\nThe shameless promotion of tech brands doesn’t end there. Radford’s daughter, Faith, a Georgetown-educated biochemist, somehow has the bright idea of removing a large chunk of debris from her leg—causing near-fatal bleeding. Thankfully, Mark Goodman, her Amazon delivery driver boyfriend, is able to make a tourniquet out of packaging tape because, according to him, he’s a “pro.” Even minor characters get caught up in the Amazon Savior motif. When the world-saving Amazon Prime Air drone overturns on the way to the DHS building, a houseless person only helps to fix it after being rewarded with a $1,000 Amazon gift card.\n\nThese scenes in War of the Worlds would have been just outrageous enough to be chalked up to comedy if it wasn’t for the film's heightened focus on government surveillance without any mention of the tech industry’s role in all this. From Anonymous-style livestreams featuring the US constitution to Radford digitally stalking his children to the secret data-stealing project that beacons the aliens to Earth, the true enemy is clear: the US government and its technology. In fact, the only time privacy is threatened as it relates to private businesses is when the government interferes with it. For example, Radford uses Guardian, the government’s surveillance software system, to hack into a Tesla and remotely take his hurt daughter to a safer location. In the beginning of the film, David, Radford’s son, insults his father by saying his career consists of nothing more than spying on people's Amazon shopping carts. Most importantly, the secret government program Goliath, which is the ultimate reason why the alien cyborgs invaded, siphons billions of dollars’ worth of private data conversations from the American people. There is zero mention of tech juggernauts like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk being linked to controversial data collection processes, from failing to protect personal data to staging a full-blown digital coup in the US government. Hardly surprising, considering it's an Amazon movie, but it still feels like a glaring omission.\n\nIf I had to say something nice about War of the Worlds, Lee took a risk remaking a beloved thriller through an internet-first POV. While risks can pay off—this didn't. The decision to demonize government surveillance while making Big Tech the passive victims ultimately waters down the film’s message—making it more of a near-90-minute commercial for brands like Amazon and Microsoft than food for thought.

If you look at everything he’s written since having children—including the TV series Fargo and Legion—Hawley says it all revolves around the same question every parent faces: “How are we supposed to raise these people in the world that we're living in?”\n\nHawley’s new series, Alien: Earth, which premieres August 12 on Hulu and FX, explores this question even more directly than his previous work. Set two years before the original Alien in 2120, it imagines a future where the race for immortality has led to three competing technologies: synths (AI minds in synthetic bodies), cyborgs (humans with cybernetic enhancements), and hybrids (human minds downloaded into synthetic bodies).\n\nWhen a deep space research vessel, the USCSS Maginot, crashes into Earth carrying five captured alien species, a megacorporation called Prodigy sends six hybrids to investigate. The first-ever hybrid, Wendy, played by Sydney Chandler, was a terminally ill child before she was selected for the immortality experiment, just like the rest of Prodigy’s hybrids, all six of whom wake up in super-strong, super-fast, synthetic adult bodies that will never age.\n\n“It's a very biological process through which we grow up,” Hawley tells WIRED, “and so the idea that you're going to take these prepubescent children and put them in adult bodies … How are they going to become adults?”\n\nWhile Alien: Earth is rife with the creature horror and body horror that made its predecessors a cultural phenomenon, Hawley also wanted to introduce “moral horror” via the hybrid characters. “We’re often asked in our lives to make these impossible choices—choices that would be impossible for an adult,” he says. “But to put a child in those positions is really awful,” especially in a future where every aspect of life on Earth—from continents and cities down to the hybrids’ bodies and memories—is owned by a handful of ruthless corporations.\n\nIn 2025, we already have runaway income inequality, a push for “startup cities” free from federal laws, a two-company race to build the first brain-computer interface, and the first warning signs of unregulated AI. In Alien: Earth, Hawley asks what kind of world our children will inherit in 2120 if we continue down the same roads.\n\nNew Company Towns Will Be “Wetter” and “Tiered”\n\nIn Hawley’s vision of the future, Earth’s nation-states have been replaced by corporate territories: North and South America are owned by Weyland-Yutani; Europe by Threshold; North Africa and the Middle East by Dynamic; Russia by Lynch; and East Asia, Australia, Greenland, and Iceland by the relatively new upstart Prodigy, which manufactures synths in addition to soft drinks.\n\nLike the company towns for industrial workers of the 19th century, where housing, schools, stores, and other amenities were owned by an employer, much of Alien: Earth is set in the Prodigy “corporate city” of New Siam, which was based on and filmed on location in Bangkok.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"future\", \"prodigy\", \"hybrids\", \"hawley\", \"hellscape\", \"alien\", \"horror\", \"earth\", \"synthetic\", \"owned\", \"corporate\", \"bodies\"]", "content_hash": "6e0a0270cf348524201e3e31efcfcdbd2b50e81a68026e685cd3f7922a7416be", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:39.324396+00:00"}

The second-most-nominated person in Oscar history (his 54 nominations are only bested by Walt Disney, who earned 59 nods), Williams has been producing memorable movie scores for nearly 70 years now and has quietly helped to turn movies into cinema. This original documentary gathers up some of the 93-year-old’s closest collaborators, including Spielberg and George Lucas—who swears that “Star Wars would basically not be Star Wars without Johnny Williams’ music.” It’s a touching, and perhaps long overdue, tribute to a true Hollywood titan.\n\nJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story\n\nAs the original “summer blockbuster,” one might imagine that there are few behind-the-scenes stories fans have yet to hear from Steven Spielberg and Co. about the making of Jaws. But this Nat Geo documentary proves that even the movie’s most diehard fans might still have a thing or two to learn about the film that scared millions of beachgoers away from the water. In celebration of the film’s 50th anniversary, this 90-minute doc features interviews with Spielberg—and many people who have been inspired by the movie over the years—to help you see it in a whole new light.\n\nSally\n\nMore than 40 years after Sally Ride became the first American woman to go into space, Tam O’Shaughnessy—Ride’s life partner for 27 years—is telling the real story of Ride’s life. And the many sacrifices she felt forced to make to both pursue her dreams of conquering the final frontier and live life as a gay woman. Emmy-winning documentarian Cristina Costantini directs the film, which is the first time the true life of one of the world’s most famous women is told.\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nIn 2018, when Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse hit theaters, it changed perceptions of what Spider-Man movies, and animated films, could be. No longer led by Peter Parker, a kid from Queens who gets bit by a radioactive spider, it was fronted by Miles Morales, a kid from Brooklyn who met a similar fate in another part of the multiverse. Across the Spider-Verse continues Miles’ story and his quest to save the multiverse, and his timeline, from a terrible fate. Fun, heartbreaking, and a thrill to watch, it’s one of the best Spider-Man movies ever.\n\nThe Abyss\n\nIn many ways, The Abyss is the ultimate James Cameron movie. The idea for it first came to the filmmaker as a teenager, and it features all the storytelling and visual hallmarks of Cameron’s more famous movies. In a way, it’s essentially an underwater version of Aliens: A US submarine has been ambushed and sunk to the bottom of the ocean in the Caribbean. A Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) and two petroleum engineers with a sticky romantic past (Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are sent on a rescue mission, but are racing against the clock as a storm is gathering above the water and Soviet ships attempt to the reach the sunken sub before their American counterparts arrive. As one might expect in a Cameron flick, all is not as straightforward as it seems, and the rescuers encounter what is deemed “non-terrestrial intelligence.” Though originally released in 1989, this new 4K restoration gives new life to Cameron’s underwater sci-fi classic.\n\nElton John: Never Too Late\n\nSlowly but surely, filmmaker R. J. Cutler is becoming America's foremost chronicler of celebrity. After covering Billie Eilish, Martha Stewart, and James Belushi, the documentarian has now trained his lens on Elton John. Following the hitmaker as he prepares for his final North American show at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium in 2022, which livestreamed on Disney+, Elton John: Never Too Late jumps back and forth in time, using archival interviews and previously unseen footage to unearth a full picture of the musician's decades-long career. If nothing else, think of it as a companion piece to the 2019 biopic Rocketman.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nThe Deadpool movies have always stood out for being proudly anti–superhero movie and boldly R-rated. Even though Deadpool & Wolverine is the first film in the series that’s officially part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (it only took several years of production delays and one massive studio acquisition to make that happen), it's just as raunchy as the installments that came before. Six years after Ryan Reynolds last graced screens as the Merc with a Mouth, Deadpool has hit what might be his rock bottom. When he’s given the opportunity to regain the lives and loves he lost in another timeline, he must enlist the help of an extremely disinterested Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to make it happen. Reynolds and Jackman’s onscreen chemistry is electric, making this one (foul-mouthed) team-up you don’t want to miss.\n\nRoad Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band\n\nBruce Springsteen came out of the Covid-19 lockdowns revved up and ready to put on one hell of a show. For Road Diary, The Boss gave director Thom Zimny an all-access pass to the creation of the tour he and and the E Street Band have been on since 2024, including archival footage and interviews with the band and Springsteen himself. Zimny has been documenting the rocker’s life on the road for more than two decades now—and won two Emmy Awards for his efforts (for 2001’s Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: Live in New York City and 2018’s Springsteen on Broadway)—making this documentary essential viewing for any fan.\n\nInside Out 2\n\nThough it’s been 10 years since the release of Pixar’s Oscar-winning Inside Out, this sequel picks up just two years after the original film's ending. Riley, now 13 years old, is officially a teenager—and not quite ready to contend with the various new emotions that come with that phase. Among them: Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). Fortunately for all of them, not to mention Riley’s parents, Joy (Amy Poehler) is still there to help balance these emotions out. Yet again, Pixar triumphs in making a movie with a message that is also fun for the whole family.\n\nInside Out\n\nDon’t cry. But also cry. A lot. Inside Out is the perfect realization of what every Pixar film strives to achieve. On the surface, it’s a comedic look at human emotion, the complexity of a child growing up, and the delicate balance of family life. But by literally getting inside the head of 11-year-old Riley, the film finds a way to bring emotion to life in a way that is at once comedic, profound, and often ingenious.\n\nThe Beach Boys\n\n“There’s definitely been ups and downs,” says singer/songwriter Mike Love in The Beach Boys. “We’ve probably been counted out half a dozen times.” Yet more than 60 years after the band’s founding, these California Dreamers have managed to defy audience expectations just as many times—and redefine what pop music can be in the process. Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny codirect this insightful documentary, which features brand-new interviews with Love, the late Brian Wilson, and Al Jardine—not to mention the many artists they have inspired (Lindsey Buckingham, Janelle Monae, Don Was, and Ryan Tedder among them).\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox\n\nWes Anderson assembled an all-star cast and crew for this gorgeous stop-motion animation adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s novel. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) makes a promise to his wife (Meryl Streep) that he’ll stop his farm-raiding ways when she reveals that she is pregnant. Years later, the crafty canine is feeling angsty and tempted to return to his criminal pastimes when temptation comes knocking right next door. But Mrs. Fox starts to suspect something is amiss when a bounty of fresh food starts finding its way into their home. Even worse, the local farmers are none too happy about being raided by a pesky fox—and band together to do something about it. Noah Baumbach cowrote the script with Anderson, and the cast includes many of Anderson’s most frequent collaborators, including Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson.\n\nJim Henson: Idea Man\n\nWatching the trailer for Jim Henson: Idea Man, it strikes you: How has there not been an exhaustive documentary about Jim Henson before now? Muppets, The Dark Crystal, Sesame Street—the puppeteer had a hand in all of them. In this documentary, Ron Howard looks at Henson's (tireless) work, his incredible impact, and the legacy he left behind.\n\nLet It Be\n\nIf Peter Jackson’s three-part 2021 docuseries Get Back (which is also on Disney+) left you wanting even more unfiltered access to the Beatles, we’ve got both good news and bad news: Let It Be is the 1970 documentary from which much of the footage seen within that series was taken. On the plus side, the original 16-mm print of the film—which has gone mostly unseen for the past 50 years—has undergone a painstaking restoration, courtesy of Jackson (yet again). While it lacks some of the emotional nuance of the series, as we see less of the sometimes-uncomfortable interactions of a band on the verge of their breaking point, it serves as a wonderful time capsule in which it was created. Feel free to pair the two together for one long binge (and throw in Abbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing for good measure).\n\nSummer of Soul\n\nAhmir “Questlove” Thompson made his directorial debut with this feature documentary, which recounts the groundbreaking Harlem Cultural Festival—a six-week-long celebration of Black culture, including music, history, fashion, and beyond. The film features rarely-seen clips of performers such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Sly & the Family Stone. Why have you never heard of the event? Possibly because it was overshadowed by Woodstock, which took place during the same time in the summer of 1969. Ironically, when the film won the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 2022 Academy Awards, it was overshadowed yet again: It’s the award that was being handed out when Will Smith infamously slapped Chris Rock on the stage. (Here’s your chance to rectify missing that acceptance speech.)\n\nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version)\n\nWere you one of the lucky ones who saw Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in person? Did you see Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in theaters? Well guess what? You can now also watch it on Disney+! Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version) is kind of like the one that played at AMC cinemas, but it's also got four new acoustic songs: “You Are in Love,” “Death by a Thousand Cuts,” “I Can See You,” and “Maroon.” It also features the folklore track “Cardigan.” So, whether you saw the tour, the movie theater experience—or neither—there's now yet another way to take in Taylor. Are you ready for it?\n\nX-Men\n\nAny property as beloved as X-Men is bound to have more than a few detractors when it makes the leap from page to screen. But the first X-Men movie managed to impress skeptical comic book fans and newcomers to the mutant war with its compelling storyline and stellar cast, which included Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, and then-newcomer Hugh Jackman. The film kicked off the first in an ever-growing franchise of the battle between mutants and humans, which now totals 13 films and more than $6 billion in box office receipts. With X-Men now officially part of Marvel Studios, expect to see lots more of this expanded cast of characters (beginning with the aforementioned Deadpool & Wolverine and 2026’s highly anticipated Avengers: Doomsday). Until then, though, go back and watch this 2000 classic, and prepare for the future.\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\n\nIt may be impossible to reach the heights achieved by timeless classics like Temple of Doom or Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this latest installment in the Indiana. Jones franchise puts the whip back in Harrison Ford’s hands, letting him fight Nazis and finally get (maybe) some closure to his artifact-hunting life. The movie, directed by James Mangold, also gets some fantastic humor and verve from Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who plays Helena, the daughter of an old ally of Indy’s who has perhaps less-than-pure interest in the Dial of Destiny, an ancient time-travel device that Dr. Jones, of course, thinks belongs in a museum.\n\nSpider-Man: Far From Home\n\nFar From Home, which stars Tom Holland as the Spandex-wearing superhero, is notable for being the first film in Phase Four of the MCU—and the first time we see an Avenger attempting to pick up the pieces following the events of Avengers: Endgame. For Peter Parker, that means taking a boring old class trip to Europe, which turns into anything but when Earth is attacked by a villainous group of Elementals, which Spidey can only fight with the help of the mysterious—and appropriately named—Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal).\n\nMrs. Doubtfire\n\nDaniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is a lightly employed voice actor and devoted dad of three who has just been dumped by his wife and is only allowed to see his children one day per week. So he does what any rational person would do: asks his brother, who just happens to be a makeup artist, to dress him up as an older woman and applies to become a nanny working for his ex-wife Miranda (Sally Field). That Miranda doesn’t realize the person she has entrusted her children with is the man she was married to for more than a decade might speak more about her character. Ignore the ridiculous setup and instead enjoy more than two hours of Robin Williams going full Robin Williams. Bon appétit!\n\nBig\n\nTeenager Josh Baskin (David Moscow) wishes on a Zoltar machine that he could grow up overnight—and comes to find his older self (Tom Hanks) staring him back in the mirror the next morning. In an effort to hide his fast-forwarded body, Baskin hides out in New York City, where he falls backward into his dream job at a toy company and meets the woman of his dreams (Elizabeth Perkins). Big is the movie that made Tom Hanks, well, Tom Hanks (it also marked his first Oscar nomination). But it’s Robert De Niro who was originally set to star; when he was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, Hanks stepped in.\n\nFinding Nemo\n\nNemo (Alexander Gould) is a young clown fish with an imperfect fin and a dad (Albert Brooks) who worries endlessly about his son’s safety. Which is forgivable, given that Nemo’s mom—and all his siblings—were victims of a barracuda shortly before their eggs hatched. So when Nemo is captured while the duo are swimming in the Great Barrier Reef, it’s up to Marlin to find and save his only son. With an all-star cast of voice actors—led by the always-perfect Brooks, and Ellen DeGeneres as a forgetful blue tang named Dory (who would go on to star in her own adventure)—Finding Nemo is part of the heyday of Pixar filmmaking where each film seemed to surpass the absolutely perfect one that preceded it.\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nRob Reiner directs this adventure-comedy-fairytale, written by William Goldman (the legendary screenwriter who once famously said of Hollywood that “nobody knows anything”) from his own novel. The ever-quotable tale tells the story of a young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who is engaged to marry a prince (Chris Sarandon) but is really in love with former farmhand Westley (Carey Elwes), who she believes was killed in a pirate attack. When Buttercup is kidnapped just days ahead of her wedding, a chain of events proceed to possibly reunite the in-love couple, or spell death for one (or both) of them. Goldman was famously critical of his own work, but didn’t mind taking credit for two of his movies. The Princess Bride was one of them (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the other).\n\nThe Little Mermaid\n\nDoes the live-action version of The Little Mermaid improve upon the beloved 1989 animated classic? Of course not. But Disney is on a tear when it comes to reimagining the movies you loved as a kid, and this is one of the Mouse House’s better efforts. Oscar nominee Rob Marshall (Chicago, Mary Poppins Returns, Into the Woods) is behind the camera for this tale of a young mermaid who longs to be (sing it with us) “part of your world.” Yet it’s Halle Bailey, delivering a powerhouse performance as Ariel, who truly makes The Little Mermaid worth watching.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas\n\nWhether you think of Henry Selick’s imaginative stop-motion adventure as a Halloween film or a Christmas movie doesn’t really matter, as there’s never a bad time to add The Nightmare Before Christmas to your watch (or watch-again) list. When the mischief-makers in Halloweentown, including pumpkin king Jack Skellington, discover the magic of Christmas, they decide to kidnap Santa Claus and claim both holidays for themselves. Even in today’s CGI-soaked world, the artistry behind The Nightmare Before Christmas remains painfully impressive—and the macabre yet kid-friendly tone makes it a fun watch for the entire family. There’s also a sing-along version if you’re in the mood.\n\nCinderella\n\nIn case you don’t know the story: After Cinderella loses her beloved mother, her father marries a nasty woman with two equally nasty daughters. While they spend their days tormenting the kind-hearted Cinderella, Prince Charming, the most eligible bachelor in all the land, only has eyes for her. Seventy-five years after its original release, Cinderella remains a Disney classic for a reason. Now it’s back with an impressive 4K restoration that has been several years in the making.\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water\n\nOne week before Avatar hit theaters (for the first time) in late 2009, James Cameron announced his intention to turn the movie into a full-on franchise. But the director took his sweet time in following through. Avatar: The Way of Water—which checks in on blue lovebirds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), now married with children—was released in late 2022, a full 13 years after the original made its debut. But Cameron smartly bought himself some time by setting the film 16 years after the events of Avatar. And while the critical reviews were mixed, it still ended up becoming the third-highest-grossing movie of all time, proving yet again that Cameron has some sort of Midas touch at the box office. We’ll see if that still holds true when the franchise’s third film, Avatar: Fire and Ash, arrives in December.\n\nThe Incredible Hulk\n\nTo Marvel fans, Mark Ruffalo is the only Bruce Banner. But that’s only after Eric Bana tried on the supersized superhero’s tiny purple pants in 2003’s Hulk—and then passed them on to Edward Norton for this 2008 flick, which had the misfortune of hitting theaters just one month after Iron Man. The MCU has always had a messy timeline, but audiences shouldn’t be too quick to write this movie off, particularly those looking to kick back with a solid summer popcorn flick. Norton may lack Ruffalo’s effortless charm, but he’s got the Doc Green part of the character down. While the movie has been largely (and wrongly) forgotten, it did get a bump in February when Liv Tyler found her way into (the new) Bruce's arms when she reprised her roles as love interest Betty Ross in Captain America: Brave New World.\n\nThe Skeleton Dance\n\nFans of classic animation will love every second of the more than two dozen freshly restored old shorts that are part of the Disney+ library. One of the most exciting titles among them is The Skeleton Dance, which revolutionized cartoon culture in 1929. Walt Disney himself wrote, directed, and produced this macabre comedy in which a group of resurrected skeletons rise from their graves and, yep, dance. This is actually much funnier and/or more impressive than it sounds.\n\nStan Lee\n\nEasily the most recognizable name in comics, Stan Lee has had an impact on the medium—and on pop culture broadly—that simply can’t be overstated. Director David Gelb’s documentary about “The Man” delves into not only his legacy, but also his history. Tracing the comics maestro’s life from his early years in New York City to his work cocreating iconic characters like Spider-Man and Black Panther to his time as everyone’s favorite Marvel movie cameo, Stan Lee is essential viewing for any fan.\n\nSpider-Man\n\nWhile Sam Raimi’s Tobey Maguire-starring Spider-Man movies predate the official MCU, the famed director really set the stage for what that future universe would look like, with its mix of solid storytelling, genuine laughs, and impressive visuals. Maguire is perfectly cast as the awkwardly charming Peter Parker, who—having just discovered his superhero powers—is learning to harness them.\n\nVenom\n\nVenom may not have been a hit with critics, but WIRED senior editor Angela Watercutter nailed exactly what the movie was when she called it “a bad movie with great cult-movie potential.” While it rivals Doctor Strange for its stacked cast of serious talent—Tom Hardy in the lead, with Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed costarring, plus Zombieland’s Reuben Fleischer as director—the end result was, well, a bit of a jumbled mess. Nonetheless, it somehow manages to be compelling, even if you just turn it on to watch Hardy mumble, eat Tater Tots, and almost literally chew scenery for 112 minutes.\n\nThe Original Star Wars Trilogy\n\nNaturally, Star Wars is one of the big attractions on Disney+. And it goes without saying, or at least it should, that the films that comprise the original trilogy are the best of the bunch—and the only Star Wars movies you should watch if you’re opting not to binge all dozen or so features. The caveat for pickier fans is that these are the versions that have been messed with by George Lucas post-release. Some things, like the improved visuals in and around Cloud City, are thoughtful additions, but others are more controversial.\n\nThe Star Wars Prequel Trilogy\n\nMore than 20 years after Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope (aka simply Star Wars) helped to define the Hollywood blockbuster, George Lucas returned to the space opera well with an all-new trilogy for an all-new generation of moviegoers. It went about as well as you’d expect. We won’t pretend that The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and/or Revenge of the Sith (2005) have even an ounce of the heart, humor, or heroism of the original films. But they’ve become essential pop culture viewing, and a rite of passage for sci-fi fans, if only to get what all the Jar Jar Binks hate is about.\n\nThe Star Wars Sequel Trilogy\n\nWhen Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012, it was essentially George Lucas handing over the keys to the Millennium Falcon. While fans were rightly skeptical about whether the Mouse House would be able—or even want—to recapture the slightly countercultural environment in which the series was originally created, one hopeful thought united them all: Whatever Disney concocted could not be worse than the Prequel Trilogy. And they were right. By giving the reins to J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens), Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi), then Abrams once again (The Rise of Skywalker), the series became more of a love letter to the original films and the generations of filmmakers—and fans—they inspired. Happily, actors Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver proved worthy successors to the smugglers, scavengers, Jedi masters, and Sith Lords who preceded them.\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nAs WIRED senior writer Jason Parham wrote in his review of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, this movie is haunted by the absence of Chadwick Boseman, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's original King T’Challa who died following a battle with colon cancer in 2020. To that end, writer-director Ryan Coogler had to make a much different kind of superhero film, one that addressed the loss of its main character while also pushing Marvel's cinematic storyline forward into its next phase. “It's rare for MCU films to channel the turbulence of grief with such unflinching focus,” Parham wrote. “Coogler has equipped his sequel with a changed vocabulary: It speaks equally from a place of loss as it does triumph. Grief is its mother tongue.” To that end, the director uses the death of T'Challa to usher in a new Black Panther as well as new heroes (Ironheart) and adversaries-turned-allies (Namor).\n\nTurning Red\n\nMei Lee is a 13-year-old with a problem: Whenever she’s overcome with any sort of overwhelming emotion, which is just about every emotion at that age, she transforms into a giant red panda. Eventually, Mei comes to learn that it’s an inherited family trait. And while there are people who would like to exploit her supernatural powers, she slowly learns that only she has the power to control them. Think of this as a spiritual sequel to 2015’s Inside Out, which explored the complex inner workings of an 11-year-old’s constantly changing emotions.\n\nAbbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing\n\nAbbey Road Studios is best known as the place where the Beatles recorded some of their most iconic albums, including 1969’s Abbey Road. But the hallowed halls of this legendary music studio have played a much bigger role in the music industry, as it has hosted the likes of everyone from Elton John, Pink Floyd, and Aretha Franklin to Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Adele, Oasis, Kate Bush, and Frank Ocean. This documentary, which arrived on the heels of Peter Jackson’s docuseries The Beatles: Get Back (which is also streaming on Disney+ and is highly recommended), is directed by Mary McCartney—daughter of Sir Paul—who practically grew up in the studio and, as such, is able to treat her subject with the reverence it deserves.\n\nAvatar\n\nJames Cameron’s Avatar was all anyone could talk about when it was released in theaters in 2009 and promptly went on to make more than $1 billion, becoming the cinematic iceberg that sank another Cameron epic, 1997’s Titanic, from its place as the highest-grossing movie of all time. For a movie that made so much bank, however, it never occupied a huge space in the cultural conversation about movies. Like so many of Cameron’s works, much of its innovation came from the technology that essentially had to be invented to make it possible.\n\nIron Man\n\nThe MCU has released nearly three dozen films since 2008, yet the very first of them—Iron Man—remains one of the best. It’s almost impossible to believe how hard director Jon Favreau had to fight to get Robert Downey Jr. the leading role, as he’s arguably one of the MCU’s most beloved figures. Before there was a whole franchise plus a shared TV universe, Downey, as Tony Stark/Iron Man, was just allowed to do his thing. It was a gamble that paid off for all involved.\n\nWest Side Story\n\nFrom Martin Scorsese to Spike Lee, pretty much every great director has made—or at least tried to make—a grand Hollywood musical, perhaps one of the toughest genres to successfully pull off. Steven Spielberg made the task even more difficult when he decided to adapt Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, and ​​Arthur Laurents’ West Side Story—which Robert Wise already did to great acclaim in 1961. But, Spielberg (being Spielberg) managed to create an updated take on the story of Tony (Ansel Elgort) and Maria (Rachel Zegler), two love-struck teens caught in the middle of an escalating rivalry between two street gangs, the Sharks and the Jets. The update gives nods to the original (like casting Rita Moreno, who won an Oscar for her role as Anita in Wise’s film) while improving on some of its controversial aspects (like casting Natalie Wood in the role of a Puerto Rican teen).\n\nLady and the Tramp\n\nSure, you can watch the live-action/CGI version that Disney+ released shortly after it launched, but why bother when the 1955 original is here too? Put aside the rather vulgar stereotypes that were common at the time (the movie now comes with a warning, though it was recently reworded) and Lady and the Tramp remains one of the most iconic Disney animations, and a love story for the ages. When a spoiled cocker spaniel named Lady finds herself competing with a new baby for the attention of her parents, she ends up getting loose and befriending a mangy but charming mutt named Tramp. Ultimately, Lady needs to choose between the pampered life she’s always known with Jim Dear and Darling, or a life of spaghetti dinner discards with the hopelessly romantic Tramp—unless there’s another way.\n\nThe Muppet Movie\n\nBetween The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie, Jim Henson and the Muppets were everywhere in 1979. Their first big-screen outing serves as more of a prequel, as it follows Kermit the Frog’s journey from a swamp in Florida to Hollywood, where he’s headed to pursue his dreams of becoming a movie star. Along the way, we get to witness where and how he meets the fellow members of his felt-made crew, from Fozzie Bear to Miss Piggy. Hijinks ensue when a restaurateur named Doc Hopper doesn’t take too kindly to Kermit turning down his offer to serve as the official legs of his chain’s famous fried frog legs, and follows the frog in order to seek revenge.\n\nLuca\n\nEnrico Casarosa’s Luca earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature in 2022 for its sweet and soulful story about a young boy named Luca who is hiding a dark secret: He's a sea monster living in a town on the Italian Riviera that absolutely despises his kind. Ultimately, Luca is a moving coming-of-age film about friendship, family, and overcoming our own prejudices—and truly one of Pixar’s best features.\n\nCaptain Marvel\n\nMarvel's biggest mistake in the entire MCU canon (so far) was not commissioning Captain Marvel sooner. The film, set in the past, sees the rise of Marvel (Brie Larson) as she discovers her origin story and develops her powers. The film, the first entry in the Marvel universe with a female lead, channels the spirit of the 1990s both in its setting and in style, with heaping spoonfuls of Samuel L. Jackson and all the plot and subtlety of a blockbuster action movie. Larson adds a healthy dose of sarcasm to undercut her character’s immense power, and Jackson is eerily brilliant, making for a super fun 123 minutes.\n\nAnt-Man\n\nWho doesn’t love a heist movie? Paul Rudd’s MCU debut acted as something of a palate cleanser after the heavy, literally Earth-shattering events of Age of Ultron. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a reformed criminal who teams up with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter (Evangeline Lily) to keep Pym’s shrinking technology from falling into the wrong hands. The film’s depiction of quantum physics wouldn’t hold much water at CERN, but it’s terrific fun—thanks in part to Michael Peña’s star turn as Lang’s former cellmate Luis and, of course, Rudd’s legendary likability. If you want to make it a Rudd-athon, both Ant-Man and the Wasp and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania are streaming, too.\n\nMulan\n\nIn the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and its shutdown of almost the entire movie industry, Disney decided to try something new with its live-action version of Mulan by making it available to Disney+ subscribers instead of releasing it in theaters. The film itself is one of the latest in Disney’s recent string of live-action remakes and sees Liu Yifei in the title role, with reviews praising the cast, visuals, and action sequences.\n\nAvengers: Endgame\n\nThere's a moment in the event-movie-to-endgame-all-event-movies when you realize that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have gone full Harry Potter and the Cursed Child all over the MCU. Once you get past the rather glum beginning, you can settle in for what you have come to expect from any Avengers movie: Tony Stark cracking wise; Doctor Strange doing weird things with his hands; Professor Hulk explaining the science of what’s going on; and Black Widow and Captain Marvel kicking ass, both emotionally and physically. It's a messy but epic baton-pass in the form of an angsty portal-powered mega-battle. And we're not going to lie: We've watched those audience reaction videos, and they too are a thing of joy.\n\nHamilton\n\nIf you only know Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical from the obscenely high ticket prices and snippets of the soundtrack, here’s your chance to find out what all the fuss is about. A version of the production, recorded via a six-camera setup over two performances by the original Broadway cast, was put on Disney+ after plans to release it in cinemas were scrapped. Aside from a couple of censored swear words and the fact that it's directed (by Thomas Kail), it's essentially the same show—an energetic, empathetic, witty, quippy hip-hop musical about US founding father Alexander Hamilton.\n\nMoana\n\nOne of the potential answers to “What, oh, what to put on after Frozen and Frozen 2?” Moana is in fact better than Frozen. By that we simply mean better soundtrack, better heroine, better visuals, and better side quests. There's also 100 percent more Dwayne Johnson as a tattooed demigod and Jemaine Clement as a giant crab doing a Bowie impression. Set thousands of years ago on the fictional, Polynesia-inspired island of Motunui, Moana's hero's journey is fairly classic, but the sumptuous animation and Lin-Manuel Miranda tunes are top-tier Disney. (Sure, we'd love to see Taika Waititi's original script, but we can live without it.) Moana 2, last year’s less well-received sequel, is now also streaming on Disney+ (as are sing-along versions for both films).\n\nFree Solo\n\nIf your friend told you they'd decided to solo-climb up the sheer 3,000-foot granite El Capitan wall in Yosemite, California, with no rope, you’d think they had gone mad. But that’s exactly what Alex Honnold set out to do back in 2017. Honnold’s quest to climb the vertical wall was documented by his two director friends, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, as he took on the ascent to become the world’s first person to free-climb El Capitan. But it’s not just about the ascent, it’s also about Honnold’s complicated life, his emotional issues, and all the things that have driven him to pursue one of the most dangerous missions ever attempted by any free climber. The cinematography in Free Solo is also dizzyingly beautiful, and the entire thing will have you gripping the arm of your chair in terror.\n\nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids\n\nWayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is an experimental inventor who creates an electromagnetic shrinking machine. Naturally, he accidentally shrinks his own children (if you didn’t already guess that from the title), plus the kids from next door, then unwittingly throws them in the trash. To have any chance of becoming their normal size again, the teeny tots must navigate their way across the family's (now seemingly gigantic) yard and back to the house. It's something fraught with peril when you're half the size of an aspirin.\n\nToy Story (All of Them)\n\nWhile it initially might have seemed as if Pixar could never make anything as good as the original 1995 Toy Story, each of the three subsequent films add depth to the franchise's canon. All of the movies are critically acclaimed—and they're all available on Disney+. When combined, the four films tell a story about growing up and how everything in life, inevitably, changes. Woody (Tom Hanks) and the gang go from learning how to deal with new people to understanding loss. It's something that's also followed the cast: In Toy Story 4, the voice of Mr. Potato Head was created through archive recordings after Don Rickles, as the man behind the voice, died ahead of the film's release.\n\nThe Lion King\n\nRemember the terrifying wildebeest stampede in the 1994 version of The Lion King? That was actually computer animated, because drawing them by hand would have taken a long, long time. Special attention was taken to blend it into the cel-shaded backgrounds, and this was all before Toy Story came out the following year. Which is all to say that not only is the '90s version a perfect movie that had absolutely zero need for a charm-deficient 2019 remake (which is also streaming on Disney+ in case you want to compare), it’s also the best Lion King to use CG animation.\n\n10 Things I Hate About You\n\nHeath Ledger singing “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” on the bleachers. That’s the iconic scene in this top-caliber high school romcom. The plot is taken from The Taming of the Shrew, the cast—including Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt—are all adorable, and the late '90s nostalgia is potent. Offering some much-needed variety from the sci-fi and animation that dominates the Disney+ launch catalog, 10 Things I Hate About You is as good as comfort-food movies get.\n\nTron & Tron: Legacy\n\nTron and its modern sequel, Tron: Legacy, aren't your typical Disney films. The original sees a programmer (Jeff Bridges) become trapped inside a computer system where he meets and befriends programs, including the eponymous hero Tron, who are resisting the power of a growing artificial intelligence, the Master Control Program. It became a sci-fi cult classic, leading to the creation of a modern sequel that continues the story and features an epic score cowritten by Daft Punk. Both are watchable distractions, even if the sequel feels a little thin in places.\n\nWillow\n\nAnother nostalgia fest, this time for fans of '80s fantasy. Willow is a family-friendly, mythic quest that’s best seen as George Lucas and Ron Howard’s fun, $35 million Tolkien fan fiction. The story of a farmer tasked with protecting a magic baby from an evil queen is not exactly the most original story in the world, but that hasn’t stopped this from becoming a classic, with Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood and Val Kilmer waving a sword around. Classic Sunday afternoon fare.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nWinter Soldier is among the best Marvel movies. It makes time for quieter character moments, and the action, while still spectacular, feels a little more grounded and real than the CGI-fueled shock and awe of the mainline movies. In this outing, Captain America faces off against a rogue element of SHIELD led by Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce.\n\nThor: Ragnarok\n\nThe first two Thor films were among the worst in the whole series—Chris Hemsworth’s thunder god was dour and charmless. But here, director Taika Waititi injected some much-needed color into the proceedings, borrowing heavily from the Planet Hulk storyline from the comics. Thor finds himself stranded on a bizarre planet, ruled over by Jeff Goldblum (who is pretty much playing himself). There, he crosses paths with Bruce Banner’s Hulk, who has been missing since the events of Civil War. It’s hugely funny, and arguably the best film of the series.\n\nRogue One: A Star Wars Story\n\nThe newer Star Wars one-off films attract strong opinions, and Rogue One is no different. But while it has its issues, it fills an important hole in the universe and features some of the best action sequences in the entire saga. Its main black mark is the rather iffy CGI recreation of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin, but it's still a fun romp that lacks the narrative baggage of the new trilogy.\n\nBlack Panther\n\nBlack Panther had a huge cultural impact. It was refreshingly unusual to see a blockbuster superhero film with such a diverse cast—and the Afrofuturist setting was unlike anything Marvel had ever done before. Michael B. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger, who returns to his father’s home to claim the throne from T’Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman).\n\nWALL·E\n\nReleased in 2008, a time when, for many, the climate crisis felt like a distant, abstract threat, WALL·E is classic Pixar. It’s a love story—sort of—that focuses on two robots. But it’s also a story about survival, believing in yourself, and dancing through the vacuum of space propelled by a fire extinguisher. The animation, especially on the desolate, barren Earth, is a sight to behold. The opening scenes of the film are also basically a silent film, with the score and robotic sound effects doing a fantastic job bringing out the emotion and drama of what’s happening.\n\nUp\n\nPixar's Up can claim one of the most moving opening scenes of any movie. Despite being released more than a decade ago, in 2009, the animation hasn't aged or lost any of its charm. In a little over 90 minutes, director Pete Docter takes us on the journey of Carl, an old widower who is seeking out Paradise Falls. Carl's trip in his flying house is made in memory of his wife, Ellie, who had always wanted to visit the falls. The film won two Oscars—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score—but was also nominated for three more. These included Best Picture, which at the time made it only the second animated film to have received the nomination (1991’s Beauty and the Beast—which is also streaming on Disney+, and most definitely worth a rewatch—was the first).\n\nThe Jungle Book\n\nWhatever mood you're in, Disney+ has The Jungle Book to suit it. The streaming service has both the 1967 animated classic, with its catchy soundtrack and moments of humor, plus the live-action version released in 2016. The two films couldn't be more different. If you want to go for full family entertainment, pick the original, but if you're after something a little darker, the modern remake is where you should head. (Bonus fact: The entire live-action film was shot in a warehouse.)\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy\n\nThe first volume of Guardians of the Galaxy didn't burst into the MCU until 2014, which is relatively late considering Phase One began with Iron Man in 2008. However, it's become a firm fan favorite, providing some of the Universe's most memorable (and important) characters. Quill, Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Nebula are all distinctive and in many ways more likable than other key MCU characters. Guardians is worth returning to if you want to remember a slightly simpler time before Thanos' Snap.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"right\", \"movie\", \"star\", \"65\", \"original\", \"best\", \"films\", \"life\", \"wars\", \"movies\", \"disney\", \"film\"]", "content_hash": "a5ba18b3ac75e04c24eeebf921fd99aede829dea69a51acbd3cf2cd5b2dd5cbf", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:40.272927+00:00"}

Just one month after the premiere of the new live-action series Ironheart (see below) comes this new animated anthology series that delves even further into the Wakanda mythology. Two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Coogler—the man behind both Black Panther movies—developed this four-episode prequel in which the Hatut Zaraze, aka Wakanda’s “War Dogs,” embark on adventure-filled missions to retrieve long-lost Vibranium artifacts.\n\nIronheart\n\nRyan Coogler is responsible for what is arguably the best movie in the MCU (2018’s Black Panther), and now he’s executive producing one of its most interesting small-screen endeavors. Playwright Chinaka Hodge created this series, which picks up right after the events featured in 2022’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It stars Dominique Thorne, who reprises her role as Riri Williams, aka Ironheart, a brilliant MIT student who has successfully managed to create a Tony Stark–like suit of armor. It gives her the kind of invincibility that changes her outlook on the world—and leads her down a pothole-filled path that could see her heroic character go the way of the antihero in a way that critics have described as being similar to The Sopranos’ Tony Soprano and Breaking Bad’s Walter White.\n\nUnderdogs\n\nRyan Reynolds brings his penchant for turning genres on their heads to National Geographic with a brand-new kind of nature special. The Deadpool star narrates and serves as executive producer on this fun docuseries which puts the spotlight on the “underdogs” of the animal kingdom—those creatures and critters who don’t always warrant the same amount of respect as the kings and queens they share real estate with. Or, as Reynolds calls them, the “super zeroes.”\n\nDoctor Who\n\nSpring 2024 marked the beginning of a new era for Doctor Who fans when Ncuti Gatwa was officially handed the sonic screwdriver to take the legendary sci-fi series in new directions as the Fifteenth Doctor. He did it all over again with a second season, which aired a game-changing finale on May 31 that has viewers wondering where the Doctor will be headed next. Russell T. Davies is also back to oversee all the time-traveling shenanigans as the latest incarnation of the Time Lord journeys through space and time with companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), and new addition Belinda Chandra (Varada Sethu). While the series will keep its standing as a BBC staple in the UK and Ireland, American audiences will need to head to Disney+ to experience it all.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Underworld\n\nThere are two types of people in this world: those who think there are more Star Wars movies and TV shows that one person needs and those who are counting down the days until The Mandalorian & Grogu arrives in theaters next year. If you’re part of that latter group, you’re in good company—and have plenty of series to choose from, including this six-part anthology that follows 2022’s Tales of the Jedi and last year’s Tales of the Empire (see below). In true Star Wars style, it tells the story of two villains, former assassin/bounty hunter Asajj Ventress and outlaw Cad Bane, who form an unlikely alliance in an attempt to build new lives for themselves, until Bane catches up with an old colleague, who has switched sides to become a law-abiding marshal. Dark versus light battle it out once more.\n\nAndor\n\nAndor, which just scored 14 Emmy nominations, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, is something of a miracle. Created by Tony Gilroy, the two-time Oscar nominee behind Michael Clayton and a writer on the Bourne movies, it’s the origin story of one of Rogue One's most beloved characters, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). Set in the early years of the Rebellion, it charts Andor’s path to becoming one of the most integral of the Rebels. With a supporting cast that includes Fiona Shaw and Stellan Skarsgård, it features a fantastic score from Nicholas Britell (Moonlight, Succession). After spending so much time with Mandalorians and Jedis, it’s a welcome reprieve and perhaps the closest thing to prestige TV the Star Wars universe has released.\n\nOklahoma City Bombing: One Day in America\n\nThirty years after the Oklahoma City Bombing, Nat Geo takes a look back at the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The three-part docuseries features rarely seen archival footage and interviews with survivors who are sharing their harrowing stories for the first time. While it’s undoubtedly a tragic story, the series also recounts the inspiring way in which it united Americans.\n\nDaredevil: Born Again\n\nDaredevil fans were devastated when the original Netflix series was canceled in 2018, but Charlie Cox never strayed far from his title role for too long. He popped up as Matt Murdock/Daredevil in MCU movies (Spider-Man: No Way Home) and TV shows (She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Echo, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man), all the while biding his time until his eponymous series came back. Seven years and one massive overhaul later, fans seem to think it was worth the wait. Born Again sees Cox facing off against crime lord turned mayoral candidate Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) once more. There’s also a darkness to the series that seems to borrow a page from Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight playbook, though it’s not as elegant in its execution. Still, it’s a solid crime drama that sets itself apart from many other MCU series thanks to its more mature tone. Whether you were into the Netflix series or not, it might be time to dig in.\n\nWin or Lose\n\nWill Forte, Rhea Seehorn, Ian Chen, Melissa Villaseñor, and Izaac Wang are among the dozens of actors and comedians who lend their voices to Pixar’s very first original animated series. Over the course of eight episodes, this charming series plays out the same events that occur in the week leading up to a middle school softball team’s championship game from the perspective of various characters, including a wise bead of sweat known as Sweaty (and voiced by comedian Jo Firestone). If the title sounds familiar to you, it might be because the series created some controversy back in December when it was revealed that a transgender character’s storyline had been cut from the series. Disney’s reasoning? “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”\n\nYour Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man\n\nFour years after it was first announced, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man arrived early this year. The animated series dares to imagine what kind of chaos might have ensued if Peter Parker (Hudson Thames) had been mentored by baddie Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Colman Domingo) instead of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Oh, the horror (and fun)! A second season has already been confirmed, though likely won’t premiere until 2026.\n\nGoosebumps: The Vanishing\n\nFor more than 30 years, R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps books have fed the nightmares of young readers—much to their delight (well, usually). Now Disney is inspiring a whole new generation of horror lovers with this fun series, which follows the lives of a group of high schoolers who begin to unravel the terrifying truth about a decades-old murder—and the roles their nearest and dearest might have played in it—in their otherwise picture-perfect hometown. The always-affable Justin Long starred as a teacher who may or may not be possessed in season 1 of this anthology series. Its second, and final, season brought an extended title (Goosebumps: The Vanishing), a new cast (including Friends star David Schwimmer), and a whole new set of nightmares.\n\nStar Wars: Skeleton Crew\n\nDo you love Star Wars but wish it had more Warriors/The Wizard of Oz/The Brave Little Toaster energy? Lucasfilm has heard your cries and is here to oblige. For Skeleton Crew, they assembled a gang of four youths who get lost in the Star Wars universe and try to find their way home with the help of Jude Law, who plays an “enigmatic scoundrel\" named Jod. OK, so Star Wars probably already has enough of those, but who cares? The real treasure is the friends you'll make along the way.\n\nLuther\n\nAdd DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) to the long list of “conflicted cops who mean well.” It's a character archetype that TV viewers have seen dozens of times before, but few actors take it to the level that Elba does. Forget bending the rules—Luther dismantles them and has no regrets. Planting evidence? Killing a criminal? Buddying up to a homicidal sociopath who can take the real “bad guys” out on your behalf? Luther has seen and done it all in the name of justice. Somehow it’s hard not to root for him at every turn.\n\nLego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy\n\nSig Greebling (Stranger Things’ Gaten Matarazzo) discovers an ancient relic that alters the history of the universe—turning Jar Jar Binks into a lightsaber-wielding Sith and Luke Skywalker into Just Some Guy. With the help of a wise old Jedi, Sig must do what he can to piece things back together. Sure, the plotline has all the makings of a typical Star Wars story, but with Mark Hamill and Ahmed Best lending their voices to the minifig versions of the characters that made them famous, it also does so in a way that pokes just the right amount of fun at the canon.\n\nAgatha All Along\n\nAfter Kathryn Hahn became the (not-so-surprising) breakout star of 2021’s WandaVision miniseries (more on that below), MCU fans were thrilled—but, again, not surprised—when she nabbed her own series with Agatha All Along. The long-awaited spinoff takes place three years after the events of WandaVision, with witch Agatha (now stripped of all her magical powers) enlisting a teenager (Joe Locke) and a new coven to help her regain her status as HWIC. Aubrey Plaza, Patti LuPone, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp round out the stellar cast.\n\nBluey\n\nYes, Bluey is technically a children’s show. But everyone is welcome to enjoy this animated series from Australia, which centers around an endlessly curious blue heeler pup named Bluey and her family (mom, dad, and little sister). The show’s brevity—each episode clocks in at around eight minutes, and there are also mini episodes that are half that run time—is part of what makes it such a fun and easy watch. But the exploration of everyday feelings and emotions that everyone can relate to (humans, too) have made it a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Rose Byrne, Natalie Portman, and Eva Mendes are among the stars who have lent their voices to the show.\n\nArctic Ascent With Alex Honnold\n\nIn Free Solo (which is also streaming on Disney+), climber Alex Honnold dared to do the unthinkable, becoming the first person to free solo climb the 3,000-foot rock wall of Yosemite’s El Capitan. For most people, that dauntless endeavor would have been enough adventure for one lifetime. But Alex Honnold is not most people, as this three-part National Geographic docuseries makes clear. Here, he travels to Greenland with fellow climbers to conquer more unclimbed spaces in one of the most remote corners of the world. Vicarious anxiety never felt so exciting.\n\nStar Wars: Young Jedi Adventures\n\nIf helping to raise a new generation of Star Wars geeks was even a small part of your reason for having kids, this animated series, which is basically the Star Wars version of Muppet Babies, is a great place to start their education. Set during the High Republic era, approximately 200 years before the events of The Phantom Menace, it follows a group of young Jedis—Jedi Lites—who are sometimes stumbling their way through learning the ways of the Force. Like any good kid series, it also teaches important lessons about life and making a positive difference in the world.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nA Jedi turning to the Dark Side is a concept as old as the Star Wars franchise itself, and not something fans have given much thought to in terms of the “why.” But this Disney+ series dares to ask that question, and plays out a bit like a true crime procedural in a sci-fi landscape. Carrie-Anne Moss stars as a Jedi Master, and if her character seems a bit like Trinity from The Matrix series, that’s by design. Series creator Leslye Headland told Empire that the character owes much of its inspiration to the Wachowskis’ movies and that Moss’ Indara is basically “Trinity with a lightsaber.” In August, Disney announced that one season is all we’re going to get of The Acolyte, so savor all eight episodes.\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Empire\n\nIt’s been more than five years since Disney released the last Star Wars movie, and The Mandalorian & Grogu won't arrive until May 22, 2026. Fortunately, Disney+ has plenty of TV series to fill the void, including this animated anthology that adds new stories about the franchise’s Galactic empire, in the same time period in which the original trilogy existed. It follows the very different journeys of two characters: Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto), a Force-sensitive human and member of the Nightsister coven who, after being one of the few of her people to survive the Clone Wars, is seeking revenge. Meanwhile, Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger) is a former Jedi who is questioning her own disillusionment with the order and what her road ahead looks like. Both are forced to make decisions that will change their individual destinies, and the galaxy far, far away with it.\n\nX-Men '97\n\nOf all the big-budget X-Men movies and TV shows that have existed over the years, it’s hard to believe that a cartoon series from the ’90s is one of the most beloved entries. But it’s true—and has a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score to prove it. When the revival arrived in 2024, many of the original voice actors returned to reclaim their characters, who must learn how to navigate a world without Professor Xavier to guide them. The events of this series pick up just one year after the point where the original show (which you can read more about below) ended.\n\nRenegade Nell\n\nLouisa Harland shines as Nell Jackson, the renegade of the title, who accidentally becomes one of the most feared highwaywomen in 18th-century England after she is framed for murder. Of course, this being a Disney series, it’s best to expect something a little magical—which in Nell’s case is Billy Blind, a magical sprite sent to help her realize her true destiny. What is surprising is that the series, which is perfectly suited to teens and their families, was created by Sally Wainwright, the brilliant mind behind such adult-themed series as Happy Valley and Gentleman Jack.\n\nDinosaurs\n\nNineties kids no doubt remember this sitcom about a family of dinosaurs. Earl Sinclair is a fortysomething megalosaurus living with his family in Pangaea circa 60,000,000 BC. While his days are spent working as a tree pusher (yep, he pushes over trees), he lives for his family: wife Fran and kids Robbie, Charlene, and Baby Sinclair, whose running gag of hitting his dad over the head with a frying pan and shouting “Gotta love me!” never gets old. Not even three decades on.\n\nEcho\n\nThis Marvel series continues the studio’s recent trend of shining a spotlight on its fearless—and complicated—female characters. In this case, that character is Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox), aka Echo, who is best known to audiences as a baddie from Hawkeye. But over the course of its relatively short five episodes, we learn why Maya—one of the MCU’s few deaf characters—must reconcile the events of her past and reconnect with her Native American roots in order to confront the future she has created for herself. Cox may be a relative newcomer to Hollywood, but she deftly manages to shoulder the weight of an entire MCU series.\n\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians\n\nNearly 20 years after the release of the first book in Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series, this small-screen adaptation of that first title is being praised for how faithful it has remained to Riordan’s beloved words. Being a tween is hard enough, but for 12-year-old Perseus “Percy” Jackson (Walker Scobell) it gets even harder when he learns he's the son of Poseidon, god of the sea, and that he has pissed off his uncle, Zeus, who believes that Percy has stolen his thunderbolt. (And you thought having a zit was bad!) Fortunately for Percy there is Camp Half-Blood—a place where demigods like himself can learn to harness their powers and use them for good. It’s there that Percy learns the whole “with great power comes great responsibility” thing and embraces it—even if he'd rather be playing video games with his friends. A second season is set to arrive in December, with Season 3 already in the works.\n\nBehind the Attraction\n\nDisneyland, Walt Disney’s very first theme park, opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955. In the 70 years since, Disney parks have become a worldwide phenomenon and inspired rabid fan bases who make annual (if not more frequent) pilgrimages to these so-called Happiest Places on Earth. But what goes on behind the scenes? From the creation of major attractions like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean to its bustling food scene (Dole Whip, anyone?), this docuseries goes behind the scenes of the world’s most famous amusement parks.\n\nLoki\n\nThe MCU is exhaustingly huge. Yet while Loki is undoubtedly part of that universe, the series could just as easily work as a stand-alone piece, and it's all the more fun and surprising as a result. There are enough plot twists, silly one-liners, and time-travel antics to keep everyone entertained, and even a wisecracking alligator. If that doesn’t do it, Loki has a visual effects budget that would put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. Sure, it’s not the most intellectually stimulating show out there, but Tom Hiddleston does a great job of turning Loki into a fairly complex, interesting character. No word yet on whether there might be a third season in Loki’s future—and even Hiddleston is in the dark. “I truly don’t know,” he admitted to Variety in 2024, adding: “There have been other times when I thought that it was the end and I have been mistaken. But if this is the end, I'm so proud of where we ended up.”\n\nDaredevil\n\nBefore Disney+ became the home for all of Marvel’s TV content, Netflix was the place to find it—beginning with Daredevil, in which blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) spends his days seeking justice and his nights looking for revenge as a masked vigilante attempting to rid his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of its criminal element. While the series ended in 2018, Cox has reprised his role for a new series, Daredevil: Born Again, which arrived in early March (see above).\n\nAhsoka\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: Wait, another Star Wars series? And we don’t blame you for asking the question. But for old-school franchise fans, Ahsoka just might surprise you. Rosario Dawson reprises the title role as Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi who studied under Anakin Skywalker, which she first played in season 2 of The Mandalorian. Here, Ahsoka sets off on a journey to locate Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen, Mads’ brother)—a master manipulator who seems to be on a mission to become the grand ruler of the galaxy. A second season is scheduled to begin production in April, and will welcome Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker back into the Star Wars fold.\n\nThe Wonder Years\n\nIn 2021, writer-producer Saladin K. Patterson (Frasier, The Bernie Mac Show) rebooted the award-winning, and much beloved, series The Wonder Years for a new generation. Don Cheadle narrates the adventures of Dean Williams (Elisha “EJ” Williams), as he comes of age in Montgomery, Alabama, in the final years of the Civil Rights Movement. Both seasons of the worthwhile series are now streaming—as are all six seasons of the original series, which premiered in 1988.\n\nKizazi Moto: Generation Fire\n\nWhile Black Panther may have gotten an official sequel with 2022’s Wakanda Forever (which is, of course, available to stream on Disney+), this animated anthology series is in many ways a spiritual successor to that Oscar-winning MCU flick. More than a dozen up-and-coming African storytellers were handpicked to write and/or direct these 10 short films, which build on the makers’ cultures and histories to paint a fascinating, gorgeously animated—and often dystopian—picture of Afrofuturism.\n\nAmerican Born Chinese\n\nOscar winners—and Everything Everywhere All at Once costars—Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan reunite for this Disney+ original series. Jin Wang (Ben Wang) is your typical teenager who’s just trying to get through the day of dealing with high school social hierarchies. But his life is forever altered when he’s asked to serve as a mentor to Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), a foreign exchange student who is hiding some pretty big secrets. Like that he’s actually on an otherworldly mission from the heavenly realm and has chosen Jin to serve as his guide. Part coming-of-age tale and part mythological fantasy, the single-season series is a formidable adaptation of Gene Yang’s graphic novel.\n\nStar Wars: Visions\n\nFor a franchise as varied and diverse as Star Wars, sometimes its output can feel a little same-y. That’s not the case with Visions. The point of the anthology series is to provide “all-new, creative” takes on the Star Wars universe. The first series, which premiered in 2021, featured nine installments from some of the best anime studios in Japan, including Kamikaze Douga and Trigger. The second anthology, which arrived in 2023, broadens the scope further, incorporating work from studios in India, Ireland, Spain, Chile, France, South Africa, the US, and the UK. If you’re looking for the best one-off tales from the Star Wars universe, look no further.\n\nThe Mandalorian\n\nThe Mandalorian was, and is, exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed. Everything about this Jon Favreau series feels like classic TV—from the episodic adventures to the cameos. Set in the outer reaches of the galaxy, it follows a moody, masked Mandalorian bounty hunter (WIRED cover star Pedro Pascal) and really delivers on the hype with its retro-futuristic robots, salty Space Western vibes, lack of Skywalker baggage, and, of course, Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). The Mandalorian really set the tone for what a great Star Wars series could be, and while not every subsequent show has been as good, others, like Andor, have lived up to the precedent it set—and proved Star Wars stories can make for great TV. There's still no official word on a fourth season, but there is one more exciting adventure on the horizon: a movie, The Mandalorian & Grogu, which just got a May 22, 2026 release date.\n\nMs. Marvel\n\nWith Ms. Marvel, Disney manages to combine its knack for producing coming-of-age tween fare with its new role as caretaker of the MCU. Iman Vellani charms as Kamala Khan, an Avengers-obsessed high schooler from Jersey City who feels like an outsider in most areas of her life. But when a gold bangle arrives from her grandmother in Pakistan, Kamala begins to realize that all the time she's spent fantasizing about what life would be like with superpowers might have been preparing her for real life. With one foot in the teen drama world and the other in the comic book universe, Ms. Marvel—which just happens to feature Marvel’s first Muslim superhero—marks yet another admirable step forward for the company in both innovation and inclusion. In 2023, Vellani’s Ms. Marvel made the leap to the big screen to star alongside Brie Larson in The Marvels.\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi\n\nEwan McGregor has not always had the kindest words for the Star Wars prequels in which he first played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi—a role he inherited from Alec Guinness, who also had plenty of less-than-favorable things to say about the franchise. So it was somewhat surprising when Lucasfilm announced that McGregor would be donning his Jedi gear again to star in a stand-alone Star Wars series for Disney+. (Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has already said there will not be a second season.) In many ways, however, it allowed McGregor and former costar Hayden Christensen to course-correct some of their earlier work, as it follows a downtrodden Obi-Wan attempting to process his personal and professional disappointment over losing Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) to the Dark Side.\n\nThe Beatles: Get Back\n\nIn January 1969, just more than a year before they announced they were breaking up, the Beatles allowed a film crew unprecedented access to the creative process and recording of Let It Be, which would be their final studio album. Fifty years later, Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson was presented with the nearly 60 hours of film footage and more than 150 hours of audio that resulted from this project, and he remastered it and turned it into a three-part docuseries. Whether you’re already a Beatles fan or not, the documentary is a fascinating look at the creative process of one of the music world’s most influential bands as they work against the clock to finish recording an album, decide to have a free concert on their label’s rooftop, and occasionally butt heads. Knowing what the subjects do not know—that this will be the last time they perform live together or record an album—only adds to the project’s intimacy. The miniseries won all five Emmys it was nominated for in 2022, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.\n\nMoon Knight\n\nOscar Isaac brings yet another marquee name to Marvel’s growing roster of all-star talents with Moon Night. Here, Isaac plays a man with dissociative identity disorder, giving us not one but three distinct characters: mercenary Mark Spector, British gift shop employee Steven Grant, and the mysterious—and seemingly ominous—Jake Lockley. Ultimately, he must face off against himself to get the answers he’s seeking. For Moon Knight, Isaac told Empire that he was thrilled to be able to do something “really fucking nutty on a major stage”—and he delivers.\n\nThe Muppet Show\n\nWhile The Muppet Show, which ran for five seasons between 1976 and 1981, is considered a piece of classic television today, it wasn’t always smooth sailing for creator Jim Henson. Henson produced two one-off Muppet specials that were intended to take the show into prime time, but neither came to fruition. Fortunately, the Muppets did have a recurring gig in “The Land of Gorch” sketches that aired during Saturday Night Live’s first season, as viewers of Jason Reitman's Saturday Night learned. When SNL became a hit, Henson knew that there was a potentially massive audience for an adult-oriented Muppet show (not to mention celebrity connections to entice plenty of A-list names to host). The rest is Muppet history.\n\nThe Punisher\n\nThe Punisher is yet another Netflix-turned-Disney+ Marvel series that also happens to be a spinoff of Daredevil. Like Daredevil, the Punisher (real name: Frank Castle, played by Jon Bernthal) is a vigilante who seems to relish exacting revenge, regardless of the results. He and Daredevil operate within the same universe, and while the Punisher sort of admires Daredevil’s quest for true justice, Daredevil despises the Punisher’s by-any-means-necessary methods. Bernthal brings an intensity to the role that, while undoubtedly violent, also has a sense of humor about it.\n\nBoy Meets World\n\nIf ABC’s TGIF lineup wasn’t a part of your night as a kid, you clearly didn’t grow up in the ’90s. But Disney+ is happy to right that wrong by housing all seven seasons of the teen sitcom in its library. Corey Matthews (Ben Savage) deals with the ups and downs of growing up and ever-evolving relationships with friends and family—plus that one teacher, Mr. Feeny (William Daniels)—who always has the right answer to your problems, whether you like it or not. As the show progressed and the kids grew up, serious issues like drugs and sex were thrown into the mix, which didn’t always please the network. When the show aired on the original Disney Channel, a few episodes weren’t included in the lineup because of the more mature subject matter. You can also check out all three seasons of Girl Meets World, the series reboot (which features Corey as the parent and Mr. Feeny) when you’re done.\n\nJessica Jones\n\nJust about six months after Daredevil arrived on the scene, Netflix took another chance on a Marvel property with Jessica Jones. In this dark dive into the world of superheroes, Krysten Ritter plays a private investigator who gave up her days as a superhero after a major catastrophe. But you can’t deny who you are, as Jessica discovers when it seems like every case that comes her way forces her to confront her past—and the supervillain Kilgrave (David Tennant), who turned her into a shell of her former self.\n\nHawkeye\n\nYet another in an ever growing string of spinoff TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hawkeye gives some long overdue attention to Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton, who in many ways has often seemed like the forgotten Avenger. The supernaturally skilled archer is in most of the ensemble Avengers films, but this Disney+ series marks his first solo outing. The show sees Hawkeye teaming up with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), a precocious twentysomething who shares his skills for slinging arrows but lacks his eye for danger. It’s set during the holidays, and there are shades of Die Hard as the eponymous character tries to save the day and make it home in time for Christmas. Let the arguments about whether it’s a Christmas TV show begin.\n\nMonsters at Work\n\nMonsters at Work is the Monsters, Inc. spinoff you didn’t know you needed. It picks up the action six months after the end of the iconic Pixar movie—after Sully and his friend and colleague Mike (a giant green eyeball) have reworked the Monstropolis energy grid to run on laughter instead of children’s screams.\n\nThe Bad Batch\n\nYes, Disney really is milking its Star Wars properties for all they’re worth. The Bad Batch is an animated spinoff series set in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy in the overarching timeline. It follows a group of clone soldiers with genetic defects that give them individual traits and personalities, making them well suited to taking on daring mercenary missions. All three seasons are available to stream.\n\nWandaVision\n\nThis slow-burning sitcom parody is unexpectedly compelling. For the first couple of episodes, even hardened Marvel fans will have very little idea what’s going on, as Avengers Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live out an idyllic family life in black-and-white 1950s suburbia. Quickly, it becomes clear that something is wrong in the quiet town of Westview, as the world of the show ties into the wider MCU. Olsen reprises her role in Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which picks up right after the events of WandaVision.\n\nThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\n\nAfter the surreal sitcom stylings of WandaVision, the second Marvel show to land on Disney+ covers more familiar ground. It's an action-packed thriller that follows Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) as they try to fill the void left by Captain America in the months after the events of Avengers: Endgame.\n\nStar Wars Rebels\n\nAccessible for kids and adults alike—and undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars TV series on Disney+—this animated series follows a group of rebels led by the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and featuring his force-sensitive Padawan, Ezra Bridger (Ezra Gray). Fan favorite Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) is another regular character across its four seasons, which do a neat job of fleshing out the time between the end of the prequel trilogy and the beginning of the original one.\n\nThe Simpsons\n\nHave you got some time on your hands? Well, the 36 seasons of The Simpsons currently streaming on Disney+ should keep you busy. What can be said about one of the longest-running—and arguably most famous—animated TV shows ever made? While the first season is a little patchy by today’s standards, and there are ongoing arguments about when the show went from essential viewing to neglected cash cow, whatever your view, there are literally weeks worth of entertainment here.\n\nX-Men: The Animated Series\n\nIf you really want to nerd out, this critically acclaimed animated X-Men series from the ’90s is worth a watch. In fact, the first two films in the live-action movie franchise drew heavily from this cartoon, which serves as a nice reminder of what can be done with rich source material.\n\nMarvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nThis seven-season series, which is for serious Marvel fans, revolves around S.H.I.E.L.D.’s less super agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). The first season takes a while to warm up, but it really hits its stride in its second and especially third seasons, and it eventually ramps up with a complex plot that ties into the films.\n\nAgent Carter\n\nAgent Carter is a better show than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it struggled to find an audience during its two seasons. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Peggy Carter from several MCU films in this 1940s-set series, where she doubles as an agent for the US government while helping Howard Stark (Tony’s dad) out of more than one jam. The two seasons stretch to only 18 episodes, so it’s a quick watch, but one worth making the time for.\n\nStar Wars: The Clone Wars\n\nThis is another Star Wars animated show worth seeking out, though it’s not to be confused with the equally worthy 2003 animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars from legendary Samurai Jack creator Genndy Tartakovsky. Both series deal with the period between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith and chronicle the rise of Anakin Skywalker from arrogant Padawan to powerful Jedi Master.\n\nInside Pixar\n\nThere’s a lot of behind-the-scenes content on Disney+. These are short clips that, in another age, would have been confined to the DVD extras menu. But this series of 20-minute documentaries on different Pixar movies offers a fascinating insight into the animated hit machine.\n\nWhat If …?\n\nHere’s an animated series based on one simple question: What if? The Watcher, played by Jeffrey Wright, is an extraterrestrial being who observes the multiverse, occasionally making minor changes to influence events. This series looks at how events in the Marvel movies would have turned out differently if they’d had a Sliding Doors moment. The first episode follows an alternate timeline in which Steve Rogers remains a scrawny sidekick and Agent Carter becomes a Union Jack-draped super soldier. Actors from the films reprise their roles, including Josh Brolin as Thanos, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Karen Gillan as Nebula.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"right\", \"star\", \"tv\", \"animated\", \"marvel\", \"series\", \"55\", \"best\", \"season\", \"shows\", \"disney\", \"wars\", \"seasons\"]", "content_hash": "29ff78d5c90083b06a86284a99886da30ddc18b2bcce60dd757f6e8196c2c61f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:41.232617+00:00"}

Learn more.\n\nBallard\n\nA spin-off from Bosch, one of Prime’s biggest hits, Ballard is another creation of crime author Michael Connelly, seeing detective Renée Ballard (Maggie Q, Designated Survivor) stepping up as head of a newly formed cold-case unit. Left with no budget and no official support, Ballard hastily assembles a team of volunteers that includes her retired former partner Thomas Laffont (John Carroll Lynch) and disillusioned former cop Zamira Parker (Courtney Taylor). They soon find that diving into forgotten cases can mean unearthing secrets powerful people want to keep buried. A blend of crime-of-the-week cases and season-long mysteries make Ballard both a cozy procedural and a riveting longer-form drama, buoyed by a fantastic cast—including Titus Welliver reprising his role as Connellyverse staple Harry Bosch.\n\nThe Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy\n\nIf about 300 seasons of Grey's Anatomy hasn't scratched your medical drama itch, then a visit to The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy might be just the treatment you need. Riffing on the hospital procedural genre and giving it a sci-fi twist, the show follows alien medics Dr. Sleech (Stephanie Hsu) and Dr. Klak (Keke Palmer) as they tackle the wildest diseases and injuries the universe can throw at them—from an anxiety-eating brain worm to a shape-shifting STI—all while navigating messy relationships and personal drama. See, just like Grey’s. Created by Russian Doll writer Cirocco Dunlap—bringing that show’s Natasha Lyonne along as the voice of occasionally invisible Nurse Tup—this Saharan-dry adult animated comedy will cure what ails you.\n\nOvercompensating\n\nBenny is so deep in the closet, he's found Narnia. And rather than using his freshman year of college as a chance to find himself, he's maintaining the illusion of heterosexuality by throwing himself into a campus life of partying, drinking, and chasing girls. The consequences, for Benny and his new best friend Carmen (Wally Beram), will be severe … but hilarious. Created by comedian Benito Skinner, who also stars as Benny, Overcompensating is a foul-mouthed and ferociously funny college comedy that's almost painfully authentic in its depiction of the fine line between self-exploration and weapons-grade cringe.\n\nMobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX\n\nPrime Video doesn't tend to pick up as much anime as rival Netflix does, but when it does, it's often something big. Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX (it's pronounced “gee-kwux,” before you ask), takes things back to the very beginning of the iconic mecha franchise and asks a simple question: What if the bad guys, the “space Nazis” of the Principality of Zeon, won a crucial war? Don't worry if you can't tell a beam saber from a core fighter though—this alternate reality focuses on brand new character Amate Yuzuriha, a high school student thrust into a world of mounting military tensions after an experimental Gundam crashes into the space colony where she lives. GQuuuuuux also marks a creative high for Gundam, with Evangelion studio Khara bringing its dynamic style of animation to the series, but beyond the phenomenally flashy visuals, this has some real emotional depth, using a science fiction lens to explore how people can find hope and fight for freedom, even in the darkest of timelines. Weekly episodes drop on Tuesdays.\n\nThe Wheel of Time\n\nThe Wheel of Time has been a bit of a slow burn, but now this fantasy series is a raging fire. The first season introduced magic weaver Moiraine (Rosamund Pike) and her quest to uncover which of five unassuming young people is destined to save or destroy the world, then the second upped the stakes—returning ancient evils while scattering the only people able to stop them. The newly dropped third season pays it off in spades, though, opening with a ferocious battle between brutal woman warriors—a genre rarity—while setting the stage for Rand al’Thor (Josha Stradowski) to seize that dangerous destiny, one way or the other. Based on Robert Jordan’s sprawling novel series—one so vast it makes Game of Thrones look concise—this visually stunning series has cemented itself as the finest fantasy show around.\n\nReacher\n\nAmazon has a way with action thrillers focused on military tough guys who answer to “Jack R.” First there was Jack Ryan, who also makes an appearance in this guide. Then there was Reacher, the sharp adaptation of Lee Child’s Jack Reacher novels, now in its third season. Alan Ritchson (Titans, Fast X) stars as the physically imposing Reacher, a former military policeman now drifting from town to town, trying to live a quiet life but unable to avoid conflict. Season one found him accused of a murder he didn't commit, before season two drew him into a vast conspiracy. The newly arrived third—based on the seventh novel, Persuader—sees him up against his biggest threat yet: Paulie, an even bigger hulk of muscle (played by 7′2″ Olivier Richters). Sure, Reacher is also working undercover for the DEA and tracking down an old enemy, but three seasons in, the show is confident enough to play to its pulpy strengths, with top-tier fight choreography and surprisingly sharp dialog helping it punch above its weight.\n\nInvincible\n\nMark Grayson inherited the incredible powers and abilities of his father, Omni-Man—only to learn dear old dad wasn't a paragon of justice but the vanguard for an alien invasion. The newly dropped third season of Invincible finds Mark not only still struggling to escape his father's shadow, guiding his younger brother to use his own burgeoning powers responsibly, but also drowning in a world of murky politics, pushed toward darker, tougher choices to keep Earth safe. A brilliantly animated adaptation of the hit Image comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, Invincible’s more mature take on superheroes allows it to do something Marvel and DC characters rarely do: grow up.\n\nThe Man in the High Castle\n\nThis adaptation of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick’s novel about a world in which the Nazis won the Second World War was one of Amazon’s first forays into original content. The world-building is stunningly done—a divided, alternate-reality 1960s America never seemed so plausible—but be warned: There might be just a touch too much present-day resonance for some viewers.\n\nThe Rig\n\nBack for its second season, sci-fi thriller The Rig finds the surviving crew of isolated North Sea oil rig Kinloch Bravo forcibly relocated to The Stac, an even more remote facility in the Arctic. While most are desperate for answers and a way home, the team’s loyalties are tested as the sinister Pictor corporation seeks to use them to unearth something ancient and powerful from the sea floor. While The Rig doesn’t even aspire to subtlety when it comes to its ecological metaphors (one character even says, “If you keep punching holes in the Earth, eventually the Earth’s going to punch back”), it’s all brilliantly shot to make use of both the claustrophobic settings and the terrifying expanses and underwater pressures of the ocean. With the material elevated by a phenomenal cast of Game of Thrones and Line of Duty veterans, including Iain Glen and Rochenda Sandall—and bolstered further by the addition of the always-watchable Alice Krige in season 2—The Rig is far more than the guilty pleasure it might otherwise be.\n\nCross\n\nAldis Hodge steps into the shoes of Washington, DC homicide detective Alex Cross in Prime's new series based on James Patterson's long-running series of crime novels. However, unlike the streamer's other thrillers Bosch and Reacher, Cross doesn't directly adapt any of Patterson's books—a risky move, but one that largely pays off, allowing this eight-episode first season to chart an unpredictable journey as Cross faces off against a twisted murderer who models each of his kills on another serial killer. Already renewed for a second season, Cross is a strong addition to Prime's roster of crime dramas.\n\nCitadel: Diana\n\nAmazon tried to make a splash with its $300 million spy thriller Citadel in 2023, but only half-succeeded. The Richard Madden- and Priyanka Chopra-starring action series was entertaining enough—and rode high on Prime Video’s most-watched lists—but didn’t exactly set the world alight. However, it did establish a sprawling shared universe, with rival organizations Citadel and Manticore engaged in a globe-spanning cold war setting the stage for international spin-offs. Citadel: Diana is the first, an Italian outing focusing on Diana (Matilda De Angelis), a woman out for revenge after her parents are killed, and drawn into the spy-fi underworld with violent results. Gorgeous location shoots, bone-crunching fight choreography, and, most importantly, a tighter focus help Diana improve on its parent series.\n\nThe Legend of Vox Machina\n\nBawdy, gory, and absolutely not for kids, The Legend of Vox Machina follows the eponymous adventurers' guild—consisting of gunslingers, druids, and the requisite horny bard—as they grow from a motley crew of usually-drunk mercenaries into unexpected heroes for the realm of Exandria. The newly arrived third season continues the team's battle against the Chroma Conclave, a horrifyingly powerful collective of dragons. It's a quest that sends them on a small diversion to Hell itself. Adapting the hit Critical Role—the livestreamed Dungeons & Dragons sessions of some of the biggest voice actors in animation and gaming—this exquisitely animated fantasy takes things in unexpected directions that keep things fresh for new or returning viewers alike. A love letter to D&D that's also unafraid to poke fun at the classic RPG, it's one of the most original adult animated shows on Prime.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\n\nTapping into The Lord of the Rings creator J. R. R. Tolkien’s sprawling history of Middle-earth, The Rings of Power is set millennia before the events of the core books (or films, which is really where the visual language of this adaptation comes from), detailing the major events of Tolkien’s Second Age. While the first season was a slow burn, dwelling on the fractious politics of the era, the second ratchets up the pace considerably. From Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) trying to prevent the ascension of Dark Lord Sauron (Charlie Vickers) to the long-awaited introduction of fan-favorite character Tom Bombadil (Rory Kinnear), the new season feels far richer and deeper than before. It remains a feast for the eyes too, with the stratospheric budget apparent in every frame, from quiet moments in luxuriant shires to cinematic battles between armies of Orcs and Elves. For sheer high fantasy spectacle, there’s little else to rival this streaming right now.\n\nBatman: Caped Crusader\n\nThe first new solo Batman animated series in a decade, Caped Crusader harkens back to Batman: The Animated Series from the 1990s, with showrunner Bruce Timm returning to the Dark Knight and Hamish Linklater voicing Bruce Wayne/Batman in an ode to the late, great Kevin Conroy. Unlike rival ‘90s revival X-Men ’97, though, this isn't a continuation but rather a wholly distinct take allowing for fresh interpretations of the iconic hero’s rogues’ gallery and allies—look out for drastically different takes on the Penguin and Harley Quinn in particular. Leaning heavily into a 1930s aesthetic that evokes Batman’s earliest comic book origins, this manages to be nostalgic and provocative at once—a fantastic outing that takes DC's original urban vigilante back to his gritty pulp noir roots.\n\nThe Boys\n\nSuperheroes are meant to represent hope and optimism—the best of us, given outsize form. In The Boys, adapted from the darkly satirical comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, they’re a reflection of humanity’s worst—greed and unrestrained power, marketed to a gullible public by vested corporate interests, operating without restraint and leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his associates The Boys, gleefully dispatching “Supes” who’ve gone too far, often in extraordinarily violent ways. Unfortunately, the newly dropped fourth season finds the team in disarray, fractured by Butcher’s own lies, right as the world needs them most. Arch-manipulator Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is close to the Oval Office, while the sadistic, psychotic Homelander (Antony Starr) is planning a superhuman uprising. Probably Amazon’s goriest show, The Boys stands as a pertinent examination of the abuses of power, all wrapped in superhero drag.\n\nFallout\n\nMaybe the end of the world is the secret sauce to making a great video game adaptation—between The Last of Us and now this spectacular interpretation of Bethesda's postapocalyptic RPG series, we're living in an unexpected golden era for the form. Yet unlike HBO's bleak but beautiful world, Fallout taps into the source material to craft an apocalypse with a very different feel, one dripping in cracked Americana, black comedy, razor-sharp social satire, and just a little bit of camp. Its greatest strength, though, lies in how it doesn’t directly adapt any one of the core Fallout games. Instead, it perfectly channels their tone and feel, focusing on a core trio—naive Lucy (Ella Purnell), born and raised in a subterranean vault; driven Maximus (Aaron Moten), a recruit in an army seeking technology from the old world; and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a centuries-old bounty hunter mutated into a nigh-immortal zombie when the bombs fell—to showcase just how brilliantly twisted this nuclear wasteland really is.\n\nThree-Body\n\nNo, you're not on the Netflix list—Prime Video has its own distinct adaptation of Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem. This take, originally released for Chinese audiences back in 2023, faithfully adapts Liu's award-winning novel of humanity's first contact with an almost unknowable alien species and the impact that their impending arrival on Earth has on humanity. Hopping between time periods, a galactic mystery unfurls after nanotech specialist Wang Miao (Luyi Zhang) is called in by detective Shi Qiang (Hewei Yu) to investigate a global spate of suicides among scientists, with the ominous phrase \"Physics doesn't exist\" being the only link between the deaths. Although Three-Body is a bit softer than Netflix's 3 Body Problem when dealing with some aspects of the story—notably anything related to China's Cultural Revolution—a hearty 30-episode run allows for far more space to explore Liu's complex themes and vast roster of characters. The pacing may take some getting used to for viewers more accustomed to western TV, and it's subtitled-only, but this C-drama is out of this world.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Smith\n\nYou likely know the concept from the name alone—a married couple operate as undercover agents, blurring the lines between their personal and professional relationship. Unlike the 2005 Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie, though, 2024's Mr. and Mrs. Smith does far more with the concept. Donald Glover (who cocreated this reboot) and Maya Erskine offer much more developed takes on the mysterious characters of “John” and “Jane” Smith over the course of this eight-episode series, exploring their true identities, why they signed up for their dangerous careers, and whether their growing feelings for each other are just part of the roles they're playing. It's all backed up with plenty of Mission: Impossible–style action, of course, but it’s the sparkling chemistry between the show's leads that will leave you thinking, “Brangelina who?”\n\nGen V\n\nSpinning out of Amazon's hit The Boys, Gen V follows the next generation of supes, training their abilities at the Godolkin University School of Crimefighting. In keeping with its twisted parent show, this educational establishment is less Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and more The Hunger Games with superpowers, as students battle for glory and a chance to join premier super-team The Seven. Lead Jaz Sinclair (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) impresses as freshman Marie Moreau, a haemokinetic with lofty ambitions who uncovers dark secrets at the college that challenge her entire world view. Factor in all the poor life choices college students are famed for and some extremely creative (if often disgusting) superpowers, then allow for The Boys' trademark ultraviolence, and one thing's for sure—the kids of Gen V are most definitely not alright.\n\nJack Ryan\n\nThere's no shortage of screen adaptations of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but John Krasinski's turn as the CIA desk jockey turned field agent gets far more room to breathe than its predecessors. The prestige political thriller charts Ryan's rise from analyst to operative—and beyond—over four perfectly crafted seasons. The final season caps Ryan's career with his biggest challenge yet, investigating the convergence of a drug cartel and a terrorist organization set to create an unstoppable criminal enterprise, all while juggling the CIA's possible involvement in a political assassination in Nigeria. While the show hasn't been without controversies—season two attracted condemnation from Venezuela's government for supposedly condoning a US invasion of the country; big yikes there—its sharp writing, incredible performances, and cinematic action make it compelling viewing.\n\nI'm a Virgo\n\nA surrealist comedy with the sharp political and social edge viewers have come to expect from creator and director Boots Riley (Sorry to Bother You), I’m a Virgo follows Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a regular 19-year-old who just happens to be 13 feet tall. Raised in secrecy by Aunt Lafrancine (Carmen Ejogo) and Uncle Martisse (Mike Epps), Cootie is thrust into the limelight when his larger-than-life existence is inevitably discovered. Experiencing friendships and the outside world for the first time, gentle giant Cootie has to navigate everything from romance to the public’s reaction to a giant Black man wandering around Oakland. Oh, and did we mention Cootie’s idol, The Hero, a real-life superhero with an authoritarian streak that would put some of the worst offenders on The Boys to shame? Told you this was surreal. Do yourself a favor and watch the behind-the-scenes episodes too, tucked under Prime Video’s “Explore” tab, for Riley’s insight into each episode.\n\nTales From the Loop\n\nDespite being a couple of years old, Tales From the Loop remains one of the most mesmerizing shows on Prime Video. Loosely based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, the series blurs the line between ongoing narrative and anthology as it follows the residents of Mercer, Ohio, exploring how their intersecting lives are impacted by “the Loop,” an underground facility exploring experimental physics and making the impossible possible. Expect tales of frozen time, traded lives, and parallel worlds, all brought to life by a fantastic cast and directors—including Andrew Stanton and Jodie Foster. But it’s the visuals that really elevate this show, which captures the sublime aesthetic of Stålenhag’s work and juxtaposes neofuturism and rural communities for a world that looks and feels like almost nothing else. At only eight episodes, a visit to Mercer is brief but unforgettable.\n\nThe Underground Railroad\n\nBased on the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel by Colson Whitehead, this limited series from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins sticks pretty closely to the premise of the book. It’s a work of historical fiction that takes the idea of the Underground Railroad—the network of smugglers who helped escaped slaves flee the South—and reimagines it as an actual subway system with trains and secretive station agents.\n\nThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nWhat is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition. Rachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in this subtle nod to Joan Rivers’ career.

I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, we're bringing you five stories that you need to know about this week. And later we'll dive into our main topic, which is about how OpenAI just announced a massive partnership with the US government to make its models available to federal employees. I'm joined today by WIRED senior writer Jake Lahut. Jake, welcome to Uncanny Valley.\n\nJake Lahut: Hey Zoë. Good to be back.\n\nZoë Schiffer: OK, so our first story is actually from your newsletter Inner Loop, and it's yet another Jeffrey Epstein saga. It just won't quit. So sources have been telling you that the damage done by the Jeffrey Epstein saga is just not going to go away anytime soon. As listeners may know, conspiracy theories around Epstein's death received a lot of fresh fuel in recent weeks when the DOJ released what they called raw footage from the night of his death, but then WIRED analyzed the video and found that it had been modified after all. These conspiracy theories have been at the core of the MAGA base for years now, and you wrote really smartly about how sources say there's simply nothing that can be done to salvage the ongoing catastrophe that is the MAGA base fraying over the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein. So tell us more.

Actually not. But last fall I went to an event for Worldcoin, which is Sam Altman's other company. It was a super weird vibey crypto eye-scanning thing at a warehouse in the Mission District of San Francisco.\n\nMichael Calore: The orb?\n\nLauren Goode: This party had everything. Yeah. But there was swag there and there was a really nice sweatshirt that had World emblazoned on it, and I looked at the label and it's by a company called Original Favorites, and so I ordered one. So I have the Sam Altman Worldcoin sweatshirt without the World logo on it. I'm showing it to you right now.\n\nMichael Calore: Yeah. This is what you're wearing.\n\nLauren Goode: And I love this sweatshirt. It is like in the '90s when you used to buy sweatshirts and they were so rough and tough, they almost felt like cardboard?\n\nMichael Calore: Yes.\n\nLauren Goode: Like good old Champion sweatshirts, you know what I mean?\n\nMichael Calore: Yes.\n\nLauren Goode: That feeling. And you'd wash it a hundred times and it would still have that ... This is what this is.\n\nMichael Calore: It looks fabulous.\n\nLauren Goode: Thank you.\n\nMichael Calore: Congratulations.\n\nLauren Goode: Mike, what's your recommendation?\n\nMichael Calore: Oh, gosh. I'm going to recommend some stand-up comedy for our times.\n\nLauren Goode: Do it.\n\nMichael Calore: It's the new Marc Maron stand-up special that's on HBO. It came out a week ago or so. It's called Panicked and it is quite good. In particular, I'm recommending it because there's a fantastic riff, like right in the middle, a whole bit about the app Watch Duty, which is the app that people use to track wildfires and became very popular in Los Angeles at the beginning of 2025 when LA was devastated by all of the wildfires. Well, Marc tells the story about how he had Watch Duty and he could not understand the notifications in the app, and he didn't know whether or not he should evacuate, so he grabbed all of his cats and evacuated and just absolutely did not need to. And it's this really fun long story, but it's also just very good. The whole thing is very good. If you're familiar with Marc Maron's comedy, you'll know that he's very dark and this special does get very dark, particularly in the second half, but I can highly recommend it. If you know him and you like him, you will love it.\n\nLauren Goode: Adding it to the watch list.\n\nMichael Calore: Great.\n\nLauren Goode: Adding it to Watch Duty. Our guy, Boone Ashworth, who used to produce this show for us, he wrote a feature story this year about Watch Duty, too.\n\nMichael Calore: He did. He did.\n\nLauren Goode: So we'll include that in the show notes.\n\nMichael Calore: Yes.\n\nLauren Goode: And Mike, you're never leaving us again, right? No more vacations for you ever?\n\nMichael Calore: Never ever.\n\nLauren Goode: Thank God.\n\nMichael Calore: I'll be sitting here behind the microphone until the end of time.\n\nLauren Goode: The best chatbot there is.\n\nMichael Calore: Thanks for listening to Uncanny Valley.

This is an evacuation, no? I find this sad in a lot of ways just because I remember when Tuvalu was kind of the poster child for climate change, and it was like, we have to save places like this island nation, and it just sort of feels like, I think practical and understandable and humane, but also, I don't know, an indication that we're giving up and that there's sort of defeat of we're actually just going to move people. I don't know. What do you think?\n\nZoë Schiffer: No, I mean, I completely agree. I also remember this story evolving over time, and it feels like with so many things with climate change will have the big headline, \"We have to do X by this year or this other thing will happen.\" And we've just again and again and again been like, “OK, that didn't happen.\" And so we're accepting that floods are going to happen, or rising sea levels are going to damage this area or whatever and now we're on to dealing with the fallout from that.\n\nLouise Matsakis: Yeah, and even in this case, I think the agreement that Tuvalu has with Australia is less than 300 people can move a year and be evacuated as I'm going to keep using that word. And that's still not that many. There's still going to be people on this island as the seas rise.\n\nZoë Schiffer: I mean, yeah, it's not the only thing that Tuvalu has done since 2022. The country has been trying to undergo this ambitious strategy to become the world's quote, unquote, \"first digital nation\", which included 3D scanning of the islands to digitally recreate them and preserve parts of the culture and moving government functions to a virtual environment, which makes sense. But yeah, I mean, I think the reality is a lot is going to be lost in this process. And like you said, the number of people that they're able to move every year is less than 300, so it's going to be slow, and I think painful in some ways.\n\nLouise Matsakis: Totally.\n\nZoë Schiffer: Coming up after the break, we dive into Louisa's story on how ChatGPT's tendency to ignore the context of the information it absorbs is showing up in extremely weird ways. Stay with us. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer. I'm joined today by WIRED's Louise Matsakis, who recently reported on how a lack of context is becoming an increasingly alarming problem for ChatGPT and other chatbots. Louisa's reporting explores why ChatGPT went into demon mode when it was speaking with Atlantic staffers recently. Last week, an editor at the Atlantic reported that ChatGPT started praising Satan and encouraging ceremonies that involved various forms of self-mutilation. So Louise, what the hell is going on?\n\nLouise Matsakis: So the Atlantic reported this story that basically made the case that know ChatGPT has these safeguards against things like self-harm, but there's all these edge cases that suddenly send the chatbot into kind of a role-playing mode. And so they were like, \"Hey, can you make a ritual for Molech, which is this ancient God that shows up in the Bible that's associated with child sacrifice?\" And ChatGPT saw that word and immediately went into this role-playing game where it started talking about things like deep magic experience called the Gate of the Devourer. It asked the Atlantic journalists if they wanted something called a reverent bleeding scroll. And so all that sounds like really bizarre, and you might think like, oh, there's a lot of content on the internet about demonic rituals. Satanists are everywhere, especially online. That's probably what's going on here. But when I looked into it, all of this lore and jargon actually comes from a game called 40,000 Warhammer, which is this tabletop war playing game that you play with these little figurines, and it's been around since the 1980s. People who love this stuff love it. And they are online, the Reddits are popping off all days of the week. There's so many science fiction books, there's so many... I honestly struggle to think of deeper lores than this game. And as a result, ChatGPT ingested all that information. And when the Atlantic used the word Molech, which is a planet in the universe of this game, it immediately just sort of assumed that this was another Warhammer fan who wanted to go into role-playing or get into the fantasy world of this game.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"atlantic\", \"game\", \"matsakis\", \"chatgpt\", \"going\", \"schiffer\", \"goes\", \"demon\", \"roundup\", \"word\", \"yeah\", \"think\", \"mode\", \"wired\", \"theres\"]", "content_hash": "57d967e473bdcd7467e0fa5641dfcc6cea27c6eb4a2954e41451fcd39a470b36", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:44.621450+00:00"}
{"url": "https://www.wired.com/story/the-fort-bragg-cartel-seth-harp-excerpt/", "title": "The Rise of the US Military’s Clandestine Foreign War Apparatus", "authors": "[\"Seth Harp\", \"Steven Levy\", \"Matthew Gault\", \"Will Knight\", \"Elizabeth Chappell\", \"Kylie Robison\", \"Guthrie Scrimgeour\", \"Tess Owen\", \"Zoë Schiffer\", \"Megan Farokhmanesh\"]", "published": "2025-08-12T11:00:00+00:00", "text": "The 2020s are shaping up to be one of the most violent decades in modern history, with American-sponsored proxy conflicts and shadow wars smoldering all over the world, from Ukraine to Yemen to Gaza. The United States enables and prolongs these wars not by sending troops to fight in them, but by trafficking arms to the belligerents, providing intelligence to its favored proxies, and using covert operations, especially assassinations, to shape geopolitical conditions. At the forefront of these clandestine US military machinations is the Fort Bragg-based Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, which despite its relative invisibility to the public is far and away the most powerful organization in the military, and one of the most influential institutions in the US government. But it was not always this way.\n\nAs I discuss in my new book, The Fort Bragg Cartel, the rise of JSOC does not date back to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or the wars that the United States waged in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Twin Towers. Rather, the origins of JSOC’s takeover from within are traceable to the darkest days of the Iraq War, about five years after 9/11, when things were going considerably worse for American war planners and foreign policy officials, and—in a backlash that would lead to the election of President Barack Obama—the public was turning sharply against US involvement in foreign wars.\n\nThis excerpt tells part of that story.\n\nOn just one day in June 2006, the Associated Press reported that shootings and bombings killed 12 people in Baghdad, a suicide bomber killed four and wounded 27 at the funeral of a Shiite soldier, seven bullet-riddled bodies were pulled from the Tigris River, two who had been tortured to death were fished out of the Euphrates, and police found the body of a teenage girl who had been raped and murdered in Kirkuk. Amid this horrible paroxysm of revenge killings, auguring Iraq’s descent into outright civil war split along sectarian lines, President George W. Bush and his national security council pulled together a host of new advisors in an attempt to revise their failing strategy. It was at this juncture that a number of ambitious officials in the special operations community stepped up to offer a new path forward. The plan of action that they developed, which Bush’s successor would adopt and expand in Afghanistan, forever transformed the American way of making war, and goes a long way toward explaining how Fort Bragg, North Carolina, even more than the CIA’s headquarters at Langley, Virginia, came to be the United States’ national nerve center of invisible imperial power.\n\nBuy This Book At:\n\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

McChrystal, a West Point graduate and the son of a distinguished general, had risen through the ranks in the 75th Ranger Regiment and was groomed for some of the Army’s most sensitive missions. Smart, shrewd, charismatic, and press-savvy, McChrystal first came to prominence as a Pentagon spokesman, and in 2003, was tapped to lead black ops JSOC, which until then had been relegated to important but limited roles. Consistent with the emphasis laid on psychological operations in the Special Forces, the most important warfighting innovation that McChrystal developed while serving in this position was not primarily tactical or strategic but ideological and mediatic.\n\nAlthough there were relatively few foreign fighters in Iraq and most came from neighboring Syria, McChrystal was the primary proponent of the view, quick to spread among Washington policymakers, that the enemy was not a nationalist rebellion against outside occupation, but one node of a global conspiracy of America-hating terrorists. To describe this nebulous and inherently malignant foe, McChrystal and his staff invented the term “al-Qaeda in Iraq” or AQI. At the top of this dubious organization, which they themselves had done more than anyone else to conjure into being, JSOC analysts placed the dopey Jordanian criminal Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a mysterious Bedouin bogeyman, much hyped by deceitful Pentagon spooks in the runup to the war, who may not have even been in Iraq at the time. To explain away the paucity of tangible contacts between insurgents in Iraq and Osama bin Laden’s organization, the remnants of which were now scattered around Pakistan and Yemen, McChrystal and his aides redefined al-Qaeda as a concentric grouping of decentralized “franchises” operating on a “blind cell model.”\n\nIn his memoir, McChrystal admits with remarkable if belated frankness that JSOC produced intelligence assessments “that inflated al-Qaeda’s role,” and “problematically used ‘AQI’ as a catchall designation for any Sunni group that attacked Americans.” This narrative, he acknowledges, was a way to “sidestep the reality” that most Iraqi insurgents were primarily motivated by “earthly grievances,” not Islamist ideology. There’s no indication, however, that he shared these important caveats with President Bush, who seized upon the imaginary influx of foreign jihadists into Iraq as an after-the-fact vindication of his discredited case for war. By grossly exaggerating Zarqawi’s importance, McChrystal and his deputy, Vice Admiral William McRaven, convinced the Bush administration that it was possible for the United States to kill its way to victory in Iraq through a massively stepped-up campaign of targeted assassinations. This was an essential precondition for the rise of JSOC.\n\nAnother of the advisors whom Bush called upon to reformulate the war effort in late 2006 was Michael Vickers, the top Pentagon official in charge of the larger umbrella organization over JSOC, the Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, known by the comically unwieldy acronym “ASD SO/LIC & IC,” for Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict and Interdependent Capabilities. In his memoir, Vickers recalls how the Bush administration scrapped its existing playbook and instituted a new policy that put JSOC firmly in charge of the fight in Iraq.\n\nThe plan involved a two-pronged approach, the public-facing aspect of which was a temporary buildup or “surge” of conventional forces. But the real escalation took place behind the scenes, as JSOC was quietly tasked with implementing a radically expanded campaign of mass assassinations very similar to the Vietnam-era Phoenix Program, which in spite of the repugnance it had elicited in the public, was considered a success by the Washington-dwelling national-security set. Once limited to former regime officials and leaders of the insurgency, JSOC’s hit list, euphemistically known as the “disposition matrix” or “joint prioritized effects list,” grew exponentially to include anyone, however youthful or peripheral, suspected of taking up arms against American occupiers. Vickers calls this covert war the “hidden surge.”\n\nFrom now on, Iraq would be a war of targeted killings carried out clandestinely, almost always at night. Swollen with new infusions of money, personnel, equipment, and aircraft, JSOC became “JSOC on steroids,” a “counterterrorism killing machine” capable of slaying recalcitrant Iraqis on a scale that both Vickers and McChrystal describe as “industrial.” From about 10 a month at the start of the war, the number of night raids that JSOC carried out increased to 10 per day at the height of the surge.\n\nMcChrystal called this relentless tempo the “continuous targeting cycle.” Fluent in McKinsey-style jargon like “decision cycle,” “dynamic process,” and “nodal analysis,” he was adept at spitting out pithy truisms such as “it takes a network to defeat a network,” and a prolific coiner of acronyms like F3EAD, which stood for Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, and Disseminate.\n\nDespite the ungainly initialism, the F3EAD cycle was not a complicated concept. It typically meant tracking down a target, killing him and every adult man and teenage boy in the vicinity, seizing every piece of paper and electronic device found on their persons, and using these materials to come up with more names to add to the hit list, and then killing them too, sometimes just a few hours later.\n\nThe hidden surge, in which the Army component of JSOC, known as Delta Force, played the leading role, was greatly enabled by the widespread adoption of cell phones in Iraq, a technological development that coincided with the first few years of American occupation. JSOC’s screen-filled headquarters at Camp Anaconda received an influx of personnel from the National Security Agency, who found it trivial to intercept unencrypted calls on Iraq’s burgeoning mobile networks, and could easily transform cell phones into listening devices.\n\nTelevision and film depictions of the Global War on Terrorism often portray American operators and spies as able to speak the local languages, suavely lobbing savvy quotations from the Koran at their truculent Islamist antagonists. But in a startling admission with sobering implications, McChrystal states in his memoir that JSOC in Iraq was “hindered by an almost complete lack of Arabic skills within our force,” suggesting that nearly all of those whom Delta Force killed were targeted not on the basis of the content of telephonic intercepts, but on pseudoscientific “nodal analysis,” tips from paid informants, and arbitrary guesswork.\n\n“We were not death squads,” McChrystal writes. But armed with NSA intercepts, backed by newly developed Reaper drones, and joined by fierce Kurdish mercenaries called Mohawks, that’s exactly what JSOC became during the covert surge in Iraq, which lasted into 2008. The body count from Delta Force’s killing spree, and the proportion of Iraq’s hundreds of thousands of war dead who were gunned down in JSOC night raids, will never be known because it wasn’t recorded in the first place. That these events are lost to the historical and photographic record was by design. What Vickers dubs the “hidden surge” was a side of the Iraq war never intended to be seen by the public, who were fed images of conventional, uniformed troops on patrol, but never any footage of the plainclothes men who did nearly all of the nighttime wet work.\n\n“From 2006 on, 90 percent or higher of insurgent deaths were from targeted, offensive SOF operations,” said a former Delta Force sergeant major who served in Iraq during the surge, using an acronym that refers to special operations forces in general. “Going out night after night, on purpose, and getting in firefights with bad guys—that job fell to us.”\n\nInstead of mounting patrols and reacting to fire like conventional infantry, Delta Force operators identified their targets from a distance, in advance, and took them by surprise, often making use of perfidious techniques such as disguising themselves as Iraqis, using wigs, brownface, and prosthetics. They posed as Red Cross personnel, United Nations inspectors, western businessmen, or European diplomats. With the help of female support soldiers, they passed themselves off as husband-and-wife pairs, masquerading, for instance, as married schoolteachers who’d come to teach English to Iraqi kids. They even copied the enemy’s tactics and blew up targets with roadside bombs.\n\nAmong themselves, the bearded, long-haired operators called each other by their first names, eschewed divisions of rank, and dressed in a mishmash of civilian attire. When they did wear uniforms, the unit patches they sported were purely fictitious: hometown police badges, the seals of various states, Spartan helmets, Crusader shields, the Confederate battle flag, or jokey tabs that said things like “HATCHET FORCE” or “FUCK AL QAEDA.”\n\nNo camera crews ever went on night raids with Delta Force. Their operations were not the subject of news documentaries, nor do we possess any oral histories, because silence is the unit’s chief point of pride. But over time, these strictures inevitably loosen, if only a little. In recent years, many former special operators have gone on podcasts to discuss their military careers in a certain Army “special mission unit” or “compartmented element.” And once-rare photos of JSOC operations have found their way onto social media, including images of Delta Force in Iraq under McCrystal’s leadership.\n\n“Several of my rotations to Iraq [were] composed of just my team and a small HQ element,” a former Delta Force troop sergeant major named Jesse Boettcher wrote in an Instagram post dated February 28, 2022. “While I had the full force of the US government just a radio call away, there were very few of us on the ground getting dirty. Our small element was able to execute and refine the entire F3EAD cycle almost daily, with very little outside assistance.”\n\nIn the photo accompanying the post, Boettcher, then in his mid-thirties, sits at a table dressed in soiled civilian clothes. In back of him is a whiteboard. Much of the writing on it has been blacked out, but you can still read random words, including “meeting,” “explosives,” “liaison,” “interrogation,” and “safehouse.” Taped on the wall behind the whiteboard is a grid of 55 mugshots of brown-skinned men. Almost all of them have been crossed out with an X.\n\nAnother picture, posted January 19, 2022, shows the rest of Boettcher’s team, a group of seven unkempt white men. “It might look like a ragtag bunch of ruffians, but this crew were straight-up Pipe-Hitters,” Boettcher wrote, using an obscure term considered a high compliment in the special operations community that derives from the concept of a soldier who is so fearless, daring, and addicted to war that he can be likened to a smoker of crack cocaine. “The guys in front,” Boettcher wrote, referring to three fresh-faced, clean-shaven young men kneeling in the foreground, “have killed more people than cancer.”\n\nExcerpt adapted from The Fort Bragg Cartel: Drug Trafficking and Murder in the Special Forces by Seth Harp.

Her company's chips underpin the artificial intelligence that’s changing the world at breakneck speeds. To hear Su and literally everyone else in semiconductors talk about it, the US is in an AI race with China—and the rules keep changing. The Trump administration has once again shifted its stance on what kind of chips can and can’t be shipped to China, with the latest decree being that the US will take a 15 percent cut of AMD and Nvidia chip sales to China. Meanwhile, on the home front, Su has claimed that AMD’s newest AI chips can outperform Nvidia’s—part of her strategy to keep eroding Nvidia’s dominance in the market.\n\nSo, yeah: Be ready to keep up.\n\nUnder Lisa Su, the stalwart American semiconductor company has reasserted itself as a force in the age of AI. “Reasserted” doesn’t do it justice: Su took a struggling AMD and executed a 10-year turnaround that has been, as one economist put it, nothing short of remarkable. Since 2014, when Su took over as CEO, AMD’s market cap has risen from around $2 billion to nearly $300 billion.\n\nAside from her well-known bona fides, Su herself—what drives her, what inspires her, what irritates her, where her politics lie—is less known. This is what I was hoping to learn when I visited AMD’s offices and labs in the hills of Austin, Texas, on a day in late June when the wind seemed to do little more than push heat around.\n\nThe Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.\n\nOur conversation kicked off with China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of AMD’s business. She betrayed no anxiety. Su now travels frequently to Washington, DC, to grease the wheels. “We’ve come to realize that export controls are a bit of a fact of life,” she told me, “just given how critical the chips that we make are.” In other words, it’s precisely because AMD’s chips are so darn important—to national security, to national economies—that they’re now at the heart of modern statecraft.\n\nAnother thing I learned about Su: She plays the long game. Politics is a cakewalk compared to what she’s managed to pull off professionally.\n\nSu was born in Taiwan in 1969 and raised in Queens, New York. Her father worked for the city as a statistician; her mother was an accountant who became an entrepreneur in her mid-forties. Su earned a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from MIT, then went on to stints at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor, where she served in executive roles. After joining AMD in 2012, she quickly rose to COO. As Su tells it, six months in, the chairman of the board called her and said, “It’s time, Lisa.” Su’s response: “Really? That seems kinda quick.”\n\nAs CEO, Su smartly steered AMD toward the high-performance computing market. She embraced chiplets, a modular approach to building chips that has paid off enormously. She impressed the industry by launching the world’s first 7-nanometer data center GPUs. More recently, she doubled AMD’s data center revenue in two years. And she has struck deals with juggernauts like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and a couple of Elon Musk’s companies. During a keynote speech at AMD’s annual event this June, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman trotted onto the stage to hug it out with Su.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"ceo\", \"chips\", \"runs\", \"china\", \"took\", \"amdand\", \"su\", \"lisa\", \"nvidias\", \"amd\", \"thats\", \"amds\", \"ai\", \"blood\"]", "content_hash": "5cded454b491759e5b55e8be644888408ecbaa4a734162a0efe6246ebe236786", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:46.264066+00:00"}

After decades of clinical research, political wrangling, and aggressive promotion, the popular underground club drug was set to be tamed and medicalized, with a stamp of approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Then, it wasn’t.\n\nIn a stark change of course, the FDA rejected the MDMA therapy it had been considering by a 10-1 vote. The decision derailed psychedelic medicine for the foreseeable future.\n\nExcept for one thing—an unexpected lifeline from the Trump administration. In May, the FDA’s new commissioner, surgical oncologist Marty Makary, appeared on cable news to declare MDMA and other Schedule 1 narcotics “a top priority for this FDA and this administration.” Elsewhere, Mr. MAHA himself, the US Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has spoken positively about the psychoactive stems-and-bark tea ayahuasca. Matt Zorn, a lawyer recently appointed to RFK Jr.’s department, had previously fought the US government to allow access to cannabis and psychedelic mushrooms. Casey Means, Trump’s nominee for surgeon general, has spoken of the benefits of psilocybin-assisted therapy, claiming that psychedelic mushrooms helped her find love and made her feel like “part of an infinite and unbroken series of cosmic nesting dolls.”\n\nPsychedelic medicine, as it turns out, slots rather comfortably into the burn-it-all ethos of RFK Jr.’s movement. But as MDMA’s advocates regroup to take advantage of this surge of support, they’re also reckoning with why they failed to win over the FDA—and whether a second attempt could go better. Could the psychedelic world’s new Trumpworld allies be the ones who finally help it achieve its goal?\n\nPhotograph: Tonje Thilesen\n\nFor almost half a century, American psychedelic medicine—and MDMA in particular—has had one indispensable advocate: Rick Doblin. On a cool December morning, I met Doblin at his bright purple craftsman home in the Boston suburbs. Dressed in a well-worn chamois shirt and khakis and with a wiry tangle of hair, he was cheery and avuncular.

They’re brimming with plump kiwis, hardy avocados, and ripened bananas. These are the food of the gods, I figure, for a man who aspires to live like one. But then I look closer. A lone orange, its skin flecked with mold, sits adjacent to two lemons, both almost entirely consumed by a layer of white fuzz. Something, it seems, is rotten in the estate of Johnson.\n\nBeyond Wellness The line between science and wellness has been blurred beyond recognition. WIRED is here to help.\n\nThat estate, it’s worth noting, is a predictable one. Johnson’s home in Venice, California, is the angular, concrete-floored template of a dwelling you’d assume is owned by a man. Specifically a man who worked in tech, made his millions, and subsequently embarked on a midlife, post-wealth search for purpose. All of which Johnson is, and did, and still appears to be doing: After selling his web payments company, Braintree, for $800 million in 2013, Johnson parted ways with both his wife and his lifelong Mormon religion. In 2021 he announced Project Blueprint, an effort designed to reverse his own body’s aging process. This involves an all-consuming, unproven regimen including but not limited to daily exercises, blood tests, a doctrinal sleep routine, MRIs, plasma transfers, scalp stimulants, urine tests, several dozen supplements, Dexa scans, light therapy, and caloric restriction.\n\nIf the rotting fruit didn’t give it away, then no, this is not a kitchen where household memories are made over milk and cookies—although a collage of candid photos taped above Johnson’s stove offers hints of familial warmth. (Johnson has three kids, one of whom is infamous for donating data on his youthful erections and his own plasma to his father’s anti-aging efforts.) This is a kitchen, after all, that shares a home with specimen cups of semen and coolers of Johnson’s blood; where pills and powders, which I find meticulously stocked in Johnson’s walk-in pantry, are mixed, optimized, and consumed; where food is not eaten so much as nutrition is performed.\n\nPerformance, of course, is Johnson’s specialty. There’s the performance of his body, which Johnson claims is now the single healthiest on Earth. And there’s how that body shows up to the viewing public, which it does quite often. Johnson has been the subject of dozens of profiles and interviews, as well as a Netflix documentary released earlier this year. He has amassed more than 4 million followers across YouTube, Instagram, and X, and he posts an ongoing stream of content about his sleep habits (sublime), his diet (meticulous), and his erections (trigger warning). Johnson has also used his online reach to push back against recent controversies, including a legal battle with his former fiancée Taryn Southern, and a New York Times investigation into his extensive use of confidentiality agreements to prevent, among other things, Blueprint employees from publicly talking about Johnson as well as his business dealings.\n\nOver a 90-minute conversation, Johnson spoke at length about his longevity protocol, his assessment of RFK Jr.’s MAHA movement, and those agreements that he continues to enforce. He also took great pains to convince me—and all of you—that this wasn’t just about health and longevity. No, like most tech men living in boxy modernist homes and saddled with illusions of grandeur, Johnson has a new holy grail with which to galvanize his faithful following: artificial intelligence, baby.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nPHOTOGRAPH: ERICA HERNANDEZ PHOTOGRAPH: ERICA HERNANDEZ\n\nKATIE DRUMMOND: I’m going to ask you a very simple true-or-false question that you can answer however you want.

As he reclines in bed, three blue circles appear on a laptop screen a few feet away. One turns red: the target. Jackson is in control of a white circle, which he needs to steer into the target without running into the blue obstacles. The game is a bit like Pac-Man. Except instead of a joystick, Jackson uses his thoughts to control his little white circle. To move left, he thinks about clenching his right fist once. To move right, he thinks about doing it twice in a row, like a double click.\n\nBeyond Wellness The line between science and wellness has been blurred beyond recognition. WIRED is here to help.\n\nJackson, who is 65 and paralyzed, is good at this game. He steers into the red circle. It turns blue and makes a satisfying ding! He has hit the target. In the next round, the circles change position. He moves to the next round, and the next, and is successful 14 out of 15 times. He’s gotten 100 percent at this game before. Then again, he’s had some practice.\n\nA couple years ago, surgeons in Pittsburgh implanted Jackson with an experimental brain-computer interface, or BCI. Made by New York–based startup Synchron, it decodes Jackson’s brain signals to carry out commands on the laptop and other devices. He’s one of 10 people—six in the US and four in Australia—who have received the Synchron implant as part of an early feasibility study. In addition to gaming, the BCI allows him to send text messages, write emails, and shop online.\n\nJackson’s medical saga began about five years ago, when he was living in Georgia and working for a wholesale floral company—his dream job. He thought he had pinched a nerve in his neck. But in January 2021, doctors at Emory University told him the diagnosis was far more serious: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A neurodegenerative disease, ALS causes nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to break down over time, resulting in a gradual loss of muscle control. Jackson’s doctor asked if he was interested in joining a clinical trial testing an ALS drug. Jackson said it was a no-brainer.\n\nJackson in his first-floor bedroom. PHOTOGRAPH: STEPHANIE STRASBURG Before his ALS diagnosis, Jackson had taken up woodworking. PHOTOGRAPH: STEPHANIE STRASBURG\n\nBut by December 2022, he had lost the ability to type or lift buckets of flowers at his job and had to stop working. He moved in with his brother just outside Pittsburgh. “The loss of mobility, the loss of independence that goes with this disease,” Jackson says, “it’s a lot to take in, it’s a lot to process.” He tried to stay positive even as his disease progressed. When the drug trial ended in summer 2023, he was eager to join another study that had a chance of helping his ALS.\n\nSynchron’s BCI trial was just getting underway at the University of Pittsburgh. While the implant wouldn’t slow the progression of Jackson’s ALS, it could give him back some of the autonomy he’d lost to the disease. “I was immediately excited about it,” Jackson says.\n\nHe started the vetting process in July 2023, and six weeks later Jackson was in the operating room. In a roughly three-hour-long procedure, surgeons first inserted the Stentrode, a wire-mesh tube about the size of a matchstick, into his jugular vein at the base of his neck. Using a catheter, they carefully threaded the device up through the vessel, past the ear, and into the side of the head to rest against the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement. Then they inserted a small rectangular device below Jackson’s collarbone, which processes the brain signals and beams them via infrared outside the body. Those signals are collected by a paddle-shaped receiver that sits on Jackson’s chest, then sent via a wire to a unit that translates them into commands.

He was holding a radio. “Oh, shit,” Farmer thought, figuring the border police had sent word up the road. He put his head down. All Ward could make out were heated words between the taxi driver and the stranger. “What’s going on?” he asked. “Shut up,” Farmer said, “I’m trying to listen.” Karl was completely still in the back seat, wondering how he’d gotten himself into this situation. The yelling stopped and the car started moving again. “Turned out that was a politician trying to commandeer this taxi,” Farmer explained to Ward and Karl. “He had no idea who we were.”\n\nThey carried on along the road and eventually reached a border crossing on the shore of Lake Titicaca, where they stepped onto a ferry that would take them to Bolivia. By now the sun was rising over the Andes, bringing up the blue of the lake. Below, the water was visible through the warped deck boards of the ancient barge. The crossing takes more than an hour, and by the time they stopped at Isla del Sol, an island just inside of Bolivia, they started to feel safe.\n\nSeventeen days earlier, a massive stone had careened over this lake, a fittingly Empyrean setting for such a grand celestial appearance. Farmer, Ward, and Karl had come all this way to find a visitor from the stars, only to be confronted by a small but swift maelstrom of very terrestrial habits: fear and anger, hope and disappointment, opportunism and greed. Farmer had been at such pains to reassure everyone else that the rock was not dangerous, but in the end it had summoned enough danger to force him and his partners to flee.\n\nThe Aymara pray to their gods at this lake. In the distance was Amantani, an island where Pachamama receives offerings for a bountiful harvest. The meteorite hunters might not talk about it this way, but they too were here to find fortune from the sky. And for a brief moment they thought they’d found it. Feast or famine from above, the enduring human tradition.\n\nIn a way, the hunters’ obsession is almost mystical itself, imbuing their rocks with an aura built on belief. Both science and superstition attributed something special to the meteorite, and therein resided its spiritual or material worth. Its value was an expression of faith. Even at their deepest rationalist moments, the meteorite hunters are hoping for life to be changed by celestial intervention.\n\nThey were here to find fortune falling from the sky. Feast or famine from above, the enduring human tradition.\n\nThe group arrived on the Bolivian shore in a small town that they were surprised to discover was called Copacabana. “Quite unlike the one in Rio,” Farmer said. His joke was greeted with silence. They headed for La Paz, where they checked into their hotel and found an email from the vice consul to the US embassy in Lima. It turned out the US authorities thought the trio had been arrested, and Peruvian news was claiming that they were already in custody there. Farmer assured the consul they were not, in fact, in jail; they had evaded capture and were heading back to the United States.\n\nIt wasn’t until Farmer got to Miami that he reached Melody, who was glad to hear from him, even if they were coming home practically empty-handed. After all, they had not made the career-­defining recovery they imagined. They lamented what was lost. But if the desire for divine intervention is eternal, so is the wait. Everyone, in some way, is hoping that their own rock will fall from the sky—that thing which brings riches and fame or transforms failures into successes and sorrows into joy, the existential alembic that makes ordinary life extraordinary. And for all their smarts and pluck, Farmer, Ward, and Karl had just learned what we already know deep in our hearts: Destiny is not determined by the stars. The odds of that stone landing where it did were calculated at 1 in 182 trillion.

The former corporate executive from Colorado retired in 2006 after an MRI revealed his spine was riddled with a dozen tumors called hemangiomas, which later spread to his brain. Todd was told he would die before the end of 2008.\n\nSomehow, Todd has survived—he credits medical marijuana, which he now uses daily—but he is still considered terminal. “It could be tomorrow. It could be five years from now,” he says in a call.\n\nHowever, the 54-year-old spent the past decade plagued by a host of mental health problems, including PTSD and treatment-resistant depression. He was suicidal and tormented by violent night terrors. Nothing, not even massive doses of Xanax or Valium, could temper his panic attacks or end-of-life anxiety.\n\n“My mental condition was deteriorating rapidly, and I was on [antidepressant] medication No. 14 and it wasn’t working,” Todd says. “My psychiatrist said, ‘I honestly think you're a big candidate for psychedelics.’”\n\nThat was about a year ago. Todd began taking homegrown psilocybin, the highly illegal alkaloid in so-called magic mushrooms. Known for prompting profound hallucinations, psilocybin was placed in the restrictive Schedule I category in 1970, meaning the US government recognizes no medical use for the drug and says that it carries a high risk of abuse.\n\nTodd says there have been clear benefits from psilocybin with few side effects. He hasn’t had a single PTSD episode since he began taking it. His depression evaporated. The mushrooms even help ease the pain—agony that feels like being “shot in the back”—from the nerve-crushing tumors in his spine and skull.\n\n“It’s knocked that out, it’s wiped that slate clean,” Todd says. The day before we talked, he’d eaten eight grams of fungus. A heavy dose is considered five grams, so this was no psychedelic snack—but Todd ingests this much about every week.\n\nThe experience is positively hypnagogic, allowing trippers to enter a dreamlike conscious state where time is distorted, color is amplified, and depth perception is warped. Euphoric, unbridled laughter is common, as are oddly introspective thoughts about existence and reality, and even synesthetic sensations, such as being able to “see” sounds. A trip can last four to six hours.\n\nThere can be negative effects as well, such as nausea, dizziness, paranoia, or panic attacks, but Todd doesn’t experience those. He still takes 10 milligrams of escitalopram, an antidepressant, and when the mushrooms wear off, 30 milligrams of the opioid oxycodone, but otherwise his prescription drug intake has drastically decreased.\n\nTodd asked me not to use his real name, fearful that his health insurance provider could sever benefits because he uses illicit substances. But his doctors are aware and supportive of his psychedelic drug use, he says, which may legally exempt him under the federal Right To Try Act for terminally ill patients, signed by President Trump last May.\n\nIndeed, magic mushrooms are having a therapeutic moment. In North America, at least four organizations, each with unique strategies, are working to expand access to psilocybin for anyone with mental health issues, dying or not. These groups hope to undo decades of psilocybin prohibition by removing criminal penalties for possession or cultivation, or by providing access to psilocybin in a therapist’s offices, or both.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"legalize\", \"wasnt\", \"uses\", \"psilocybin\", \"mental\", \"ptsd\", \"depression\", \"taking\", \"push\", \"health\", \"todd\", \"magic\", \"drug\", \"mushrooms\", \"working\"]", "content_hash": "03043ba4e4d3f2d9a83f63bcef58347b3113d2999cf83ac66d50224ebe050ab5", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:50.791971+00:00"}

In it, a black dog named Lucy approaches a series of six stations, each separated by a small barrier. At every one, a glass cup of human urine with a screened lid sits at the level of the animal’s nose. Lucy takes a brief sniff of each sample, sometimes digging her snout in to get a better whiff. She is performing a kind of diagnostic test: searching for the telltale scent of prostate cancer, which, it turns out, leaves a volatile, discernible signature in a man’s pee. Discernible if you’re a dog, anyway. When Lucy finds what she’s looking for, she sits down and receives a treat.\n\nAmong humans—whose toolmaking prowess has given the world self-driving suitcases and reusable rocket boosters—prostate cancer is notoriously difficult to detect. The prevailing method is to check a patient’s blood for elevated levels of a protein called prostate-specific antigen. But the test has a miserable track record. The scientist who first discovered PSA has described the test as “hardly more effective than a coin toss.” A false positive can lead to a prostate biopsy, a harrowing procedure that involves inserting a large, hollow needle through the wall of the rectum to retrieve a tissue sample from the prostate itself.\n\nProperly trained dogs, on the other hand, can detect prostate cancer with better than 90 percent accuracy, and with sleek, tail-­wagging efficiency. In the video, Lucy works her way through six samples in just a couple of minutes. This drives Mershin up the wall. “We have $100 million worth of equipment downstairs. And the dog can beat me?” he says. “That is pissing me off.”\n\nMershin is not a doctor. He’s a physicist by training. He runs a lab called the Label Free Research Group, which exists to spite the boundaries between physics, biology, materials science, and information science. In his office, Mershin keeps a pair of sunglasses that can measure brain waves, along with magazines on aviation and books on urology, the physics of consciousness, and coding in Python. He speaks rapidly in an accent that sits somewhere between his two native languages, and he changes subjects at the slightest provocation. He refuses to wear matching socks, because why should socks match? He is short and round, with a mane of strawberry blond curls that bounce when he gets excited.\n\nMershin’s lab, where he keeps that $100 million worth of equipment, sits a few floors down from his office at MIT. In one room, researchers are trying to invent new colors; in another, to create the lightest, strongest materials on earth. But I’m here because this facility is doing some of the most important research in the world toward developing AO—artificial olfaction.\n\nPlenty of robots these days can see, hear, speak, and (crudely) think. But good luck finding one that can smell. In part, that’s simply because olfaction has always been deeply underrated by humans—a species of cerebral, hypervisual snobs. Kant dismissed smell as the “most dispensable” of our five senses.

There, he changes into swim trunks, steps out on a 3-meter springboard, looks at the water below, and dives.\n\nBrin is competent at all four types of springboard diving—forward, back, reverse, and inward. Recently, he's been working on his twists, which have been something of a struggle. But overall, he's not bad; in 2006 he competed in the master's division world championships. (He's quick to point out he placed sixth out of six in his event.)\n\nThe diving is the sort of challenge that Brin, who has also dabbled in yoga, gymnastics, and acrobatics, is drawn to: equal parts physical and mental exertion. \"The dive itself is brief but intense,\" he says. \"You push off really hard and then have to twist right away. It does get your heart rate going.\"\n\nThere's another benefit as well: With every dive, Brin gains a little bit of leverage—leverage against a risk, looming somewhere out there, that someday he may develop the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease. Buried deep within each cell in Brin's body—in a gene called LRRK2, which sits on the 12th chromosome—is a genetic mutation that has been associated with higher rates of Parkinson's.\n\nNot everyone with Parkinson's has an LRRK2 mutation; nor will everyone with the mutation get the disease. But it does increase the chance that Parkinson's will emerge sometime in the carrier's life to between 30 and 75 percent. (By comparison, the risk for an average American is about 1 percent.) Brin himself splits the difference and figures his DNA gives him about 50-50 odds.\n\nThat's where exercise comes in. Parkinson's is a poorly understood disease, but research has associated a handful of behaviors with lower rates of disease, starting with exercise. One study found that young men who work out have a 60 percent lower risk. Coffee, likewise, has been linked to a reduced risk. For a time, Brin drank a cup or two a day, but he can't stand the taste of the stuff, so he switched to green tea. (\"Most researchers think it's the caffeine, though they don't know for sure,\" he says.)

As the aircraft circles the dusty landscape dotted with shrubbery, it throws up clouds of sand and grit, through which he can just make out a bull elephant, running.\n\nThe colossal creature bounds around, a bundle of muscle and terror. It’s been hit twice on the flank with tranquilizer darts but is fighting the numbness and won’t fall down. Instead it panics, heading towards a nearby watering hole. The helicopter hovers in its path to stop it: if the elephant collapses in the water, it will die. The standoff soon ends as the animal falls to its knees, crushing a bush on its way down, and the helicopter descends alongside several trucks. What follows is a peculiar scene.\n\nA group of people flip the elephant, which landed on its stomach, onto its side, so that it can breathe. Matson, a 53-year-old man from Shropshire, approaches, dressed in khaki trousers and sunglasses, like a safari ranger. He kneels next to the elephant and hooks its penis into a device that looks like a huge condom. A conservationist inserts a probe that emits small electrical shocks to stimulate the elephant’s prostate in a process known as electroejaculation. They start to pump. When they finish collecting the semen, they pack up their equipment and hover overhead in the helicopter until the elephant wakes up and canters off.\n\nI watch this strange series of events, which happened in October 2019, in a video sent by Matson over WhatsApp. The experience, he says, was one of the best of his life.\n\nAfter collection, the elephant’s semen was brought back to Matson’s farm to be stored and later used in breeding programs. Elephants in captivity have a high rate of stillbirths and infant mortality, according to the RSPCA. As the endangered animals face extinction in the coming decades, conservationists are working with elephant sanctuaries to gather semen samples in the wild, transport it to other locations, and hopefully improve the survival rate of calves born through artificial insemination.\n\nBut Matson is no park ranger or elephant conservationist. He runs an artificial insemination company for race horses from his family’s farm in Shropshire, England, which collects and stores semen from prizewinning studs for breeding purposes. He may not be an obvious choice to save the animal kingdom, but that is what he’s setting out to do.\n\nBy transferring his skills from horses to endangered species, Matson is planning to build the biggest biobank of animal cells in Europe. Nature’s SAFE, a charity which he founded in December 2020, aims to collect 50 million genetic samples and “freeze them in time,” storing cells from critically endangered species including the Amur leopard, black rhino and mountain chicken frog in cryogenic tanks. Working with partners including Chester Zoo, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, and researchers at the University of Oxford, his idea is to harvest and preserve samples of semen—as well as ova and other tissue—that could one day be used to regenerate dwindling animal populations and prevent them from going extinct.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"species\", \"save\", \"elephant\", \"matson\", \"samples\", \"resurrect\", \"endangered\", \"used\", \"plan\", \"elephants\", \"helicopter\", \"semen\", \"animal\", \"mans\", \"cant\", \"working\"]", "content_hash": "fda4cd8a4d01005dfcb6d7f6a3d1fe9f8fdbf7451a8b551cb9e57a8ef2900302", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:53.333537+00:00"}

Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance.\n\nBut a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it's a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist.\n\nPalantir has tried to correct the record itself in a series of blog posts with titles like “Palantir Is Not a Data Company” and “Palantir Is Still Not a Data Company.” In the latter, Palantir explains that “misconceptions can arise because our products are complicated,” but nonetheless, “it is absolutely possible” to accurately describe them to “people who are curious.”\n\nThe problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It's really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it's hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?”\n\nXia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is.\n\nIt’s not that former employees literally don’t know what Palantir is selling. In interviews with WIRED, they spoke fluidly about how its software can connect and transform different kinds of data collected by government agencies and corporations. But when asked to, say, name its direct business competitors, two former Palantir employees who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, struggled to come up with anything. “I still don't know how to answer that question, to be honest,” says one.\n\nJuan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"palantir\", \"does\", \"software\", \"works\", \"employees\", \"really\", \"data\", \"think\", \"company\", \"wired\", \"actually\"]", "content_hash": "96729e151ccc95b210d4d5ca4405f334c0976affdf2c0168788fa6caa0349ae3", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:54.167171+00:00"}

The CM/ECF system also suffered a breach in 2020 during the first Trump administration, and Politico reported on Tuesday that, in the recent attack, hackers exploited software vulnerabilities that remained unaddressed after being discovered five years ago in response to that first incident. Security researchers say that gaps in public information about the situation are concerning, particularly when it comes to lack of clarity on what data was affected.\n\n“We're more than a month into detecting this intrusion and still don't have a full accounting of what's impacted,” says Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and current vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy. “If we don't have sufficient logging to reconstruct attack activity, that would be extremely disappointing, because this system has been repeatedly targeted over the years.”\n\nIn response to a request for comment, the United States Courts referred WIRED to its August 7 statement, which says the federal judiciary “is taking additional steps to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents” and “further enhancing security of the system.” The courts also mention that the “vast majority of documents filed with the Judiciary’s electronic case management system are not confidential and indeed are readily available to the public,” while conceding that “some filings contain confidential or proprietary information that are sealed from public view.”\n\nThe Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the scope of the breach or who perpetrated it.\n\nReports this week that Russia was involved in the attack or may be the sole perpetrator have been difficult to interpret, given other indications that espionage actors backed by multiple countries—and possibly organized crime syndicates—may have been involved in or piggybacking on the breach for their own exfiltration.\n\nJohn Hultquist, chief analyst in Google's Threat Intelligence Group, says it is not uncommon to see multiple actors poking at a sensitive, and potentially vulnerable, system. “Investigations are regularly targeted by cyberespionage actors from several countries,” he says.\n\nNews of the breach comes as the Trump administration has continued to slash the federal workforce, including combing intelligence and cybersecurity agencies to remove officials or pressure them to resign.\n\n“I think federal investigators probably know who was behind the attack, but given the climate, I would suspect that no one wants to say with certainty,” Hunter Strategy's Williams says.\n\nMultiple administrations have struggled to get a handle on insidious espionage operations, particularly campaigns perpetrated by Chinese and Russian actors. But researchers emphasize that vulnerabilities enabling the attack on CM/ECF should have been addressed after the 2021 breach.\n\n“Enforcing policies to require that sealed or highly sensitive documents be handled via air-gapped systems or secure isolated networks rather than through CM/ECF or PACER would have dramatically limited exposure. And this was actually recommended post-2021,” says Tim Peck, senior threat researcher at the cybersecurity firm Securonix. “Instituting consistent, centralized logging—among other things—across all disparate CM/ECF instances could have enabled earlier detection and rapid mitigation before data exfiltration escalated as far as it did.”\n\nIn other words, highly targeted systems like those of the US Courts are likely going to suffer breaches. But the best way to reduce the likelihood and severity of these attacks is to make sure flaws actually get fixed after they're first exploited.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"federal\", \"courts\", \"arrived\", \"system\", \"attack\", \"cybersecurity\", \"breach\", \"trump\", \"cmecf\", \"case\", \"sealed\", \"disaster\", \"20\", \"actors\"]", "content_hash": "8b94e6b867af8895ce0844044f0b16eea2e819eddbc0cfb5083fbbbd067724fb", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:54.995086+00:00"}

The result? The future of “topping up” your car might look a lot like the present.\n\nThis week, the US Department of Transportation released new interim guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. These rules advise states on how to spend $5 billion in funding for new electric-vehicle fast chargers, with the goal of creating a nationwide highway network of some half a million public chargers. The NEVI program was first established in 2021 by the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill, with the goal of doing away with one of car buyers’ biggest electric-vehicle fears: that they’ll run out of charge.\n\nBut the program came under fire in the first weeks of Donald Trump's administration, part of a push to nix what the president has called an “electric vehicle mandate.” The DOT “paused” the program for months, halting some payments to the states. (The department was forced to restart funding in some states after a handful of blue ones won cases in court.)\n\nThe new guidance, which isn’t yet final, isn’t very different from the old language. The Federal Highway Administration, the agency in charge, says the goal is to “streamline” the program, making it easier for states to get charger money to the companies that build them, which then get chargers quickly into the ground. It directs states to submit new plans for using the charger funding within 30 days.\n\nThe agency also added some new provisions, including one that encourages states to give their money to charging locations where the businesses that own the stations also own the ground below it. The goal here is to “accelerate project delivery”—and it’s great news for incumbents in the (now mostly gas) fueling industry. Big winners will likely include the names you recognize from today’s road trips: truck stop operators like Pilot Flying K, Love’s Travel Stops, and TravelCenters of America; convenience store chains like Sheetz, WaWa, and Kwik Trip; and even some big-box stores, like Walmart.\n\nRight now, these federal recommendations don’t have the force of law behind them; they’re just “encouragements.” But if states go along with the guidance, and send billions in public charger money to these sorts of companies, then drivers with electric vehicles will likely be lured to the same sort of amenity-rich places to charge that their gas-powered cars visit today.\n\nThe move makes some sense, says Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, an EV charging data-analytics firm. Installing electric-vehicle charging is already complex work, requiring permits, construction, and the purchase of sometimes pricey and delayed electrical equipment. Add to that several different firms—a site host, plus a different company actually operating the charging equipment—and some projects have seen holdups. With the feds’ new arrangement, he says, “you don’t have to go through a lease negotiation, which can take a long time—months.”\n\nPlus, survey data suggests electric vehicle drivers like truck-stop-like amenities when they’re stopping to charge, a process that can take between 15 minutes and an hour, depending on the car. Tiffany Wlazlowski Neuman, a spokesperson for the National Association of Truck Stop Owners, a trade association that represents travel centers and truck stops, praised the new NEVI provision and said that drivers want continuity. “The refueling experience for electricity should be as similar as possible to today’s refueling experience and should work with consumer behaviors and habits,” she wrote in an email.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"local\", \"electric\", \"gas\", \"states\", \"truck\", \"goal\", \"station\", \"guidance\", \"program\", \"future\", \"vehicle\", \"funding\", \"charging\", \"ev\", \"money\"]", "content_hash": "5c5fd80679e9c75fcb52480b216e02889f630493e84089ca11c4ed6c0776ac2a", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:53:56.169696+00:00"}

Was Iran building a nuclear weapon?\n\nNo, I don't think anybody thinks Iran\n\nwas actively building a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe accusation, made particularly by Israel,\n\nis that Iran was setting up the conditions\n\nunder which it could build a nuclear weapon\n\nvery quickly if it wanted to.\n\nIran did have a nuclear weapons program before 2003,\n\nand the Iran deal was them essentially saying,\n\nWe're gonna close down\n\nand disable all the little things we were doing\n\nthat were bad and we won't do them anymore.\n\nOnce the United States left the Iran deal,\n\nIran has been creeping up beyond the limits of the deal.\n\nYou know, depending on what your stance is,\n\nyou either think that's because\n\nthey are trying to get ready to make a bomb,\n\nor because they're trying to compel the United States\n\nto come back to the negotiation table as a way of saying,\n\nLook, if you leave this deal, which we did,\n\nwe can do this now,\n\nand if you want us to stop, come back to the deal.\n\nNow, how are the nuclear talks going?\n\nI don't think that great.\n\nI don't think it's clear exactly what Iran wants, per se.\n\nThey're sort of leaving the door open for different options,\n\nwhich would make a lot of sense\n\ngiven the recent history that they've had\n\nwith the United States and with Israel,\n\nbut they were not, you know, racing to make a bomb.\n\nhellherekitten asks, WTF is a nuclear football?\n\nIt's basically a suitcase.\n\nWhat the nuclear football is meant to do\n\nis allow the president of the United States\n\nto order a nuclear strike\n\neven if they are not in the White House or the Pentagon.\n\nIf the president is visiting some other country\n\nor some other city, they have basically\n\na very burly, usually, military person\n\ncarrying a very heavy suitcase around.\n\nAnd in that suitcase,\n\nthere are information about nuclear war plans.\n\nThere are some communication tools probably\n\nto allow the president\n\nto easily link up with top generals and advisors\n\nand whatever is needed\n\nto authenticate the president's nuclear war order\n\nif the president decides to make that.\n\nSophikkelson asks, Once in a while,\n\nI think about how many nukes the US has lost.\n\nHow tf do you lose a nuke?\n\nFind them now.\n\nThere are a number of quote, unquote, lost nuclear weapons,\n\nand what that really means is there is a nuclear weapon\n\nthat was on say, an airplane or a submarine,\n\nand that airplane either crashed or the submarine sunk,\n\nand the weapon is now in the environment, in the world.\n\nThese kinds of accidents\n\nwere not super uncommon during the Cold War.\n\nThe United States had a program in the 1950s and 1960s\n\nto basically have airplanes with nuclear weapons\n\nflying in the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week,\n\nso that if nuclear war started,\n\nthey could have some kind of guarantee\n\nthat they'd have a plane ready to retaliate no matter what.\n\nSame thing with submarines.\n\nThey still go around\n\nwith nuclear weapons on them all the time.\n\nIf you have thousands of airplanes\n\nflying tens of thousands of flight hours,\n\nyou're gonna have an accident every once in a while.\n\nSome of these accidents have resulted\n\nin like the weapon either itself falling out of the plane,\n\nor in the case of a submarine,\n\njust going down to the bottom of the ocean.\n\nAny kind of mishap you can imagine,\n\na lot of them have happened.\n\nIn most cases, of course, the United States\n\nis very interested in recovering those weapons,\n\nboth because it's, you know, not a good look\n\nto have lost nuclear weapons,\n\nbut also they contain the fuel you might need\n\nto make more nuclear weapons\n\nand you don't want that falling in the wrong hands.\n\nAnd so the US always tried to recover these things,\n\nbut sometimes the warhead sunk so deep underground\n\nthat after weeks of trying to dig it out,\n\nthey couldn't get it or it's at the bottom of the ocean\n\nand they couldn't find it.\n\nThey're lost in the sense that the US can't recover them,\n\nnot that they don't know, more or less, where they are,\n\nand they're lost in the sense\n\nthat the US couldn't recover them\n\nand thinks nobody else could either,\n\nand decided to sort of cut their losses\n\nand, you know, maybe they put a monument that says,\n\nDon't dig here.\n\nBut they concluded\n\nthat if the army couldn't dig this thing up,\n\nnobody else could either.\n\nMatilda_Mother_67 asks,\n\nWhy did the United States bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki\n\ninstead of some military headquarters\n\nor other places where civilians weren't?\n\nThere were a lot of processes and meetings\n\nand decisions made along the way\n\nabout what this bomb was, how it should work,\n\nwhat it would be used against.\n\nAt the beginning of making the bomb, like say 1943,\n\nthe attitude was, We'll probably use this\n\nagainst some sort of military installation.\n\nThe first target they even discussed\n\nwas basically the Japanese equivalent of Pearl Harbor,\n\nit's called Truk.\n\nAnd sure, there would be some civilians there,\n\nbut it's not dropping it in the middle of a city.\n\nBy 1945, 2 years later,\n\none, Truk is not an issue militarily anymore.\n\nThey had cut it off. It was not a target.\n\nAnd two, the United States had gotten in the habit\n\nof targeting cities.\n\nIn the early part of 1945, the United States\n\nbegan firebombing Japanese cities with napalm.\n\nThey burnt Tokyo, they burnt Osaka.\n\nThey ended up burning 67 Japanese cities\n\nby dropping basically flaming gasoline on them.\n\nThe other issue is that the bomb they ended up with\n\nwas one that would work best\n\nif you detonated it pretty high in the air.\n\nIf you detonate it high in the air,\n\nyou spread the blast damage out wider,\n\nbut your blast damage is also less intense.\n\nSo if your target is some built-up bunker,\n\nyou're not gonna destroy it\n\nby blowing up the bomb in the air.\n\nIf your target is a house,\n\nyou don't need as much blast pressure to destroy it.\n\nSo they had a bomb that they ended up with,\n\nthrough technical decisions along the way,\n\nthat would be most impressive if you used it on a city.\n\nAnd they had many discussions about what kind of target,\n\nwhat's the goal of this weapon.\n\nThe goal of the weapon was essentially psychological.\n\nThey wanted to cause the Japanese people\n\nto say, We cannot tolerate this.\n\nWe cannot win. Let's surrender.\n\nOne of the people involved in the discussion\n\nsaid that the goal was to have the Japanese\n\nbasically capitulate to the power of the universe.\n\nOh, you don't wanna surrender to the United States\n\nor the Soviet Union?\n\nWell what if we use the power of the sun to destroy you?\n\nTo me, the really interesting thing is that Hiroshima\n\nwas not their first choice at all for a target.\n\nThe first choice that the military had was Kyoto,\n\nformer capital of Japan.\n\nIt was taken off the list by the Secretary of War,\n\nHenry Stimson, because he thought\n\nthat the city was too civilian in nature,\n\nwas a cultural heritage site.\n\nHiroshima got then bumped up to first place\n\nbecause it had some military bases\n\nand manufacturing in it.\n\nIt had not yet been bombed.\n\nIts geography was such that it was\n\nsort of like a bowl-shaped city surrounded by hills,\n\nand that meant it would kind of intensify\n\nthe effect of the weapon.\n\nSo from the point of view of the United States military\n\nand the scientists who consulted from them,\n\nit was a perfectly good target.\n\nNagasaki was only added to the target list\n\nafter Kyoto was taken off of it\n\nbecause they wanted a backup target.\n\nThe actual target for the second bombing run\n\nwas a different city, Kokura.\n\nKokura had a major arsenal in the center of it\n\nthat produced weapons for the Japanese\n\nand was surrounded by workers' houses.\n\nSo by their criteria, this was a great target.\n\nWhen they got to Kokura though,\n\nthey found that it was covered by smoke or clouds or haze.\n\nIt's not clear exactly what.\n\nBut they could not see it to exactly target the bomb on it.\n\nSo they went to the backup target,\n\nwhich was Nagasaki, which was nearby.\n\nmatthewswaite asks, I can't help\n\nbut think gun control debates\n\nmirror that of nuclear weapons proliferation.\n\nDoes every country having nukes make us all safer?\n\nThis is a classic question.\n\nIs the world safer if there are only\n\na couple countries with nuclear weapons\n\nor would it be safer if all the countries\n\nhad nuclear weapons?\n\nIf there were a lot of countries with nuclear weapons,\n\npresumably they would be very hesitant\n\nto go to war with one another\n\nbecause the consequences would be terrible.\n\nOn the other hand, if you think that the chances\n\nof either accidental nuclear war\n\nor people thinking nuclear war was winnable,\n\nor terrorism, if you think the chances\n\nof those are relatively high,\n\nthen more nuclear weapons in the world\n\nis a much more dangerous world\n\nbecause that's a world in which nuclear war\n\nis more likely to occur.\n\nIt's not clear what the answer is here.\n\nGenerally speaking, I'm more swayed by the arguments\n\nthat is a little bit dangerous\n\nto have lots of countries with nuclear weapons in the world.\n\nI know that's a really hot take,\n\nbut I don't trust the systems\n\nor governments of these countries to be sort of perfect\n\nwith regard to they're not starting a nuclear war.\n\nAnd if you don't think that they're going to be perfect,\n\nthen it becomes very dangerous over time,\n\nthe more people who have nuclear weapons.\n\nHuge_Bag69 asks, Enriched uranium, what is it?\n\nWhat is the process of enriching?\n\nHow dangerous is it on its own?\n\nSo uranium is an element.\n\nYou can mine it out of the ground.\n\nIt's a rock.\n\nYou can even get it out of sea water.\n\nIt's relatively abundant.\n\nBy itself, if we went out and got a rock of uranium,\n\nthe uranium we would find\n\nwould have two types of uranium inside of it.\n\nOne of 'em would be called uranium-238.\n\nThere would be 99% of that\n\nin any uranium we pulled out of the ground.\n\nAnd less than 1% of it,\n\nit's like 0.7% would be uranium-235.\n\nSo these are two of the same element,\n\nbut they differ in that uranium-238 has three more neutrons\n\ninside of it than uranium-235.\n\nSo we call these different isotopes.\n\nUranium-238 will not explode in a bomb.\n\nUranium-235 will.\n\nSo enrichment is when we take this uranium\n\nand pull out the uranium-235,\n\nalmost literally atom by atom.\n\nThis is a very difficult process to do\n\nbecause the difference between these\n\nis only three neutrons, which is not very much.\n\nThey are chemically identical.\n\nSo we have to rely on the fact\n\nthat one's a little bit lighter than the other.\n\nSo uranium enrichment,\n\nthere's different processes for doing it.\n\nAnd the most famous right now is the centrifuge\n\nwhere we basically are spinning\n\naround uranium in a gaseous form,\n\nand as we spin it,\n\nthe centrifugal forces will cause the lighter uranium\n\nto move slightly and more one direction\n\nand the heavier slightly another,\n\nand we skim off the part that would have the lighter.\n\nAnd we have to run it through another centrifuge\n\nto skim off a little more\n\nand then another to skim off a little more.\n\nAnd so we're taking advantage\n\nof little tiny statistical differences\n\nin how heavy they are.\n\nAnd we do this for thousands of centrifuges\n\nand you will eventually end up\n\nwith more and more uranium-235.\n\nWhen we want uranium for fuel in a nuclear power plant,\n\nwe tend to enrich it up to about 3% uranium-235.\n\nWhen we want it for a bomb,\n\nwe want it to be much higher than that.\n\nThe bomb dropped on Hiroshima\n\nwas about 80% uranium-235.\n\nIn the United States now, the standard amount in a weapon,\n\nif we use enriched uranium, is around 93% enriched uranium.\n\nThe4thResident asks, Wait, but Einstein\n\nwas not a part of the Manhattan Project,\n\nso how or why did they get his help during it?\n\nEinstein's role in the atomic bomb\n\nwas at the very beginning.\n\nHe wrote a letter to President Roosevelt saying,\n\nHey, we have learned how to split atoms.\n\nGermany might be working on this.\n\nMaybe somebody in the United States government\n\nshould be looking at this.\n\nAnd that's more or less\n\nhis role in the whole Manhattan Project.\n\nWhy didn't they use him?\n\nThey actually did consider using him\n\nand they concluded two things.\n\nOne, Einstein at this point is pretty old.\n\nHe's not your cutting-edge scientist.\n\nThe kind of science he does\n\nis not actually that useful for making an atomic bomb.\n\nYes, yes, =mc2 sort of explains, in a way,\n\nwhere the energy comes from an atomic bomb.\n\nIt does not tell you how to make one.\n\nIt doesn't tell you how to make a factory\n\nand design the things and the parts.\n\nYou don't need somebody like Einstein to do that.\n\nThe other thing is that Einstein\n\nwas considered politically radical.\n\nHe supported really out-there ideas like civil rights.\n\nAnd that, at that time, meant that he was considered\n\nto be politically questionable\n\nby some people in the US government.\n\nAnd so if he is the kind of person who,\n\nto be fair, might have strong ideas\n\nabout how atomic bombs ought to be used\n\nand has a lot of fame\n\nand is the kind of person that presidents would listen to,\n\nmaybe you don't want him to be in the project\n\nif your goal is to just sort of get the thing done.\n\nCoastalBuckeye asks,\n\nIs there still a radiation field in Hiroshima or Nagasaki?\n\nGreat question.\n\nHiroshima and Nagasaki had atomic bombs dropped on them\n\nin World War II.\n\nHere's Hiroshima. This is not far from ground zero.\n\nYou can see this building, the very famous Atomic Bomb Dome,\n\nground zero is very close to that.\n\nThese weapons were detonated very high above the city.\n\nIf you look at pictures of these bombs,\n\nthis is a mockup of the kind of bomb dropped in Hiroshima.\n\nThis is one for Nagasaki.\n\nYou can see they've got this equipment on them,\n\nweird little wires.\n\nThese are fuses that detect\n\nhow high above the ground the bomb is,\n\nand they were set to detonate at the height\n\nthat the scientists had calculated\n\nwould maximize the blast effect of the weapon.\n\nYou can think of the blast\n\nas going sort of as a sphere out from the explosion.\n\nAnd if it's really close to the ground,\n\na lot of that is gonna be going sort of sideways\n\nand it's gonna be running into buildings\n\nand they're gonna be absorbing the energy\n\nand also reducing it as a consequence.\n\nIf you detonate it in the air,\n\nyou're sort of going down with the blast force\n\nand it's gonna be much wider area.\n\nSo it was detonated high in the air.\n\nThe consequence of that is the people\n\nat Hiroshima and Nagasaki,\n\nthey got a blast of immediate radiation.\n\nIt's like almost like a light switch turning on and off.\n\nYou wouldn't be able to see it,\n\nbut imagine it's just like a quick exposure,\n\nalmost like X-rays or something like that.\n\nAnd that was very bad for the people\n\nwho were in the range at which that would occur.\n\nBut it's a short immediate effect.\n\nIt's sort of almost like a one-time exposure.\n\nThe thing that makes nuclear weapons so contaminating\n\nis the nuclear fallout.\n\nThese are the split atoms from the weapon\n\nand these are in the mushroom cloud.\n\nAnd one interesting thing\n\nyou can actually see in some of these pictures,\n\nso this is a picture of Nagasaki's mushroom cloud\n\ntaken from someone on the one of the airplanes\n\nthat was involved in the bombing of Nagasaki.\n\nAnd if you look closely,\n\nyou can see the cloud is actually two different parts.\n\nYou have this top part, the head,\n\nand then you have this dark stem underneath it,\n\nand you can actually see that they don't connect.\n\nThis is an artifact of the weapon being detonated higher up.\n\nThis cloud contains\n\nthe most radioactive residues from the bomb.\n\nThis is mostly created by fire and debris\n\nand dust that is being pulled up\n\nby the negative pressure of this cloud moving upwards.\n\nAnd it is not that radioactive.\n\nNow, if this bomb had been detonated on the ground,\n\nthese two parts would be mixed together.\n\nAnd if that happens,\n\nthen the radioactive bits attach themselves to the dirt\n\nand then fall out of the cloud relatively quickly\n\nbecause the dirt is pretty heavy, relatively speaking.\n\nIf it doesn't happen, this part stays relatively light\n\nand it'll blow on with the wind\n\nand as it blows, it'll take a while\n\nfor it to start to fall out of the cloud.\n\nAnd what that gets you is two things.\n\nOne, the most radioactive stuff with short half lives,\n\nthey get to sort of burn out before they fall down.\n\nBut this cloud, because it has time to spread,\n\nit means that it's diluting.\n\nSo more area gets some radioactive bits,\n\nbut they get less like per square meter, per square foot.\n\nSo the amount of radiation is diffused in a way\n\nthat doesn't actually make it a contamination hazard.\n\nSo the long and short of it\n\nis because they're detonated at high altitude,\n\nthey did not really get a lot of nuclear fallout.\n\nToday, they are not radioactive in any significant way.\n\nIf the bombs had been detonated on the ground,\n\nit would be a different story.\n\nxjsscx on Reddit asks, What actually happens\n\nto someone in an atomic bomb explosion?\n\nThe first thing, if you saw a nuclear weapon go off,\n\none, the brightness of it, it's very bright.\n\nWith that brightness comes this flash of radiation.\n\nSo if you are close enough to an atomic bomb,\n\nyou will instantly get a lot of radioactive particles,\n\ngamma rays, beta particles, things like this\n\ngoing through your body.\n\nFor the Hiroshima bomb,\n\nthe radius from the detonation point\n\nwhere you get a fatal amount of radiation\n\nis about three quarters of a mile.\n\nIf you're in that zone, you're probably dead\n\nno matter what happens next.\n\nIf you're a little out of that zone,\n\nyou might get some radiation.\n\nThat is probably not your biggest concern\n\nfor most nuclear weapons, but it's not the best, right?\n\nThe next thing that you would experience is heat.\n\nThe surface of the fireball is hotter than the sun.\n\nBriefly.\n\nIf you're in direct line of sight with this,\n\nit's sort of like if the sun\n\nwas suddenly a lot closer to you than it is right now.\n\nIf you're really close to the fireball,\n\nyou could be literally vaporized as people say.\n\nMost of the people at Hiroshima Nagasaki are not vaporized\n\nor melted or anything, but they were severely burned.\n\nYou can get really bad burns.\n\nThe next effect,\n\nthat fireball in that first split second of it going off,\n\nis sort of super-heating the air around it.\n\nAnd what's gonna happen then\n\nis it's going to be moving outward.\n\nThis is the shock wave, the blast wave.\n\nAnd as it goes out, it's this sort of wave of pressure\n\nthat's going to intersect with the ground\n\nand move along it and push,\n\nand the more it goes, the weaker it goes.\n\nBut this is powerful enough at different distances\n\nto do a lot of damage.\n\nSo at Hiroshima,\n\nif you were about 300 meters from ground zero,\n\nthat would be enough blast pressure,\n\nabout 20 pounds per square inch,\n\nto destroy almost any building that is standing.\n\nAny buildings that are still remaining at Hiroshima,\n\nlike the famous Atomic Bomb Dome, are gutted.\n\nLike nobody's doing well who was inside this building.\n\nThey're all dead.\n\nIf you go out a little further,\n\nif you were about 1.7 kilometers\n\nfrom ground zero at Hiroshima,\n\nthat's the radius at which there's enough\n\nto definitely destroy light structures.\n\nSo houses, things like that.\n\nYou go out further to maybe about 2.8 miles,\n\nand now the blast wave is weak enough\n\nthat the most it's doing is sort of breaking windows.\n\nThat's still not great.\n\nIf you're standing at a window as this thing comes to you,\n\nit's gonna break all the glass and push it into you,\n\nand now you've been injured by a window.\n\nSo depending on where you are,\n\nthere's different effects that can happen.\n\nStranfort asks on Reddit,\n\nFor how long do I stay in a fallout shelter\n\nafter a nuclear war?\n\nThe amount of time you need to stay in there\n\ndepends on how radioactive the fallout is.\n\nNow a lot of people think of fallout shelters\n\nlike the game or show Fallout,\n\nand they think we're gonna stay in there\n\nfor a hundred years or something like that.\n\nThat is not what they're built to do.\n\nThey are built to basically accommodate people\n\nto maybe stay in there for at most two weeks,\n\nmaybe even less.\n\nYou might recognize these signs.\n\nThese are from the 1960s program\n\nto identify places that could be used as fallout shelters.\n\nA fallout shelter is not meant\n\nto protect you from a nuclear weapon that drops on you.\n\nWhat it's meant to do is be a place\n\nthat puts mass, so concrete or dirt ideally,\n\nin between you and the outside world\n\nso that if radioactive particles fall on top of you,\n\nthere is something in between you and them\n\nto cut the amount of radiation.\n\nSo you can think of it when you go to the dentist\n\nand they take an X-ray\n\nand they put one of these heavy lead aprons on you.\n\nIt's sort of like a building equivalent of that lead apron.\n\nMac60five asks, How dangerous is Chernobyl Today?\n\nThere are people who visit Chernobyl\n\nor did before the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\nThere are people who work at Chernobyl still today,\n\nand they have means of checking\n\nhow much radiation they pick up.\n\nThere are tools called dosimeters.\n\nThis is one from the Cold War.\n\nIt basically tracks how much radiation you get.\n\nThis one works by looking through it at a light\n\nand a little wire moves as it absorbs radiation.\n\nAnd the workers on these kinds of places\n\nare making sure that the amount of radiation they pick up\n\nis within what we consider to be the safe amounts.\n\nYou probably wouldn't wanna live in Chernobyl though.\n\nThere are some people who have been living there,\n\npeople who used to live there\n\nthat eventually went back and they've said,\n\nYou know what? I just wanna live in my own home.\n\nI don't care if it's contaminated.\n\nAre they at risk?\n\nWell, a little.\n\nBut if they're 70 years old and living at Chernobyl\n\nincreases their cancer risk by say 5%,\n\nthey're probably gonna die of something else anyway\n\nbecause it takes a long time\n\nfor those kinds of cancers to develop.\n\nIf we talk about, what if 10,000 people lived there\n\nand the cancer risk goes up by 5%,\n\nyou're gonna start seeing that\n\nas 5% more cancers in this community than you would already.\n\naustinsburner asks, How tf does radiation work?\n\nHow does a place be radioactive?\n\nHow does someone die from radiation poisoning?\n\nYou can think of it as little particles.\n\nThat's basically what the word radiation means.\n\nIt means little things spitting out.\n\nAnd there's lots of different kinds of radiation.\n\nThe kind that people are usually talking about\n\nis called ionizing radiation, and that means radiation\n\nof types and energies that are capable\n\nof knocking electrons off of other atoms and molecules.\n\nThe problem is that if you're made out of cells,\n\nand especially if you have DNA,\n\nionizing things, that changes their chemistry.\n\nAnd if you were a rock, who would care?\n\nBut if you're a biological system,\n\nthat means you're like shooting little bullets into cells\n\nwhich can kill them, which is fine.\n\nYou have a lot of cells.\n\nOr it can, in some rare cases,\n\nchange the DNA in a way that turns it into a cancerous cell.\n\nRadiation poisoning is when you get so much radiation\n\nthat the number of cells you're killing\n\nbecomes actually significant.\n\nSo radioactive contamination is when a place\n\nhas radioactive stuff that is sending out the radiation.\n\nSo I have a Geiger counter here.\n\nA Geiger counter is a tool for detecting radioactivity.\n\nSo what it has in it is a sensor that can tell\n\nwhen a radioactive particle has gone across it.\n\nAnd whenever it does this,\n\nyou're hearing this little click happening.\n\nWhy does it click?\n\nBecause we hooked it to a speaker\n\nand we wanna be able to hear it.\n\nNow I could have a radioactive substance.\n\nThis is trinitite, the glass from the first nuclear test.\n\nThis is something that contains trace amounts\n\nof plutonium and uranium\n\nand long-lived fission products.\n\nAnd if I put the sensor over it,\n\n[Geiger counter clicks]\n\nyou can hear that the clicking increases by a bit.\n\nThe air right above this radioactive material\n\nis getting about twice as much radioactivity\n\nas the normal air around here.\n\nThat's not that much.\n\nIf this was something actually dangerous,\n\nit would be getting a lot more, a hundred times more.\n\nBut this is the sort of tool\n\nthat lets you measure when these radioactive particles\n\nare being emitted from this radioactive substance.\n\nGlitteringWeakness88 on Reddit asks,\n\nWhat is the theoretical upper power limit\n\nof a nuke we can produce currently?\n\nIf you wanted to,\n\nyou can make essentially an unlimited power nuclear weapon.\n\nA thermonuclear weapon basically works\n\nby having one nuclear weapon act\n\nas sort of the detonator for another nuclear weapon.\n\nAnd if you wanted to, you could make\n\nthat weapon be the detonator for another nuclear weapon.\n\nAnd that detonator for another nuclear weapon.\n\nThe largest nuclear weapon ever made\n\nwas the Soviet Tsar Bomba.\n\nIt was tested in 1961 as a 50-megaton-sized weapon,\n\nso 50 million tons of TNT,\n\nand that was at half its power.\n\nIt was deliberately scaled back by half\n\nto prevent contamination.\n\nBy comparison, the Hiroshima bomb\n\nis 15,000 tons of TNT.\n\nSo this is a weapon thousands of times more powerful\n\nthan the first atomic bombs.\n\nThe United States could have done that.\n\nThey actually looked into doing\n\nthat kind of thing in the Cold War and decided not to.\n\nSo the largest weapon that I know of\n\nthat was ever taken seriously\n\nby weapon scientists in the United States\n\nwas called the Sundial.\n\nIt was never built.\n\nThey didn't get that far in researching it.\n\nBut it was a weapon that was 10,000 megatons of TNT.\n\nWhy did the United States not do this?\n\nWhy did even the Soviet Union not really do this?\n\nThe Tsar Bomba was sort of a stunt\n\nmore than a practical weapon.\n\nThe answer is, one, you don't get that much from it.\n\nBecause of the way nuclear weapons work,\n\nbecause they're basically a sphere expanding in the air.\n\nThink of it as a balloon that you're like pumping air into.\n\nWhat we care about for the damage\n\nis the amount of the balloon that's gonna touch the ground.\n\nA lot of that balloon is not gonna touch the ground.\n\nAnd as we're putting energy into it,\n\nthe part that's touching the ground,\n\nit's not increasing as a linear function.\n\nIt's increasing as what's called a cubic root.\n\nThe takeaway is,\n\nif we wanted to double the damage of a weapon,\n\nwe typically have to increase the size of the weapon\n\nby around eight times.\n\nThe real killer though is, to make them bigger,\n\nwe do more or less have to linearly increase the weight\n\nand size of the weapon.\n\nSo the Tsar Bomba is a powerful weapon,\n\nbut it's the size of a school bus.\n\nThat weapon could not fit inside\n\nthe airplane that carried it\n\nand had to sort of sit underneath it like a big egg.\n\nIf you are another country\n\nand you see a plane coming towards you\n\nwith a big egg attached to it,\n\nyou're gonna really work hard to shoot that down.\n\nThat is not convenient.\n\nIf you're talking about weapons\n\nthat are the size of the Sundial, 10,000 megatons,\n\nthat's a weapon that's probably\n\nthe size of the space shuttle.\n\nThat's not easy to use. That's not easy to deploy.\n\nThat's gonna be also really expensive as an aside.\n\nTrends in nuclear weapons design didn't go in that area.\n\nWhat they did was they went for more compact weapons\n\nso you can put 10 of them onto one missile\n\nand then target 10 targets with one missile.\n\nIt's a weapon the size of a large trash can,\n\nbut it's 30 times more explosive than Hiroshima.\n\nThat's peak weapons design, not just more bang.\n\nPerfect-Football2616 on Reddit asks,\n\nDid the tactic of duck and cover\n\nprovide any protection from an actual nuclear strike?\n\nDuck and Cover was a public education program\n\nput out by the United States government,\n\nand it was particularly aimed at school children.\n\nAnd you'll see pictures\n\nof children hiding under their desk from this period.\n\nThere was a short film created\n\nwith a turtle cartoon mascot, Bert the Turtle,\n\ntrying to talk to students about nuclear war.\n\nAnd, of course, a lot of it looks pretty sketchy.\n\nThere are lots of people who lived through this who said,\n\nThat was the moment I realized\n\nadults did not know what they were doing\n\nif they thought this desk\n\nwas gonna protect me from an atomic bomb.\n\nThey are not saying\n\nthat if an atomic bomb lands on your school,\n\nyour desk is gonna keep you safe.\n\nWhat they are doing with this policy\n\nis saying there's gonna be an area where the bomb goes off,\n\nwhere you just have no hope.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nThey don't say this in the movie\n\nbecause it's aimed at children.\n\nThey don't even say this things aimed at adults\n\nbecause the United States government\n\nhas a very hard time admitting\n\nthat people are gonna die in large numbers\n\nif nuclear weapons go off,\n\neven though it is self evidently true.\n\nThere's also a zone much further out\n\nwhere you're far enough away that you'll say,\n\nWhat was that? Oh my gosh, what's going on?\n\nYou are not going to be affected by the weapon, right?\n\nYou're gonna learn from the news.\n\nSo in between is a pretty small zone\n\nwhere you have a chance of surviving\n\nif you do the right thing.\n\nDuck and Cover is for that zone,\n\nand it's for an area where the blast pressure\n\nis going to be enough\n\nthat it is gonna be sort of like an earthquake.\n\nThey're worried about the ceiling collapsing,\n\nthey're worried about windows breaking.\n\nThey're worried that if you have exposed skin,\n\nyou might get burned.\n\nAnd so the tactic is get down,\n\ncover up your most vulnerable parts,\n\nand you can increase your chance of survival\n\na little bit that way.\n\nTheMuteNewt on Reddit, great name,\n\nHow close did Nazi Germany actually get\n\nto developing an atomic weapon?\n\nNazi Germany did not get close\n\nto making an atomic bomb.\n\nAt the end of World War II they were almost to the place\n\nthat the United States was in 1942.\n\nSo they almost had a prototype nuclear reactor,\n\nnot an atomic bomb.\n\nWhy not? Because they weren't trying to make an atomic bomb.\n\nI know that's a hot take\n\nbecause we like to talk about the race for the atomic bomb.\n\nThe Americans feared they were working on atomic bomb,\n\nbut the Germans had actually decided they were gonna have\n\na pretty small research program for nuclear reactors,\n\nmaybe in the future, making atomic bombs.\n\nBut they concluded in 1942\n\nthat it would take a lot of work\n\nfrom a lot of their scientists\n\nto try and make an atomic bomb\n\nthat could be useful for World War II.\n\nAnd in 1942, they thought they were gonna win the war\n\nso they didn't think they needed an atomic bomb.\n\nThey thought that making an atomic bomb\n\nwould be very hard and they were correct on that.\n\nAnd as a result, they thought nobody else\n\nwas gonna make one either.\n\nSo this is a problem for after the war.\n\nWell, that's it. That's all the questions.\n\nI hope you learned something.\n\nI hope you don't make an atomic bomb.\n\nUntil next time.

know what it is or can't pronounce it,\n\ndon't buy it and surely don't eat it.\n\nWhether you can pronounce a word or not\n\nhas nothing to do with what the thing is.\n\nI mean, it took me years to figure out\n\nhow to pronounce acai,\n\nand that doesn't mean that it's harmful.\n\nThis is 5R-1S-1,2-dihydroxyethyl-3,4-dihydroxyfuran-25H-one.\n\nNow, if you saw that word on a label,\n\nyou might be scared of it based on Chamath's logic,\n\nbut the colloquial word is just vitamin C.\n\nThe name of chemicals tell scientists\n\nimportant information about them,\n\nhow many molecules are in them, how they're organized,\n\nand their properties.\n\nThis logic about avoiding foods or ingredients\n\nwith chemical names you don't understand or can't pronounce\n\nis just an example of chemophobia,\n\nirrational fear of chemicals,\n\nand this has been a clever marketing ploy\n\nby many in the wellness industry\n\nto scare people away from things\n\nthat have no potential risk to their health.\n\ndecor_throwaway wants to know,\n\nHave you all seen the Dirty Dozen list?\n\nWhat are we supposed to feed our families?\n\nThe Dirty Dozen list is an annual list\n\nwritten by the Environmental Working Group or the EWG,\n\nand they claim it is the 12 most contaminated\n\nconventionally grown fruits and vegetables,\n\nand they're covered in pesticides,\n\nand you should avoid them, scaring people away\n\nfrom very safe and nutritious, conventionally grown\n\nfruits and vegetables that are half the cost\n\nof organic options, in order to direct people\n\nto buy organic versions of those items.\n\nAccording to this year's list,\n\nspinach is the dirtiest of the Dirty Dozen.\n\nThey fail to include the fact that the amount of spinach\n\nyou'd have to eat in order to hit the safety threshold\n\nfor pesticide levels is 145 pounds of spinach.\n\nThis is just two pounds of spinach.\n\nWhat the USDA's annual pesticide residue report\n\nactually says is that in 99% of all sampled foods,\n\nthose trace levels of pesticides\n\nare well below the safety thresholds\n\nfor each of those different substances.\n\n@calleymeans asks, While 40% of modern humans\n\nwill get cancer, our closest relatives, chimpanzees,\n\nrarely get it, despite sharing nearly 99% of our genes.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nWell, Calley, I'll help you\n\nsince you're a wellness industry lobbyist\n\nand have no scientific or medical expertise,\n\nchimps do get cancer.\n\nCancers are diseases of aging, broadly.\n\nIn humans, the median age of cancer onset is 60 years old.\n\nAs you get older, your cells get older too,\n\nand cancer occurs because of mutations\n\nin very specific families of genes.\n\nThere's one tumor suppressor gene called P53\n\nthat is very differently expressed\n\nin people versus chimpanzees, and that's a big reason\n\nwhy more chimpanzees don't get cancer.\n\nBut the biggest reason is that in the wild,\n\nchimpanzees only live to be between 25 and 33 years old.\n\nBut we know that in captivity, when chimps live to 40, 50,\n\nand beyond, they do develop cancer.\n\nGrassfedguru48 wants to know, Genuine question,\n\nwhy has Red dye 40 not been

medicines,\n\nincluding some gummy candies, medicines.\n\nThey're colored so that people don't misdose them,\n\nas well as meal replacement shakes.\n\nColorings are really important for people's perception\n\nof foods and flavors,\n\nparticularly those with sensory issues.\n\nAnd if you look at the acceptable daily intake\n\nof something like Red 40, in the U.S.,\n\nit's seven milligrams per kilogram per day,\n\nwhich is the same as it is in Japan,\n\nthe same as it is in Europe, the same as it is in Canada,\n\nand the same as it is in Australia.\n\nAnd there's no way that you would be eating\n\nan excess in your daily diet,\n\neven if you only ate red-colored gummy candy\n\nfor your entire daily intake.\n\nWe're not just gonna remove colorings.\n\nThey're going to be replaced with other colorings,\n\nnaturally derived chemicals.\n\nFor example, one of which is cochineal,\n\nwhich is a red coloring that is extracted\n\nfrom scale insects.\n\nSo it's very ecologically damaging\n\nbecause these insects live on certain cacti species,\n\nand they're harvested by farm workers.\n\nThey have high rates of allergenicity.\n\nWe don't have that with Red 40.\n\nAnd on top of that, vegans and people that adhere\n\nto Muslim or kosher dietary habits cannot eat foods\n\nthat are colored using insect-derived coloring.\n\nSo you're not actually solving a problem.\n\nIn many ways, you're making a worse problem.\n\nEast-Illustrator-225 wants to know, What does MAHA mean?\n\nMAHA is the acronym for RFK Jr.'s former slogan\n\nof his failed presidential campaign.\n\nIt stands for Make America Healthy Again.\n\nThe problem is that the whole MAHA platform\n\nand the movement are actually in direct opposition\n\nto what would make us healthier.\n\nWe could be expanding healthcare access,\n\nbut instead we're actually removing that\n\nfrom the most vulnerable people\n\nwith cuts to Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nAnd with unfounded accusations about the harms of vaccines,\n\nwe're seeing resurgence\n\nin many of these preventable diseases.\n\nThey're also trying to cut funding for SNAP,\n\nwhich provides food access and financial support\n\nfor lower-income families.\n\nSo if we really want to address\n\nsome of these chronic illnesses that are the leading causes\n\nof death in the U.S., we might want to continue to develop\n\nnovel and innovative cancer screenings and treatments.\n\nUnfortunately, this current administration\n\njust gutted funding for cancer research,\n\nwhich is certainly going to have the opposite effect.\n\nRobynInWellness says, High-dose vitamin C\n\nis lethal to cancer while leaving healthy cells unscathed.\n\nCancer cells can't survive it. They implode from within.\n\nYeah, none of this is true.\n\nJust like with most pseudoscience claims,\n\nthat nugget of truth that vitamin C is incredibly important\n\nat a small level has been wildly exaggerated.\n\nNow, vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin,\n\nso if you overdose on it, it will be excreted in your urine.\n\nThe claims that relate to megadosing\n\nor intravenous doses of vitamin C and killing cancer cells\n\nare all based on Petri dish studies\n\nwhere they're growing cancer cells on a piece of plastic\n\nand they're blasting them with vitamin C.\n\nBut you can kill cells on a piece of plastic with anything.\n\nIf you pour pure water on cells\n\nin a Petri dish, they'll explode.\n\nUnfortunately, people who believe this information\n\noften will then forego proven cancer treatments\n\nbefore the cancer progresses to a later stage.\n\nloshed says, I just spent the past hour\n\nreading about why fluoride is bad and freaking out.\n\nFreaking out. Tin-hatting like a mother.\n\nThey're killing us!\n\nGood news is, they're not killing us.\n\nFluoride is everywhere. It's ubiquitous in nature.\n\nDecades ago, some dentists noticed that in areas\n\nwhere people had discolored teeth,\n\nthey had extremely low rates of cavities.\n\nIt was because of naturally high levels\n\nof fluoride in their water.\n\nWe fluorinate water at a very, very small level,\n\n0.7 parts per million.\n\nSo to put that in context,\n\na gallon of water is about 3.78 kilograms.\n\nWe would be adding about 2.6 microliters\n\nof fluoride solution, 1/20 of a drop of water.\n\nIf you tried to drink enough water\n\nwhere you might experience fluoride toxicity,\n\nyou would have to be drinking 357 liters of water\n\nor 94 gallons in a day.\n\nYou would die from water toxicity\n\nway before you would experience\n\nadverse effects from the fluoride.\n\nFluoridated water has over 75 years of data\n\nto show that it prevents cavities\n\nand improves dental health.\n\nThe studies that are cited to suggest that fluoride\n\nlowers IQ or can cause neurodevelopmental issues,\n\nthey're not correcting for other variables\n\nthat can impact the outcome, such as high levels of arsenic\n\nor asbestos in the environment within those communities.\n\nThose exposures can credibly cause\n\nsome of those issues that they're observing.\n\nLotsName wants to know,\n\nSo we should stop giving kids milk at school\n\nbecause of the hormones that are in milk, right?\n\nNo. You don't need to fear milk because of hormones.\n\nThe current body of evidence suggests that among children\n\nwho enter puberty earlier than normal,\n\nit's often linked to obesity or excess adiposity.\n\nIt has nothing to do with hormones in milk.\n\nMilk generally always contains hormones because cows,\n\njust like humans and other animals, produce hormones.\n\nSometimes you might see on the label,\n\nno RBST added to the milk.\n\nThis is referring to bovine somatotropin,\n\na hormone that's already naturally produced by cows.\n\nDairy cows, sometimes they're given\n\nadditional amounts of bovine somatotropin\n\nbecause it can increase milk production.\n\nBovine is the key word there.\n\nThis is a cow-specific hormone.\n\nIt has no biological effect on people,\n\neven if you were to deliberately consume it.\n\nClaims about all sorts of other growth hormones\n\nor sex hormones is just patently false.\n\nEven if there were a biological effect,\n\nif you pasteurize your milk, which you all should be,\n\nit's not gonna have any biological impact.\n\n@driptechh says, I developed EDS and POTS\n\nwithin the year that I got the vaccine,\n\nand my heart health has been in steady rapid decline.\n\nI really urge anyone who thinks mRNA is safe\n\nto really think about why you think restructuring DNA\n\nis any way safe or healthy.\n\nmRNA, particularly mRNA in COVID vaccines,\n\nis not restructuring DNA.\n\nIn reality, every single one of your cells\n\nis producing mRNA at all times\n\nbecause that's how you make proteins.\n\nIn order to do that, DNA is converted\n\nthrough a process called transcription into RNA.\n\nAnd that RNA leaves the nucleus,\n\nthat's a one-directional process,\n\nthen it hooks up with a protein complex called the ribosome\n\nwhere it's converted into an amino acid sequence\n\nthat then folds into a protein.\n\nSo in the case of the mRNA vaccine,\n\nthat vaccine contains the mRNA sequence,\n\nin the case of COVID vaccines, for the spike protein.\n\nThat RNA hooks up with the ribosomes,\n\nand our cells create that spike protein,\n\nwhich then our immune system mounts a defense against.\n\nSo nothing ever enters or approaches the nucleus\n\nwhere our DNA is located to even change the DNA.\n\nPeople who still believe that the mRNA vaccines\n\ncan change DNA often cite this paper from 2022.\n\nThey look at the ability of an enzyme called LINE-1,\n\ninstead of going DNA to RNA, it converts RNA to DNA.\n\nAnd they say that the mRNA in the COVID vaccine\n\nis being converted into DNA.\n\nThey never show that any of that mRNA\n\never interacts with cellular DNA.\n\nBut beyond that, they're using a liver cell line,\n\nmeaning these are cells growing on a piece of plastic,\n\nand these are cancerous,\n\nmeaning they are not behaving normally,\n\nand they express this reverse transcriptase enzyme,\n\nwhereas our healthy cells do not.\n\nSo this model isn't biologically plausible\n\nin the way that these vaccines work in our bodies.\n\nNo other studies have shown anything similar,\n\nand we have orders of magnitude, higher data points\n\nwith actual human clinical data to show that mRNA vaccines\n\nare not changing our DNA, and they're safe,\n\nand they save millions of lives.\n\nIvan Loans asks,\n\nWhy do we have so many kids with diabetes?\n\nWe actually have very low rates\n\nof diabetes amongst children.\n\nOnly 0.35% of people under the age of 20\n\nhave diagnosed diabetes.\n\n86.6% of those are type 1 diabetes,\n\nwhich is an autoimmune disorder where the pancreatic\n\ninsulin-producing cells are destroyed.\n\n0.046% of people under the age of 20 have type 2 diabetes.\n\nThat's not a lot of children with diabetes.\n\nazurricat2010 asks, RFK Jr. removes all members\n\nof CDC panel advising U.S. on vaccines.\n\nHow is this beneficial to America?\n\nIt's not.\n\nThe Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices, or ACIP,\n\npreviously consisted of 17 members,\n\nall of whom were vetted very thoroughly before appointment.\n\nAnd they are an outside, impartial committee\n\nthat reviews FDA and CDC data.\n\nOnly ACIP-recommended vaccines have to legally be covered\n\nby your health insurance.\n\nWell, what RFK Jr. did was he removed all 17 members\n\nof the previous ACIP, and he replaced them\n\nwith eight people of his own choosing.\n\nAnd these include people like Robert Malone,\n\nwho you probably heard of during the COVID pandemic.\n\nBut since then, he's also said that people were hypnotized\n\nby mass-formation psychosis,\n\nthat COVID vaccines killed 17 million people.\n\nJust to be clear, all of those things\n\nthat Robert Malone has said are objectively false,\n\nand he is now one of the members of CDC's ACIP panel.\n\nAnother one would be Martin Kulldorff.\n\nHe was the co-author along, with Jay Bhattacharya,\n\nour head of NIH, of the Great Barrington Declaration,\n\nan opinion piece that basically said\n\nwe should just let COVID run rampant.\n\nYou also have Retsef Levi,\n\nwho has a PhD in operations management.\n\nIt has nothing to do with vaccine science,\n\nregulatory expertise, and he has repeatedly said\n\nthat mRNA vaccines cause serious harm, including death,\n\nespecially among young people.\n\nSo when you have these individuals\n\non what should be our leading advisory panel,\n\nyou can understand why that's not going\n\nto improve the health of Americans.\n\nWhenYoureStraaange asks, How can I avoid\n\nfalling into the traps of pseudoscience?\n\nIt can be really hard to discern pseudoscience,\n\nwhich maybe looks like science\n\nor uses science-sounding language,\n\nbut does not have evidence to support it.\n\nWatch for buzzwords instead of evidence.\n\nSo if you see claims about gut-healing,\n\nimmune-boosting, brain health,\n\nusually those are gonna be followed by products or claims\n\nthat don't have clinical evidence to support them.\n\nCheck your source, but then also check your source's source.\n\nPubMed is often used because it's a repository\n\nof peer-reviewed papers.\n\nBut it's not a fact checker.\n\nIt's basically like a library\n\nthat's storing all these papers,\n\nand it doesn't automatically score them\n\nfor whether they're reliable,\n\nwhether they've been reproduced.\n\nThe best way to be able to discern what's real\n\nand what's not is to go to a trusted expert in that field.\n\nBecause scientists and scientific experts are trained\n\nto pick apart these studies and understand whether\n\nwhat they're saying is actually supported by their data.\n\nThere's never going to be a situation\n\nin which a single paper is going to disrupt\n\neverything we know about a given scientific topic.\n\nAnd if that were the case, it would not be circulated\n\nby a popular press article.\n\nIt would be something that would be\n\ntaking the scientific field by storm.\n\nWasteofspace778 wants to know,\n\nWhat is the obsession with glucose spikes?\n\nThe wellness industry have created this notion\n\nthat non-diabetics should be tracking, monitoring,\n\nand trying to manipulate their blood glucose levels\n\nby wearing what's called a continuous glucose monitor.\n\nIt tracks blood glucose levels after you eat,\n\nbefore you eat, and so on and so forth.\n\nDoing this is not going to offer you\n\nany sort of health benefits\n\nif you don't have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n\nNon-diabetic people typically have blood glucose levels\n\nthat range between 80 and 140 grams per deciliter of blood.\n\nThroughout any given day,\n\nyou're gonna have fluctuations within that range.\n\nYou don't actually have to monitor it\n\n'cause your pancreas is already doing it.\n\nCasey Means, for example, founded the company Levels\n\nwhere she sells a continuous glucose monitor\n\nand a list of supplements and a recipe book,\n\nand it costs several hundred dollars a month\n\nto kind of stay on the subscription plan\n\nthat she claims is going to improve your overall health.\n\nThe Glucose Goddess recently launched a supplement\n\nthat she calls Anti-Spike.\n\nThere have been studies where they tracked non-diabetics\n\nwearing continuous blood glucose monitors.\n\nIn 99% of the cases, the blood glucose levels\n\nwere always within that normal excursion range.\n\nThere has been no clinical data that suggests\n\nthat wearing this or trying to reduce the number\n\nor range of these blood glucose excursions\n\nis offering any sort of health benefit.\n\nIt's not preventing the development of diabetes.\n\n@RobertKennedyJc, a commentary account, says,\n\nWhen JFK was in the White House, America was strong,\n\nhealthy, and full of energy,\n\nfree from today's epidemic of chronic disease.\n\nSince then, illness has skyrocketed, draining our vitality.\n\nLet's make America healthy again.\n\nJFK was in the White House in the early 1960s.\n\nSince then, we've actually improved health in a lot of ways.\n\nSee these really thick bars,\n\nthe most predominant causes of death in the early 1900s?\n\nThese were infectious diseases.\n\nTuberculosis, pneumonia caused by bacterial infections\n\nand influenza, respiratory viruses, and viral diseases,\n\nand gastrointestinal infections.\n\nThese are all gone from our causes of death\n\nin the U.S. today, and that's because of vaccines,\n\nsanitation, water treatment, antibiotics,\n\nthe ability to do surgeries\n\nin aseptic environments, blood transfusions.\n\nToday, we deal with mostly diseases associated with aging.\n\nHeart disease, things like atherosclerosis,\n\nheart blockage, cancers,\n\nand cancers are hundreds of different diseases\n\nwith a median age of onset of 60 years old.\n\nSo when we were dying in our 40s, in our 50s,\n\nwe were not living long enough for cancers to even develop.\n\nAnd then we're also dealing with accidents\n\nas a leading cause of death.\n\nWhen were we healthy in these people's estimation?\n\nWhen life expectancy of humans was 47,\n\n31% of those deaths were in children under five.\n\nWell, that was what it was like in the 1900s.\n\nPenicillin, the very first antibiotic,\n\nwas not available until 1945.\n\nSo it might be really appealing to romanticize\n\nback in the day, but the reality is we're living longer,\n\nhealthier, more vital lives today than we were\n\nwhen JFK was in the White House.\n\n@u_dnt_get_it_85 wants to know,\n\nWhat's your take on germ theory denialism?\n\nGerm theory denialism is the false belief\n\nthat diseases are not caused by viruses,\n\nbacteria, fungi, and so on.\n\nThis belief started in the 1800s\n\nby a gentleman named Antoine Bechamp,\n\na counterpart to Louis Pasteur, the founder of germ theory.\n\nAnd Antoine Bechamp believed in something\n\ncalled terrain theory, in that your environment\n\nand your overall physiology determined\n\nwhether you would become sick or not.\n\nIf you're healthy, you won't get measles.\n\nOr if you were taking the right supplements,\n\nyou won't develop cancer.\n\nBut unfortunately, our bodies are a lot more complicated\n\nthan that, and we know these microorganisms\n\nthat cause many of these infectious diseases,\n\nand because we know them, we can either treat them\n\nor we can prevent them through vaccination.\n\nAnd so the fact that there are still people\n\nthat promote this, people like Joe Rogan and Bill Maher\n\nand RFK Jr. and many of their allies,\n\njust goes to show that there's no amount of scientific data\n\nthat's going to get people to concede that their beliefs\n\nand their strongly held opinions are wrong\n\nbecause we've been collecting this data\n\nfor over 200 years now.\n\nSunflowerSeedsO wants to know, Are IV lounges,\n\ndrip bars, therapies a scam?\n\nYes.\n\nJust like all dietary supplements,\n\nIV dietary supplements are also unregulated,\n\nmeaning they do not have to have evidence\n\nof efficacy or even safety.\n\nIV bags can contain some vitamins that you maybe need,\n\nbut they also can contain a lot of things\n\nthat you may not even know.\n\nYou're now allowing an untrained person\n\nin a med spa to put an IV line directly into your vein,\n\nwhich opens the door for opportunistic infections.\n\nWhile many people report feeling better\n\nafter receiving an IV drip at one of these bars,\n\nusually it's because they're getting hydration,\n\nnot because this mystery cocktail of supplements\n\nis offering any sort of health benefits.\n\nEat a healthy diet, eat your fruits and vegetables,\n\nand if you're feeling dehydrated,\n\nmaybe drink some Pedialyte instead.\n\nmirawaaa wants to know, How to convince your family\n\nthat these vaccines are safe?\n\nPlease help.\n\nThe risk of getting into an accident in your car\n\nare actually orders of magnitude higher\n\nthan the risk of an adverse event from a vaccine.\n\nMild adverse events are what we call reactogenicity.\n\nThose are signs that your immune system\n\nis doing what it's supposed to do.\n\nSwollen lymph nodes near the vaccination site,\n\na low-grade fever, some fatigue, sore arm.\n\nSerious adverse events happen very rarely,\n\nless than one time out of every 100,000 doses of a vaccine.\n\nAnd very serious adverse events,\n\nlike an anaphylactic allergic reaction,\n\nhappen around one in 1 million doses of a vaccine.\n\nSo these risks are incredibly rare.\n\nBefore the smallpox vaccine was developed,\n\nwe had over 110,000 cases of smallpox every year in the U.S.\n\nSmallpox had about a 30% mortality rate.\n\nSolely because of the smallpox vaccine,\n\nwe have eradicated smallpox from human existence.\n\nPertussis caused about 175,000 cases\n\nof whooping cough every year.\n\nNow, because of the vaccine, we've reduced it by 89%.\n\nMeasles used to cause millions of deaths globally\n\nevery single year before the measles vaccine,\n\nbut the vaccine globally has reduced measles by 99%.\n\nUnfortunately, because of refusal to vaccinate,\n\nwe're now seeing reemergence of measles.\n\ngodless_mom wants to know, Acupuncture.\n\nWe've had a discussion in our parenting group on Facebook.\n\nSome say it worked for them,\n\nothers arguing from the side of science.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nWhen you look at robust randomized and blinded\n\nclinical studies, the effect most people are reporting\n\nis more placebo than therapeutic benefit.\n\nNow, it's important to note that acupuncture\n\nis a multi-billion dollar industry,\n\nand while insurance companies often do cover\n\nacupuncture treatments, it's not inherently\n\nbecause there's science to support it.\n\nIt's because there's a market for this practice.\n\nThere's no strong evidence that acupuncture\n\nis going to offer something\n\nthat science-based physical therapy\n\nor musculoskeletal rehab is going to offer you.\n\nBut people often report a benefit\n\nbecause they want to feel a benefit.\n\nBurtRigg asks, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says beef tallow\n\nis healthier than seed oils.\n\nIs he right? No, he's wrong.\n\nLike he is about most things.\n\nBeef tallow is a type of rendered fat derived from cows,\n\nand it is high in saturated fatty acids\n\nlike myristic and palmitic acid.\n\nWe actually have decades of robust evidence\n\nthat show that a diet high in polyunsaturated fats,\n\nlike those in seed oils, compared to a diet\n\nhigh in saturated fats, like those found in beef tallow,\n\nreduce your risk of heart disease, atherosclerosis,\n\nhigh levels of LDL cholesterol, that's the bad one,\n\nand triglycerides, and actually promote heart health.\n\nA lot of people have been misled to believe\n\nthat the process of extracting oils from seeds is harmful\n\nor it's leading to toxic substances in the seed oils.\n\nAnd that's just objectively false.\n\nThese oils are purified, and any sort of materials\n\nthat are used for the extraction\n\nare not present in the seed oil.\n\nAnd finally, some people claim that seed oils\n\nare inflammatory because when they're heated\n\nat really high temperatures,\n\nthey generate these harmful byproducts.\n\nThese seed oils would have to be heated\n\nto well above 400 degrees Fahrenheit for any of these\n\npotentially harmful byproducts to be generated.\n\nAnd that's not going to be happening\n\nif you're cooking with them or using them in your foods\n\non a day-to-day basis.\n\nSome people promote the use of beef tallow for skincare,\n\nand this all hearkens back to this appeal to ancestry,\n\nbecause the ancestors used beef tallow,\n\na false belief that natural chemicals are better.\n\nAnd so beef tallow, it's a natural fat,\n\nit must be good for your face.\n\nBut science has given us knowledge\n\nof all of these different molecules\n\nthat help to hydrate your face,\n\nreduce aging signs, things like sun damage.\n\nBeef tallow is not gonna replace that.\n\nUwStudent98210 asks, Anybody heard of chlorine dioxide?\n\nYeah, so chlorine dioxide is the same thing\n\nas Miracle Mineral Solution.\n\nThis was promoted by a guy named Jim Humble,\n\nwho was a Scientologist, and he wrote a book\n\nin the early 2000s called, The Miracle Mineral Solution,\n\nwhere he essentially told parents\n\nthat they should feed their children\n\nthis chemical chlorine dioxide.\n\nNow, chlorine dioxide colloquially\n\nis known as industrial bleach.\n\nEven at a relatively low dose,\n\nit can cause severe complications and health issues,\n\nincluding nausea, vomiting, kidney failure.\n\nIt can also interfere with their ability\n\nto transport oxygen,\n\nand it can also cause severe GI distress.\n\nIf you inhale it, it can cause pulmonary edema\n\nor fluid filling in your lungs.\n\nHowever, you have wellness influencers\n\nwho tout it as a cure-all for autism, HIV, cancer.\n\nAll of our scientific and regulatory agencies\n\nexplicitly warn against the use of chlorine dioxide\n\nfor any therapeutic use.\n\nThe problem is, is because this falls into this loophole\n\nof wellness products, people are still able\n\nto find chlorine dioxide,\n\nwhether through industrial chemical supply\n\nor through wellness companies,\n\nand they're using it to cause harm\n\nto themselves or to other people.\n\nric4100 asks, Why are we injecting newborns\n\nwith a vaccine for a disease they can't catch?\n\nSo this is referring to the hepatitis B vaccine,\n\nwhich is given to newborns.\n\nAnd Ric, they can catch hepatitis B.\n\nContrary to the claims of anti-vaccine activists\n\nand our recent surgeon general nominee, Casey Means,\n\nhepatitis B is not just a sexually transmitted infection.\n\nThe hepatitis B virus is spread to children perinatally,\n\nso during the process of birth,\n\nor through direct contact with any bodily fluids,\n\nusually from a close family member.\n\nHepatitis B infection in childhood\n\nleads to chronic hepatitis in 90% of the cases.\n\nAnd chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B\n\nis the cause of 60% of all liver cancers.\n\nSo you would think that knowing that we could prevent\n\n90% of chronic hepatitis cases in kids\n\nand all the subsequent liver cancers that would result,\n\nwe would be shouting from the rooftops, This is great,\n\nwe're preventing chronic illness, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nUnfortunately, because this has become this battle cry\n\nof anti-vaxxers that we're harming all these newborns\n\nby giving them this vaccine.\n\nBut we didn't always vaccinate against hepatitis B at birth.\n\nIn the 1980s, we had thousands and thousands\n\nof hepatitis B infections every year.\n\nBut in 1991, the U.S. adopted\n\na universal newborn vaccine recommendation,\n\nand since then, we have reduced the prevalence\n\nof chronic hepatitis B to less than 0.1%\n\namong kids under five.\n\nAcute hepatitis B infections themselves has declined by 82%,\n\nand it is incredibly safe and effective.\n\nnzt48nootropics wants to know,\n\nWhy does everyone swear by lion's mane?\n\nLion's mane is touted in the wellness spheres\n\nas a cognitive performance enhancer,\n\nthat it's going to improve focus,\n\nit's gonna improve brain function.\n\nThe problem is, all the evidence to suggest\n\nthose sorts of things have been done in mice\n\nor in cells growing on a piece of plastic.\n\nThere's no actual evidence in humans\n\nthat lion's mane supplements are actually offering\n\nthose sorts of cognitive or brain health benefits.\n\nYou'll often find lion's mane mixed in a cocktail\n\nalong with instant coffee.\n\nAnd so they'll say that the lion's mane\n\nis boosting your focus, but they ignore the fact\n\nthat coffee, which has caffeine,\n\nactually improves your focus.\n\nNow, lion's mane is an edible mushroom,\n\nand mushrooms are a great part of a healthy diet.\n\nBut don't be misled to believe that it's a miracle panacea\n\nthat's gonna somehow reverse normal aging of your brain\n\nor improve your cognitive function,\n\nbecause the data just aren't there.\n\nbrand_air asks, Is it really that bad to eat at night?\n\nFood is food, right? And besides, it's daytime somewhere.\n\nI mean, the earth is forever rotating,\n\nso late night eating could be daytime at any time.\n\nOur bodies function on a circadian rhythm,\n\nmeaning we have these 24-hour sleep-wake cycles.\n\nDuring the day and through the night,\n\nyou have different levels of certain hormones\n\nand signaling molecules that can alter\n\nor change processes that are occurring in your body.\n\nIn the evening, people generally have a little bit\n\nreduced insulin sensitivity, meaning if you ate\n\nthe same exact thing at night that you did\n\nmaybe first thing in the morning,\n\nyour normal blood glucose excursion\n\nmight be slightly higher, but still normal.\n\nIt's not gonna be super impactful.\n\nThe reason that some people experience weight gain\n\nor issues with eating late at night\n\nis because the quality of the food they're eating\n\nis generally calorie-dense, not nutrient-dense.\n\nSo they're eating an excess number of calories\n\nbeyond what they should be eating\n\nfor their overall metabolic rate.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nRemember, always verify your sources.\n\nTake every piece of information you come across\n\nwith a grain of salt.\n\nSensational claims always get more attention\n\nthan the more nuanced reality.\n\nThanks for watching Pseudoscience Support 3.\n\n[upbeat music]", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"know\", \"questions\", \"glucose\", \"dont\", \"cells\", \"going\", \"scientist\", \"hepatitis\", \"theyre\", \"pseudoscience\", \"biomedical\", \"health\", \"answers\", \"wants\", \"actually\"]", "content_hash": "73a216071b9c6544f8e612df4cf13f0abbbe09f7c97e58b6e4d6f9626e9bf814", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:54:02.347152+00:00"}

Sure.\n\nCathy Moriarty.\n\nMaybe, like, 40 times each by the time I was 10.\n\nAnd then also old-timey stuff,\n\nlike, weirdly, like, Bette Davis and stuff.\n\nSo, I mean, I just assume.\n\nYeah, you've got\n\na Bette Davis thing. That people talk funny.\n\nYeah, yeah. As I move through the world,\n\nI can now see it's weird, right?\n\nIt's too late to stop.\n\nAlso, I get nervous, and so it gets weirder all the time.\n\nI'm not doing it on purpose if it's any consolation,\n\nand I'm sorry for it.\n\nActually, you know, my dad is Bugsy Siegel,\n\nso that might be what you're hearing.\n\nI would buy that. How much?\n\nDoes that mean if I wanna play Bugsy Siegel,\n\nI have to go to you for the rights?\n\nListen, baby, if you wanna do\n\nthe Bugsy Siegel Tai Chi picture, we can talk about it.\n\n[Sam laughing]\n\nI know it seems crazy.\n\nDid Bugsy do?\n\nWe got more questions.\n\nDon't put that down. As you were, sir.\n\nWe're tech avail.\n\n[tape tearing] What series\n\nwas Natasha Lyonne in?\n\nCo-created Russian Doll.\n\nThat was a big one. Russian Doll.\n\nThe big East Village one.\n\nOrange Is The New Black with Danielle Brooks.\n\nWho were you? I directed an episode\n\nof Awkwafina's show.\n\nRussian Doll is closest to my heart.\n\nYeah, that's the one that I got\n\nmost lost in the sauce in the edit,\n\nand Pink Floyd, and what's it all about, Alfie?\n\nAnd you got to shoot it in the hood.\n\nYou got to shoot it in the East Village.\n\nI do like walking to work and night shoots.\n\nYou like night shoots?\n\n[scoffs] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Listen, ever since\n\nyou accepted the role of Bugsy Siegel is Tai Chi,\n\nI just feel like you've changed\n\nand become a boring person. I hope there's not\n\na bunch of night shoots for Bugsy Siegel Tai Chi.\n\nAh, I can't help it.\n\nI hope there're splits.\n\nOkay, we'll make 'em split.

Ah,\n\nlet's go Billboards, baby.\n\nThat was a fun role.\n\nIt's a lot going on with that role.\n\nHe's a bad guy,\n\nand then he learns the path to sort of,\n\nI don't know, spirituality.\n\nDid you love Martin McDonagh?\n\nI loved Martin McDonagh.\n\nFrances McDormand? I love Frances McDormand.\n\nDid you get an Oscar for that?\n\nZeljko Ivanek.\n\nI got, yes, I got the gold dude.\n\nAnd I'm so sorry, where is that Oscar right now, Sam?\n\nDo you have eyes on it?\n\nI tie it to my toothbrush\n\nso that I never- Oh God, that seems sensible.\n\nYeah.\n\nI'm never without it, so I'm always reminded.\n\nMuch deserved.\n\nWell, it feels like you should have\n\nat least six or seven by now.\n\n[Sam] Sam Rockwell, Bad Guys.\n\nAnother sort of missing then.\n\nAnother strange question. These are just-\n\nSort a non-sequitur.\n\nYeah, they're just kind of free-associating now.\n\nI like Bad Guys, I like the franchise.\n\nI'm a fan.\n\nYou are so good in this movie.\n\nYou're so good.\n\nThat's very nice of you to say.\n\nI'm all right, but I mean,\n\nyou are so cool in this movie. You're so good.\n\nYou're pretty cool yourself.\n\nWell, you know. Thank you for saying that.\n\nHolistically.\n\nWe didn't get to work together in this one.\n\nWell, we have our whole Tai Chi project.\n\nWe're gonna have to do a Tai Chi rom-com.\n\nYes.\n\nBugsy Siegel meets Bugsy-\n\nMalone. Malone.\n\nYes. [chuckling]\n\nCracked it.\n\n[tape tearing] Sam Rockwell, Gong Show.\n\nI love you in this movie. Chuck Barris.\n\n[sighing] I love you in this movie.\n\nConfessions of a Dangerous Mind.\n\nGeorge Clooney directed the shit outta that movie.\n\nGod, you're so good in it.\n\nClooney gave me a video camera.\n\nHe told me to go follow Chuck Barris around,\n\nand I basically, practically lived\n\nwith Chuck Barris and his wife.\n\nI've watched that movie- And Rutger Hauer\n\nwas in that movie.\n\nI got to work with Rutger. Oh, from Blade Runner?\n\nHauer.\n\nWow. Yeah, along with\n\nJulia Roberts and Drew Barrymore.\n\nOh, and she's so great.\n\nOkay.\n\nSam Rockwell. [tape tearing]\n\nIron Man Two.\n\nTwo, yes.\n\nFun, fun gig.\n\nIt was like making an independent movie, actually.\n\nMe and Mickey Rourke, we were oddly shooting it in sequence.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nSo we'd be like, let's add Mickey's parrot.\n\nHe said, I want my parrot.\n\nHe always wants his parrot.\n\nThat's Mickey. He wants his\n\nfucking parrot in the movie\n\nso we put the goddamn parrot in the movie.\n\nYeah.\n\nI heard Darren Aronofsky had to get the parrot\n\noutta the entire Wrestler.\n\n[Sam laughing] Shot by shot.\n\nThey spent the entire budget on it.\n\nThe fucking parrot was wrestling for fuck's sake.\n\nLook. On steroids.\n\nI mean, come on, the guy's good at what he does.\n\nJesus Christ.\n\nBut I wouldn't be in that movie\n\nif it wasn't for Justin Theroux and Jon Favreau, yeah.\n\nI was texting with Justin.\n\nYou know, he was on Poker Face recently.\n\nYeah.\n\nI was texting with him. Oh, he was?\n\nYesterday, and he was talking\n\na lot of shit about you, Sam.\n\nHe was?\n\nYeah.\n\nHe was saying, what'd he say?\n\nHe said, That guy can't do splits.\n\nNever spent not one day with Chuck Barris.\n\nI'm gonna Tai Chi his ass.\n\nYou're gonna.\n\nGetting him back.\n\nAh, flingsy wingsy.\n\n[card thudding] [Sam chuckling]\n\nNatasha Lyonne [tape tearing]\n\nhave Instagram?\n\nMe have Instagram?\n\nBig time.\n\nOn there 29 hours a day.\n\nSee me there.\n\nWho does Natasha Lyonne [tape tearing]\n\nplay in New Girl?\n\nI remember, Gretchen.\n\nNext.\n\nOkay.\n\nCan Natasha Lyonne swim?\n\nWhy would you wanna know this?\n\nWhy would they ask? Okay, first of all,\n\nnobody loves swimming more than me.\n\nWhy do we need to know this? Other than\n\nBurt Lancaster in The Swimmer.\n\nAh, good reference. I mean, that's a movie.\n\nNatasha Lyonne [tape tearing]\n\nvoice acting.\n\nWell, Bad Guys 2.\n\nAnd now in theaters.\n\n[card thudding]\n\nBada bing, bada bang.\n\nAll right, here we go.\n\n[tape tearing] Boom.\n\nWhat is Sam Rockwell's three week rule?\n\nI see my beloved Leslie Bibb every three weeks, hopefully.\n\nOh, really?\n\nSometimes we had to break that rule, yeah.\n\nThat's actually really smart.\n\nYeah. What is\n\nSam Rockwell's monologue? [tape tearing]\n\nWe talking about White Lotus?\n\nIt's quite a monologue.\n\nCheck it out.\n\nWould you say that any dark, dirty stuff happens in there?\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nWhat does Sam Rockwell [tape tearing]\n\ndance to in Charlie's?\n\nAh, well, Gotta Give It Up, Marvin Gaye, yeah.\n\nCharlie's Angels, that's right.\n\nOkay, well, mission accomplished there.\n\nThere you go.\n\n[tape tearing] I see.\n\nAngels was here\n\nat the bottom. Good question.\n\nI thought maybe Charlie's was a dive bar,\n\nno offense. [Sam laughing]\n\nWhat is Sam Rockwell like in-\n\nReal life?\n\n[chuckling] He's a real bimbo.\n\n[card thudding] That is not true.\n\nSammy's one of the,\n\nI mean, he keeps- Is a real dummy.\n\nHe keeps our community together like nobody else.\n\n[both kissing] I love Sammy Rocks.\n\nWow, that's a nice thing to say.\n\nAnd it's true.\n\nI'm gonna get shy and put my sunglasses on.\n\nOh, and I guess I'll get shy and just-\n\nWow.

I study modern China.\n\nLet's answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is China Support.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nS-Sheepherder wants to know,\n\nWhat do westerners get wrong about China?\n\nWell, China's really big.\n\nThere's 19 countries around China,\n\nand so that big military\n\nthat China has is spread quite thin\n\nhaving to defend all of China's borders.\n\nOr the big economy, you have to feed one\n\nof the largest populations on the planet.\n\nYou have to maintain control over those people.\n\nThat all drains resources from the country\n\nand means just that it's much more complicated\n\nto analyze China.\n\nYou have both a lot of assets,\n\nbut also a lot of liabilities.\n\n@snoowlions wants to know, When did modern China start?\n\nLet's answer that with a timeline.\n\nLet's start in 1911 with the collapse of the Qing dynasty\n\nthat ends thousands of years off and on of imperial rule.\n\nChina then collapses into the warlord era,\n\nwhich is every bit as bad as it sounds.\n\nThen the Japanese in the 1930s\n\nreally step up their aggression in China,\n\nconquering big parts of it,\n\nand basically starting World War II in East Asia.\n\nThe Japanese are defeated in 1945,\n\nbut at that point, the Chinese Civil War comes roaring back\n\nbetween the Communists and the Nationalists.\n\nThe Communists win that Civil War in 1949.\n\nThey found the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong.\n\nChina initially sides with the Soviet Union in the Cold War,\n\nbut about halfway through,\n\nthey realize that the Soviets are actually their main enemy.\n\nThat paves the way for in the US President Richard Nixon\n\nto go to Beijing.\n\nAnd at that point, China and the United States\n\nbasically become allies in the rest of the Cold War.\n\nThe Soviet Union collapses in 1991\n\nand that sets the stage for the US and China\n\nto become major trading and investment partners.\n\nThat culminates in 2001\n\nwith China's entry into the World Trade Organization.\n\nBut especially after the 2008 financial crisis,\n\nyou start to see the United States\n\nand China looking at each other more like rivals\n\nfeeling like their economies are under strain\n\nand that the trade relationship\n\nis not working out as well as they had hoped.\n\nAnd that really paves the way\n\nfor the era that we're currently in,\n\nwhich is one of tremendous hostility\n\nbetween the United States and China.\n\nhecubiss asks, Why would China even want to invade Taiwan?\n\nSo first of all, Taiwan is the seat\n\nof a rival Chinese government that is democratic,\n\nessentially tied security wise to the United States.\n\nAnd so if you're the Chinese Communist Party\n\nand you insist that this is all your territory,\n\nyou can't have this renegade regime\n\ngoing in a different direction.\n\nTaiwan is where the nationalists fled to\n\nwhen they lost the Chinese Civil War.\n\nSo they want to finish that job.\n\nIt's smack-dab at the epicenter of the East China Sea\n\nand the South China Sea\n\nwhere about half of world trade flows through.\n\nSo this is probably, pound for pound,\n\nthe most strategic important waterway on the planet.\n\nAnd Taiwan itself is, you can see,\n\nthe center cork of what the Chinese call\n\nthe first island chain in East Asia\n\nthat runs from Korea and the Japanese islands\n\ndown through the Philippines.\n\nThese are all American allies.\n\nThey host American troops.\n\nChina has no California, it has no west coast.\n\nIts only coast is completely hemmed in by rival powers\n\nthat are allied with the United States.\n\nSmashing Taiwan and taking it over\n\nwould give China an unsinkable aircraft carrier\n\nin the most important waterways,\n\nand blast a hole, not just geographically,\n\nin the US alliance system in East Asia,\n\nbut really in the credibility of US alliances\n\n'cause no one would trust the United States\n\nif the US just let Taiwan go down.\n\nEvery single Chinese leader has said,\n\nIt's only a question of time.\n\nWe're gonna take Taiwan one of these days.\n\nXi Jinping has said that it's a situation\n\nthat cannot be passed down generation to generation,\n\nwhich some analysts worry means\n\nhe intends to do this on his watch.\n\nBW asks, Is there something America can learn from China?\n\nIs there something that they're doing right?\n\nChina is really good\n\nat mobilizing resources for national missions.\n\nFor example, China has installed more solar and wind power\n\nthan any other country.\n\nChina is the world's largest trade power in the world\n\nand has forged trade relationships\n\nwith the majority of the world's countries.\n\nAnd China has built infrastructure faster\n\nand on greater scale than any country in human history,\n\nthen just the miraculous development\n\nof bringing hundreds of millions of people\n\nfrom living on less than $2 a day\n\nto average disposable incomes of 5,000 to $10,000 a year.\n\nThat is a tremendous, almost miraculous undertaking\n\nthat China has been able to pull off.\n\nAnd I think that only comes\n\nfrom having a sense of national unity\n\nand a willingness to pool resources for national purposes.\n\nThe United States,\n\nit's a dynamic, open, decentralized system,\n\nbut the downside is it also generally does not mobilize\n\nits resources on a national scale and unify\n\nunless it's really confronted with a crisis\n\nlike a global war or a depression.\n\nSo there are areas of the United States\n\nthat are neglected in terms of infrastructure.\n\nThere are neighborhoods that could be built up.\n\nThere are education systems that are failing.\n\nAnd so that type of rallying resources and coming together\n\nis something that the US I think could look to to China.\n\nBut obviously you don't want to go too far\n\nbecause part of what allows China to do that\n\nis just a lack of civil and political rights\n\nfor the Chinese people.\n\n@greatshistorian asks, Who is winning\n\nthe current trade war between America and China?\n\nChina is very much an investment and export-driven economy.\n\nThis trade war is really bad\n\nfor a lot of those major export industries.\n\nThere's been lots of closures, especially in eastern China.\n\nThere's been mass layoffs even just in the short time\n\nthat this trade war has been going on.\n\nNow on the American side, the consumer market\n\nis roughly three times the size of China's.\n\nSo consumers are the ones\n\nwho are being hurt by this trade war\n\nbecause they're gonna have to pay higher prices for goods\n\nthat were manufactured in China.\n\nXi Jinping cares a lot less about GDP growth.\n\nHe cares about power\n\nand about developing self-reliant, strong industries.\n\nAnd if this trade war enables China to decouple\n\nand reduce its dependence on the West,\n\nI think he counts that as a win,\n\neven if it crimps economic growth in the short term.\n\nAnd for the United States under the Trump administration,\n\nthey similarly want to decouple from China\n\nbecause they view it as a national security threat.\n\nI see these two countries as having a distinct interest\n\nin trying to get away from each other economically.\n\nThese dependencies, they both seem\n\nto want to push those away.\n\nChaseTheTaco.\n\nSerious question. Is China truly a Communist country?\n\nI know it seems crazy\n\nif you look at the Shanghai skyline,\n\nyou fly in through the Beijing airport.\n\nThat is the gilded veneer\n\non the outside that's been built up.\n\nBut if you look at the super-structure of the economy,\n\nwhat's actually the driving force behind it?\n\nIt's a very strong state presence.\n\nAll of the land in the country\n\nis owned by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe energy industry, the banking sector is state-owned,\n\n90%+ of the financial assets flowing around the country,\n\nso these are all what Lenin called\n\nthe commanding heights of the economy.\n\nAnd it can produce incredible output.\n\nIt can produce shiny high-speed rail,\n\nit can produce gleaming skyscrapers.\n\nBut this is sort of like a new modern form\n\nof a communist system\n\nwhere you still have the party running the show economically\n\ninsisting on a one-party state\n\nand a dictator ruling over it all.\n\nTake Jack Ma, the former head of Alibaba,\n\nhas a major company in China,\n\nand he gave a speech a few years back criticizing the way\n\nthat the government was running the economy.\n\nHe had his wings totally clipped.\n\nHe was sent out to Tokyo,\n\nhe had his empire completely dismantled\n\nand now has basically had to come crawling back.\n\nYou've had many other billionaires simply just disappear.\n\nAnd so at the end of the day,\n\neven the high-flying titans of China's economy know\n\nthat their livelihoods depend very much\n\non their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party,\n\nwhich is why you see many of the top titans of industry\n\nin China in the National People's Hall\n\nduring these major conclaves sitting next to Xi Jinping\n\nbecause they're effectively part\n\nof the same-party system that he operates.\n\nDizzyMajor5 wants to know,\n\nWhat do the Chinese people think of Mao Zedong?\n\nIs he considered good or bad?\n\nThe standard answer taught in Chinese schools\n\nis that he was 70% right, but 30% wrong.\n\nHere's Mao as a young revolutionary.\n\nHe was a journalist for a long time.\n\nHe actually wrote a whole pamphlet in 1940\n\nabout democracy and freedom in China.\n\nOf course, once he becomes Chairman Mao,\n\na lot of that stuff goes away.\n\nThe 70% right was he unified the country\n\nwhich had been ripped apart by decades of civil war.\n\nHe instituted a mass education campaign\n\n'cause he wanted to lift China up.\n\nSo that led to widespread literacy.\n\nHe wanted women to be active participants\n\nin the labor force.\n\nNow, in terms of the bad, his so-called Great Leap Forward,\n\nwhich was this scheme\n\nto turn China into a superpower in just a few years,\n\ntook millions of peasants off of their farms,\n\nput them in communes,\n\nhad them melt down their pots and pans.\n\nAs a result, the food supply ran out\n\nand 45 million people starved to death\n\nor were beaten or shot along the way.\n\nAnd then in order to insulate and protect himself,\n\nhe then launched the Cultural Revolution\n\nwhere he basically turned\n\nthe Chinese people on the Communist Party\n\nto purge many of his rivals.\n\nThat probably killed another million to 2 million people.\n\nSo ruthless, brutal, but effective\n\nin terms of bringing China together,\n\nwhich for much of Chinese history has not been the case.\n\n@SuperCoach137 asks, How did the one-child policy\n\nwork out for China?\n\nIt resulted in several hundred million abortions\n\nwhen people, starting in the late 1970s,\n\nweren't allowed to have more than one child.\n\nYou'd be subject to massive fines,\n\nequivalent in some cases to a year or more of your income\n\nif you had a second child.\n\nIn the '50s and '60s, China had a massive baby boom\n\nbecause Mao Zedong wanted to turn China into a superpower.\n\nSo he encouraged Chinese families to have lots of children.\n\nSo then when China did a 180\n\nand implemented the one-child policy in the late 1970s,\n\nyou had this baby boom generation\n\ncoming into the prime of their working lives\n\nand they had relatively few children to take care of\n\n'cause they weren't allowed to have them\n\nand they had relatively few elderly parents to care for\n\nbecause so many of them end up dying\n\nin the famines and the Cultural Revolution.\n\nSo in the '90s and 2000s,\n\nyou had anywhere between 10 to 15 working-age adults\n\navailable to support every elderly retiree\n\nin China's population.\n\nThat's two to three times the global average.\n\nIt's five times what the United States currently has.\n\nAnd so as a result, China's population\n\nwas primed for economic productivity\n\nand demographers think that alone explains\n\nabout 25% of China's rapid economic growth\n\nover the last 30 to 40 years.\n\nThe problem for China is now the situation is flipping\n\nwhere that huge baby boom generation\n\nare retiring and falling onto the backs\n\nof this tiny one-child generation.\n\nThat 10:15 ratio is gonna collapse to 2:1.\n\nIn the 2030s, China's gonna lose somewhere\n\nlike 70 million working-age adults in the next 10 years\n\nand gain 130 million senior citizens.\n\nThat's gonna be catastrophic for China's fiscal balance,\n\nfor its economic productivity.\n\n@RightSideofMB says, Siri, what are Chinese ghost cities?\n\nGhost cities refer to entire apartment complexes, airports,\n\nshopping malls that are either mostly or entirely empty.\n\nAnd it's a result of China's economic model,\n\nwhich is very much about collecting the resources\n\nof the Chinese people under the state\n\nand then plowing them into certain industries,\n\nincluding into the real estate sector.\n\nIt works really well for an authoritarian government\n\n'cause it's easy to pay off cronies who own the companies\n\nthat are doing all of the building.\n\nThe problem is it runs amuck.\n\nThese companies, they're getting paid\n\nwhether the apartments are occupied or not.\n\nSo they build a bunch of stuff\n\nbut then people aren't moving into them\n\nand now that China's population is declining,\n\nthere is going to be ever-lowering demand\n\nfor a lot of this base infrastructure.\n\nMehmetTopal wants to know,\n\nHow much power does Xi Jinping hold personally?\n\nIs he an absolutist like Louis XIV or like Stalin?\n\nI'm gonna reserve a certain category\n\nfor divine-right monarchs like Louis XIV\n\nand distinguish that from Xi Jinping.\n\nSo Xi Jinping is probably\n\nthe most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.\n\nHe's made himself president of everything for life,\n\nbut at the end of the day, he's one guy.\n\nAnd so his ability to pay attention\n\nto everything that's going on in his vast sprawling country\n\nis inherently limited.\n\nSo the real estate crisis that's going on,\n\nhe's demanded that people be more frugal\n\nand not speculate on real estate,\n\nbut the market is kind of doing what it's going to do.\n\nAnd as a result, you still have that ongoing crisis.\n\nZero COVID.\n\nYou know, he locked down Chinese people\n\nin their apartments for months on end.\n\nAt a certain point the Chinese people had it\n\nand you saw protests emerging\n\nthat seemed to have encouraged Xi\n\nto back down and undo that policy.\n\nAnd he also has to worry about rivals in the party,\n\nwhich is why he's embarked on\n\nthis massive anti-corruption campaign, purging more than\n\na million senior CCP officials along the way.\n\nWe do know a bit about his backstory.\n\nHis father was a high-ranking official\n\nserving under Mao Zedong, but he was purged,\n\nand in fact, Xi himself and his family were purged\n\nduring the Cultural Revolution.\n\nXi was sent out to the countryside\n\nto basically dig a bunch of holes.\n\nHis father was humiliated,\n\nXi himself was denounced by his own mother,\n\nand his half sister died during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nIt's all speculation, but people think this may have had\n\na big effect on him and that's what he thinks of\n\nwhen he thinks of rule by the people,\n\nwhich may explain partially why he seems so committed\n\nto centralizing all power under himself\n\nand basically installing himself\n\nto the point that he's literally written himself\n\ninto the constitution\n\nand obligates other people in China\n\nto read what he calls Xi Jinping Thought,\n\nwhich is his own sort of philosophy\n\nabout how to guide the country.\n\n@nic_moneypenny wants to know,\n\nWhat was China's ultimate role in the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nWe don't know for sure\n\nbecause China, the government,\n\nhas gone to extraordinary lengths\n\nto cover up how COVID emerged\n\nand details about the virus.\n\nWe know that in late 2019, they basically got rid\n\nof a lot of their virus samples\n\nthat were related to coronaviruses.\n\nThey floated conspiracy theories\n\nthat a virus actually came to China from frozen food\n\nthat was imported from outside of the country\n\nand they didn't really allow international inspectors\n\nuntil very late.\n\nAnd even then, when the WHO came\n\nto try to figure out where the virus came from,\n\nit was a highly scripted,\n\nalmost sort of like North Korean tour around the facilities.\n\nAnd as a result, we just don't know where it came from.\n\nThe two major theories are that it either emerged\n\nfrom this wet market in Wuhan\n\nbecause of the animals\n\nthat were being eaten and slaughtered there.\n\nThe other major theory is that it emerged\n\nfrom the Wuhan Institute of Virology,\n\nwhich is China's premier place for studying coronaviruses.\n\nAnd we know the virus itself has certain features\n\nthat you really only see\n\nif it's been modified in a lab rather than naturally.\n\nThe bottom line is, we don't know,\n\nbut there's a lot of circumstantial evidence\n\nthat it was done in this lab,\n\nwhich is a center of not just Chinese research,\n\nbut of a multinational research attempt\n\nto analyze coronaviruses.\n\n@JerryDunleavy asks, Whatever happened to Tank Man?\n\nAnd how many people did the Chinese Communist Party murder\n\nat Tiananmen Square?\n\nSo what Jerry is referring to is that famous image\n\nof a man standing in front of several tanks\n\nthat are rolling into Tiananmen Square\n\nto run over demonstrators, mainly students,\n\nthat were protesting there in 1989.\n\nWe have no idea what happened to Tank Man,\n\nhe has never been heard of since.\n\nIt wasn't just a crackdown in Beijing and Tiananmen Square,\n\nthere were massive protests\n\nin basically every provincial capital around China.\n\nMore than 80 cities had mass demonstrations\n\nthat were then forcibly put down.\n\nAccording to the party,\n\nroughly 200 to 300 people were killed.\n\nBut most Western estimates suggest\n\nit was 10 times that amount.\n\nThe way that the Tiananmen Square protests\n\nare often portrayed is as a pro-democracy demonstration\n\nby the Chinese people.\n\nAnd certainly there were elements of that.\n\nA lot of the students in Tiananmen Square\n\nwere calling for more democratic governance.\n\nThey built a giant replica of the Statue of Liberty\n\nin the middle of Tiananmen Square.\n\nBut really the crisis starts\n\nand the reason why\n\nit spreads across the country was economic.\n\nThere was massive inflation.\n\nThis led to massive demonstrations.\n\nA lot of people weren't being paid\n\nfor jobs that they were employed to do by the state.\n\nAnd also keep in mind that communist regimes\n\nwere starting to crumble, especially across Eastern Europe.\n\nSo the tail end of the Cold War\n\nand this belief that the legitimacy,\n\nthe functioning of a communist system is under question\n\nand led to mass demonstrations\n\nand even a split among the elites\n\nin the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nSince then, now the Communist Party is very much,\n\nWe have to stay together.\n\nWe either stay together or we hang separately.\n\nI think that informs a lot of the emphasis\n\non repression put on in China today.\n\nMiltonMerloXD wants to know,\n\nHow does censorship work in China?\n\nSo there's an actual Propaganda Department,\n\nthat's what it's called in China.\n\nThey set guidelines about what is allowed to be said\n\nand what is not allowed to be said.\n\nIt's all pretty predictable.\n\nYou know, criticizing the Chinese Communist Party,\n\npromoting democracy, Western liberal methods\n\nare all kind of looked down upon and and squelched.\n\nWhat the regime then does\n\nis they have this vast great firewall\n\nto control the internet\n\nwhere they use a combination of artificial intelligence\n\nand then hundreds of thousands of people\n\nthat are actually working to monitor China's internet,\n\nwhich is partially sealed off.\n\nWhat the censors really go after\n\nis not so much people going off\n\nand mouthing criticism about the leader,\n\nbut much more about trying to organize politically,\n\nwhether it's a house church, or student group\n\nor anything where you get people together who can then talk\n\nand then rally and potentially grow their numbers,\n\nthat looks too much like the start\n\nof an alternative political party.\n\nAnd the Chinese Communist Party says, No.\n\nWe have a monopoly on power.\n\nWe're the only political party\n\nthat's allowed to be had in this system.\n\nAnd that seems to be what the censorship regime\n\nis primarily dedicated to squelching out.\n\n@mbateman says, Wait, China's domestic surveillance system\n\nis actually called Skynet?\n\nI know, it's kind of on the nose.\n\nIt is called Skynet.\n\nThe idea is that there's hundreds of millions\n\nof surveillance cameras\n\nthat have been set up around the country\n\nas if it's a net coming from the sky.\n\nChina has pioneered methods to take all of the images\n\nthat are being absorbed by these cameras\n\nand then use artificial intelligence\n\nand speech and facial recognition technology,\n\neven gait recognition,\n\nso how you walk can be identified.\n\nAnd at this point they're starting\n\nto export elements of this system to more than 80 countries.\n\nCuba, Pakistan, Cambodia\n\nhave all imported aspects of this system.\n\nAnd so some scholars think this is the emergence\n\nof a new type of authoritarian system\n\nthat seems to have a lot of advantages\n\nin terms of population control.\n\n@Spencemo_c asks, How does China's\n\nsocial credit system work?\n\nSo in addition to video cameras\n\nand speech and facial recognition technology,\n\nthe Communist Party has access to your financial statements,\n\nto your police record, your education,\n\nany kind of disciplinary action.\n\nAnd so what they've done is basically created\n\na dossier on every single citizen.\n\nAnd so what they can then do\n\nis instantly punish Chinese citizens\n\nby saying, Oh you, you jaywalked.\n\nThat's a point.\n\nAnd so now you're gonna have to pay more if you want a loan\n\nor you may not be able to travel as freely\n\nor it may take longer to get your passport\n\nwhen you go to a government office.\n\nThere essentially is like a score\n\nand sometimes they'll actually post names\n\nof people who have been blacklisted\n\nbecause they've committed certain crimes\n\nor they've been infraction of certain regulations\n\nencouraging people to report on each other.\n\nItsAllOver_Again wants to know,\n\nWhy is China so God-like in the world of manufacturing?\n\nWell, it's so God-like,\n\nbecause it's designed to be God-like.\n\nYou have an authoritarian system\n\nthat essentially obligates the Chinese people\n\nto put their life savings in a state-owned bank.\n\nThat means the government has tons of money,\n\na war chest that they can then deploy\n\nat what they call strategic industries.\n\nSo they've spent hundreds of billions of dollars\n\nevery single year for more than a decade.\n\nThat's 10 times what other rich countries\n\nin the OECD or the United States spend\n\nas a share of their GDPs.\n\nSo in for example, the electric vehicle sector,\n\nChina has spent about $230 billion.\n\nSemiconductors, biotechnology,\n\nall of these key strategic industries.\n\nAnd at the same time, many foreign companies\n\nhave sent over lots of investment and training.\n\nSo Apple, for example,\n\nhas spent about $275 billion in investment in China.\n\nThat's more than the Marshall Plan\n\nthat the United States used\n\nto help Europe recover from World War II.\n\nApple also trained millions of Chinese workers, 28 million,\n\nwhich is more than the labor force of California.\n\nAnd also a lot of this is determined by their geography.\n\nChina has a long coastline right in the heart of East Asia,\n\nwhich is the most economically dynamic region in the world.\n\nSo many of the world's supply chains\n\nflow through these waters.\n\nIn the 1970s and early 1980s, you had China setting up\n\nwhat they called Special Economic Zones,\n\nespecially in the Southeast and places like Shenzhen\n\nas well as in Fujian province.\n\nIn some industries,\n\nwhether it's electric vehicles or in rare earths,\n\nChina currently produces anywhere between 60 to 90%\n\nof the global market.\n\nAnd now China has ports lining up and down its coastline\n\nthat serve as export platforms essentially\n\nfor the rest of the world.\n\nIn addition, China has extremely low labor costs\n\nbecause several hundred million people\n\nfrom the poor provinces in the west,\n\nthey move to the richer east coast provinces\n\nto work in factories for very low wages.\n\nBut that provides essentially a bottomless source\n\nof cheap-but-effective labor\n\nfor China's manufacturing juggernaut.\n\nRoxi USA asks, What percentage of pharmaceuticals\n\ndoes the US import in from China?\n\nIn terms of antibiotics, basic antibiotics,\n\nit's upwards of 90% that include\n\nat least some ingredients that are made in China.\n\nAnd so this has become another national security threat\n\nwhere the United States worries\n\nthat China could potentially cut the United States off\n\nfrom basic pharmaceuticals\n\nif there's some kind of crisis over Taiwan.\n\nWhether China would actually do that remains to be seen.\n\n@toxiccowboy1 asks, Are we headed to war with China?\n\nIt's not completely out of the question.\n\nIn addition to the conflict over Taiwan,\n\nthere's also the risk of a war around the Philippines.\n\nThat conflict really stems\n\nover who controls the South China Sea\n\nwhere a lot of trade passes through\n\nwhere most of China's oil imports pass through.\n\nUnder international law,\n\nthe Philippines gets 12 miles out from their coastline\n\nthat is their territory,\n\nand then another 200 miles out from their coastline\n\nthat is their exclusive economic zone.\n\nChina says, No.\n\nThat is all, that's just all Chinese territory.\n\nAnd they've been building artificial islands there.\n\nThey've been turning them into military bases\n\nand they formed what they call a maritime militia.\n\nSo thousands of fishing boats, coast guard vessels\n\nand naval ships that are basically shoving other countries\n\nout of their exclusive economic zone\n\nand confining them\n\nto narrow bands along their own coastlines.\n\nThe Philippines took China to court in 2016,\n\nthe World Court, which ruled that China's historical claims\n\nto the South China Sea are null and void.\n\nAnd in recent years China's really been turning\n\nthe screw on the Philippines,\n\none, I think to invalidate that ruling\n\nand shatter its credibility,\n\nbut second, 'cause the Philippines\n\nhas started opening up new military bases\n\nfor the United States\n\n'cause they say, We need some protection from China\n\nso that we can have access to our territorial waters\n\nin our exclusive economic zone.\n\nThe Chinese have a saying,\n\nYou should kill a chicken to scare the monkeys.\n\nMeaning you should make a bloody example\n\nout of a relatively weak adversary\n\nto send a message to the more powerful ones.\n\nThe Philippines have very little\n\noffensive air or naval capability.\n\nSo you just have to worry that Chinese would look at them\n\nas a very juicy target; weak but symbolically important.\n\n@adamncheck asks, Is TikTok just a China app\n\nto make Americans do dumb stuff to get likes and views\n\nand keep us distracted while they take over?\n\nThe Chinese version of TikTok,\n\nyou're only allowed to use it for 15 minutes\n\nto an hour or so depending on your age and status.\n\nAnd they also try to insert educational wholesome content\n\nin addition to all the fun cat videos\n\nand everything else that people are watching.\n\nSo I think the Chinese know\n\nthat this system is maybe not the best thing\n\nthat kids should be spending all day on.\n\nTikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company.\n\nUnder Chinese law, ByteDance is required\n\nto hand over data to Beijing whenever\n\nand in however much it wants it.\n\nIt's like putting a Chinese spy balloon in your cell phone\n\nwith your biometric data,\n\neverything you've liked and disliked.\n\nThere's been studies done suggesting\n\nthat the algorithm in TikTok in the American version\n\nwas promoting certain views\n\nlike after the October 7th massacre in Israel,\n\nmore pro-Hamas views were being amplified\n\nor pro-Russian views on the Ukraine conflict.\n\n@NOYK1847 asks, If Russian bots exist,\n\ndo Chinese bots also exist?\n\nI think first of all,\n\nyou should look down at the comments in this video\n\nand you'll probably get a taste\n\nof whether there are any Chinese bots.\n\nChina, it's been well documented,\n\nit uses both bots\n\nas well as what is called a 50-Cent Army\n\nbasically has a bunch of mainly kids and young adults\n\nwho are paid 50 Chinese cents\n\nper internet post that they make\n\nto destroy, undermine the credibility of messages\n\nthat maybe cut against the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nIt's reported there's probably\n\nseveral hundred thousand people\n\nthat are essentially employed as internet trolls\n\nby the Chinese Communist Party, in addition\n\nto obviously using artificial intelligence and bots.\n\n@Psalm_Sixtynine asks, Why would China want Tibet?\n\nI think it becomes very clear\n\nwhen you look at a map of China\n\nand you can see that most of it\n\nis the highest mountains in the world, the Himalayas,\n\nand a lot of it is also desert.\n\nAnd so most of China's population is packed in here\n\nand they're desperate for water as well as strategic space\n\nto defend themselves against enemies.\n\nAnd so Tibet, which is in this area here,\n\nis highly strategic.\n\nFor one, a lot of the glaciers up in the Himalayas\n\nare where the major rivers of Asia start,\n\nboth flowing down into China\n\nas well as flowing down into Southeast Asia and into India.\n\nSo if China can control that territory,\n\nit controls the source of vital water supplies.\n\nAt the same time, China and India,\n\nwhich is now the most populous country on the planet,\n\nhave a longstanding rivalry,\n\nand Tibet is the high ground\n\nliterally looking down onto India.\n\nIn addition, the Chinese Communist Party\n\nessentially inherited the borders\n\nof the previous Qing dynasty empire,\n\nwhich included Tibet led by the Dalai Lama.\n\nAnd so when China took over Tibet and conquered it in 1951,\n\nthe Dalai Lama fled to India\n\nand has been running a government in exile\n\nin India ever since.\n\nThis next question is from TapestryGirl.\n\nMom says China could take over the United States\n\nbecause they own our debt.\n\nChina does own some US debt. It's in the 3 to 4% range.\n\nIt topped out at about 7% about a decade ago,\n\ngenerally in the form of treasury bills.\n\nAnd a lot of this emerges\n\njust from the economic relationship\n\nbetween the United States and China\n\nwhere China is exporting a lot of goods\n\nto the United States.\n\nAnd the United States will often pay for that,\n\nessentially with a piece of paper that says\n\nIOU in the form of a treasury bill.\n\nAnalysts have looked at whether\n\nthey could use this as a course of weapon\n\nand basically concluded\n\nthey'd be shooting themselves in the foot.\n\nThe value of that asset would suddenly plummet.\n\nJapan owns more US debt than China does.\n\nSo I don't think that this is a unique China thing\n\nor that they could use it as some type of weapon\n\nto coerce the United States.\n\nLet's take a question from Quora.\n\nIs modern China more influenced\n\nby Confucianism or Marxism?\n\nI would say both because they lead in similar directions.\n\nMarxism-Leninism stresses the idea\n\nof public or communal ownership of the means of production\n\nto produce wealth.\n\nThat is owned by the state in China.\n\nIt's led by what Lenin would call the vanguard party\n\nstaffed by a top leader that is making decisions\n\non behalf of the people.\n\nAnd that's consistent with certain elements of Confucianism.\n\nConfucianism obviously has a long lineage,\n\nthousands of years in China.\n\nConfucius, a philosopher who emphasized a natural harmony,\n\npeople knowing their place in society,\n\nthat everyone has a certain role to perform in that society,\n\nand that you have to have a benevolent leader\n\nthat leads on behalf of the people.\n\nThat obviously appeals very much\n\nto Chinese dynasties over the millennia.\n\nYou have Xi Jinping today grafting that on\n\nto a Marxist-Leninist structure of the party.\n\n@Gus_802 asked, What happened\n\nwith the Chinese spy balloon hysteria?\n\nIn January, 2023, the United States detected\n\na balloon floating over areas\n\nincluding a nuclear missile silo in Montana.\n\nWhat it was carrying\n\nwas all this advanced surveillance equipment\n\nthat was about the size of a regional jet airliner.\n\nSo we're talking about\n\na major piece of hardware floating around.\n\nChina's done this in more than 40 countries,\n\nin Japan, over Taiwan,\n\nthey've been floating balloons\n\neven over potentially over American bases in Europe.\n\nAnd there's a fear that China is testing out\n\nthis alternative surveillance system.\n\nBecause balloons emit almost no radar signature,\n\nthey're really hard to detect.\n\nThey hover around 60,000 feet, which is higher\n\nthan a commercial airliner but below satellites\n\nin this area where people really aren't looking.\n\nIt gives China eyes and ears over sensitive US sites\n\nthat otherwise they wouldn't have.\n\nThe US sent a fighter jet up eventually to shoot it down\n\nand then the US grabbed all of the technology that was there\n\nand observed the balloon's flight.\n\nThat might have actually helped US intelligence\n\nmore than Chinese intelligence.\n\n@all4stops asks, Who is winning the tech war\n\nbetween China and the United States?\n\nI think they are each dominating\n\ndifferent types of technologies.\n\nThe United States is still doing quite well\n\nin high-value areas.\n\nSo advanced computer chips, aerospace,\n\nthe complicated jet engines\n\nthat you need to fly a jumbo jet or a fighter.\n\nChina on the other hand dominates scale\n\ntaking existing technologies from other countries\n\nand then mass producing highly effective,\n\ncost-efficient electric vehicles,\n\nrun-of-the-mill computer chips,\n\nrare earths, pharmaceuticals, medical PPE.\n\nThere's so many areas where China\n\ncan just flood the market with sheer scales.\n\nBoth of those types of technologies\n\nare really important for a modern economy.\n\nThey're also very important for military power.\n\nSo each in their own way is sort of winning in some ways\n\nbut also has major vulnerabilities.\n\n@JoeBart85120716 asked, Does China own American farmland?\n\nYes, China does own American farmland.\n\nIt's like 0.05% of American farmland.\n\nBut some of this farmland is near American military bases,\n\nespecially Air Force bases\n\nincluding some of those where American strategic forces,\n\nnuclear forces could be taking off.\n\nAnd so there is a fear that if China has this land,\n\nthey can put things on it, explosives, missiles,\n\nthat could potentially attack American bases\n\nif there is some kind of major war\n\nand destroy US aircraft on the ground\n\nbefore they even get up into the air.\n\nWe don't know the details on that.\n\nYou'd have to get classified information,\n\nbut the amount of farmland is small,\n\nthe location is a little bit scary and questionable.\n\ncakeba asks, Can someone explain Hong Kong to me?\n\nSo Hong Kong was a British colony\n\nafter the first Opium War in 1839\n\nall the way up until 1997\n\nwhere Britain agreed to hand back Hong Kong to China\n\nand in exchange, China pledged to grant Hong Kong a, quote,\n\nHigh degree of autonomy.\n\n'Cause within Hong Kong there was a different rule of law.\n\nThere was an independent judiciary.\n\nSo you saw massive protests there\n\nover the last five or six years when China\n\nwas basically trying to erode a lot of those freedoms,\n\ncrack down on the press,\n\ncrack down on the free flow of investment,\n\nand also on the way\n\nthat the Hong Kong government is selected\n\nand the Chinese government passed national security laws\n\nthat made it possible for them to remove protestors,\n\ntake them to mainland China.\n\nSo at this point it seems like Hong Kong\n\nhas basically become another large cosmopolitan,\n\nbut ultimately Chinese city\n\nrun by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nIronLover64 asks, How does the quality of life\n\nfor the low class in China compare\n\nto that of the United States, let's say in a red state.\n\nSo why don't we compare the poorest of the poor in China\n\nto say average wages in Mississippi,\n\nwhich is the poorest state.\n\nFor China, roughly half the country\n\nis living on something like $5 to $10 a day.\n\nIn Mississippi, that's gonna be three\n\nto four times that amount.\n\nThere's a lot more obesity in a place like Mississippi\n\nthan there is in China.\n\nOn the other hand, in rural China\n\nyou have a severe problem of malnourishment\n\nand rudimentary healthcare.\n\nResearchers at Stanford went out\n\nand they found that roughly a third of rural children,\n\ntheir IQs are around 90, which is really low,\n\nbecause of malnutrition from a young age,\n\na lack of education.\n\nThe average education level is about an eighth grade\n\nor seventh grade level in rural China\n\n'cause high school costs money.\n\nAnd so a lot of Chinese families,\n\ntheir kids will just drop out of school.\n\nAnd the other issue is that your citizenship in China\n\nis tied to your locality.\n\nAnd so if Mom and Dad go\n\nto an eastern rich coastal province to work in a factory,\n\nthey can't bring their kids with them\n\n'cause they won't be allowed to go to school.\n\nSo they're just sending money back\n\nand maybe only seeing their kids\n\na few times or maybe only once a year.\n\nSo just in terms of the basic healthcare and education level\n\nand then just in terms of the amount of wealth\n\nthat someone in Mississippi might have\n\nversus someone in poor rural China,\n\nit's a very stark difference.\n\n@Captaintrips333 asks, What's going on\n\nwith the Uyghur Muslim population in China?\n\nSo there's about 10 to 12 million Uyghur Muslims.\n\nThey live mainly in a province called Xinjiang,\n\nwhich is in the western part of China.\n\nBasically since 2017,\n\nChina set up what they call reeducation centers\n\nor vocational education centers,\n\nwhat people in the West have called concentration camps,\n\nand what the US government deems an attempt at genocide\n\nand basically put in a million\n\nto a million and a half Uyghur Muslims,\n\nso a substantial part of the population, in these centers.\n\nWe've heard from people that have come out of them\n\nthat there's a lot of indoctrination, that they are enforced\n\nto renounce their heritage and to learn Mandarin\n\nand basically to assimilate with Chinese society.\n\nA big part of what the Chinese Communist Party is about\n\nis making sure a Soviet-style collapse\n\nnever occurs in China.\n\nAnd one of their theories\n\nabout why the Soviet Union broke apart\n\nwas that the Soviet Union\n\nwas like one of those Hershey chocolate bars\n\nthat's divided into little squares that you can break apart.\n\nIt was these disparate republics\n\nthat all went their own way when they suddenly could.\n\nSo there was a fear that a minority region like Xinjiang\n\nwhere these Uyghurs were living\n\nwas going to try to separate from the mainland\n\nor was gonna become a base of terrorism directed at China.\n\nSo unfortunately the Uyghur Muslims\n\nare experiencing severe repression right now\n\nunder the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nloefferrafael asks, Does China support\n\nor promote communism around the world?\n\nI don't think China's promoting communism anymore\n\nthe way that the Soviet Union\n\nused to bankroll revolutionary movements.\n\nThey have engaged in this Belt and Road Initiative\n\nwhere they've loaned out more than a trillion dollars\n\nto more than a hundred different countries,\n\nmainly so that those countries can employ Chinese companies\n\nto build infrastructure on their territory.\n\nSo whether that's building ports or roads or soccer stadiums\n\nor what the Chinese call smart city systems.\n\nThere's a port in Greece for example,\n\nthat is highly profitable,\n\nit's an important, valuable piece of infrastructure\n\nthat China helped fund and build.\n\nOne out of every three infrastructure projects\n\nin Sub-Saharan Africa over the last 20 years\n\nhas been built partially\n\nor entirely by Chinese companies.\n\nSo you see a massive spread of infrastructure\n\nand part of the reason really stems\n\nfrom the 2008 Financial Crisis\n\nand the resulting trade protectionism\n\nthat was emerging, backlash against Chinese products.\n\nThe Chinese decided, We need to open up new markets.\n\nWe can also get these countries more hooked\n\non our ecosystem of technology standards,\n\n5G networks, smart city systems,\n\nand that way we'll have dominant market share\n\nin a lot of these areas\n\nthat are gonna be really the growth of demand\n\nin terms of consumption going forwards.\n\nThey also bring that surveillance system\n\nthat allows would-be dictators\n\nto keep easier tabs on their populations.\n\n@ostenati asks, What happens when Xi dies?\n\nWho's next in line? And will they be good for China?\n\nI think chaos could potentially ensue\n\nbecause he has not designated a successor.\n\nHe's written himself into the constitution.\n\nHe's basically treated like a demigod\n\nin terms of Chinese propaganda.\n\nAnd if you look at the history\n\nof the Chinese Communist Party,\n\nthere has only been one completely orderly\n\nand peaceful transition of power.\n\nAnd that's when Xi himself came to power.\n\nAll of the previous leaders,\n\nit was a vicious power struggle\n\nand there were split authorities.\n\nSo for example, Deng Xiaoping is purged\n\nand then eventually comes back to power\n\nand has to put down his enemies and imprison them\n\nin order to take the helm.\n\nThen Jiang Zemin comes to power\n\nafter the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989,\n\nbasically 'cause the Party realizes\n\nit needs to unify behind a candidate\n\nor they're just gonna disintegrate.\n\nThen when Hu Jintao comes to power,\n\nJiang Zemin is not willing to give up a lot of his power\n\nand he keeps himself as commander in chief\n\neven after Hu Jintao becomes president\n\nand general secretary of the country.\n\nIt'd be like as if Joe Biden was still head of the Pentagon\n\nand the military and commander in chief,\n\neven though Donald Trump\n\nis now president here in the United States.\n\nIn other words, in Chinese politics\n\nit's very rough-and-tumble,\n\neven though it happens behind closed doors.\n\nChaos is entirely possible.\n\nAnd if you just look at the broad sweep of Chinese history,\n\nvicious power struggles tend to ensue.\n\nSome people hope that you'll get\n\na Chinese Mikhail Gorbachev,\n\nyou know, the Soviet leader who made nice with the West\n\nand liberalized a bit at home.\n\nI think you might actually get a Chinese Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt seems like the one thing\n\nthat everyone in the Chinese Communist Party can agree on\n\nis that the Chinese Communist Party\n\nshould continue to rule China in perpetuity.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nThanks for watching China Support.\n\n[upbeat music]", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"basically\", \"questions\", \"united\", \"think\", \"asks\", \"scientist\", \"chinese\", \"china\", \"answers\", \"communist\", \"chinas\", \"really\", \"political\", \"lot\"]", "content_hash": "95e91e955ad1082287579f3294d2a680d037b5122e35418ef5b812320e57a2a9", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:54:06.185945+00:00"}

"published": null, "text": "Transcript\n\nWhat is Area 51 actually used for?\n\nWell, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.\n\nNo, [laughs] just kidding.\n\nI'm Astrobiologist David Grinspoon from NASA.\n\nLet's answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Alien Support.\n\n[energetic music]\n\nDisgruntled Hermit asks,\n\nWhat's the most interesting exoplanet you've read about?\n\nIf I had to pick a favorite that we found so far,\n\nit would be the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system.\n\nThere are seven planets in the system that we've identified\n\nso far, and probably about three\n\nof them are potentially habitable.\n\nAnd by the way, the TRAPPIST system is\n\nonly 40 light-years away.\n\nWhich, if you consider that our galaxy is\n\na 100,000 light-years across, that's relatively close.\n\nI have a sort of chart here,\n\nand you can see the habitable zone of the TRAPPIST system\n\nwith several potential planets in it, compared\n\nto the habitable zone of our solar system on the bottom,\n\nwhich has Earth, and then you know, sort of possibly Venus\n\nand Mars on the edges of habitability.\n\nAnd by the way, the TRAPPIST system here,\n\nit's a cooler star than our sun.\n\nIt's a red dwarf, and so the planets are\n\nclustered very close.\n\nBut imagine what it would be like\n\nfor life evolving on a system\n\nwith multiple habitable planets\n\nnearby one another.\n\nMeteorites occasionally get blasted off\n\nof one planet and land on another.\n\nWe have pieces of Mars here on Earth.\n\nSo, if you have a habitable planet with life\n\nand another planet that could be habitable,\n\nyou could imagine life spreading easily.\n\nJabalandkie asks, Are aliens real?\n\nWell, my thought is that aliens are real.\n\nThere are probably something\n\nlike 30 billion habitable planets in our own galaxy.\n\nAnd so, even if a small fraction of those have an origin\n\nof life, there's lots of life in our galaxy.\n\nAnd the more we study Earth\n\nand its origins, we haven't found anything that's sort\n\nof magical or so special about Earth\n\nthat those things shouldn't be happening elsewhere.\n\nSo if you're asking me, do I think aliens are real, yes.\n\nIf you're asking me, do I know scientifically,\n\nI'll say not yet, but we're on the road to find out.\n\nHere's a question from Quora.\n\nHow accurate is 'Arrival' scientifically?\n\nI really like the movie Arrival.\n\nI'm watching this scene here\n\nwith this astrobiologist, glossed in wonder and awe,\n\nand a little bit of terror, encountering this alien.\n\nWe talk about convergent evolution.\n\nThat evolution on other worlds would find some\n\nof the same solutions.\n\nSo the idea that they have something that's like fingers\n\nfor grasping, that makes sense.\n\nThe idea that they would have this kind\n\nof symmetry just like we have bilateral symmetry,\n\nthey look vaguely squid-like, vaguely octopi,\n\nlike I wouldn't be surprised if we saw complex aliens\n\nif they looked somewhat familiar,\n\nbut not exactly like any organism we had seen before.\n\nBecause again, they'll be responding\n\nto the same overall kinds of evolutionary forces.\n\nAnd then you have the other factor where she's trying\n\nto communicate, and this alien is doing this weird kind\n\nof circular writing,\n\nand it turns out that they are trying to communicate with us\n\nand they're as equally puzzled by us.\n\nThat makes sense because I think there's this whole idea,\n\nsomething called incommensurability,\n\nthat it might really be hard to communicate\n\n'cause they might have very different kinds of cognition,\n\nvery different notions of reality and time.\n\nSo I find this alien very convincing.\n\nUtopia Circle asks, How exoplanets are discovered?\n\nYou can't directly observe the planet\n\nbecause they're too dim and too far away,\n\nbut you can notice what the planet is doing to the star.\n\nSo, as a planet orbits a star,\n\nbecause of the gravitational pull of that planet,\n\nthe star actually wobbles a little bit.\n\nSo that star is wobbling\n\n'cause there's a planet around it,\n\neven though you can't see the planet.\n\nSo, some of the time, the star is coming\n\ntowards your telescope, and some\n\nof the time, the star is coming away from your telescope.\n\nWe call that a Doppler shift.\n\nWhen it's coming towards you, the frequency shifts\n\nto a higher frequency, blue.\n\nWhen it's coming away from you, it shifts\n\nto a lower frequency red.\n\nAnd so, our instruments got good enough to detect\n\nthat slight change, that rhythmic change from blue\n\nto red to blue to red.\n\nIt's a very, very tiny shift in wavelengths.\n\nAnd that was the first sign.\n\nAnd then, later on, there was a new technique\n\nthat's called the transit method.\n\nWhen a planet passes directly in between you\n\nand the star, you can notice that little bit\n\nof dimming of starlight.\n\nIt's very tiny 'cause planets are small\n\ncompared to the star.\n\nBut if you have a very sensitive measurement of the light\n\nof that star over time, when a planet passes just in front\n\nof it, the star will dim a little bit.\n\nAnd so, if you watch the light curve over time of that star,\n\nit'll wobble up and down and up and down and up and down.\n\nSo you're not so much seeing the planet as noticing\n\nthat the planet is blocking the star a little bit,\n\ncausing it to periodically dim.\n\nIt only works when the geometry's right,\n\nif it's a little bit above or a little bit below,\n\nthe direct line between your telescope\n\nand that star, you'll miss it.\n\nSo only about 5%\n\nof stars have planets oriented in the right plane,\n\nthe right direction to use that transit method.\n\nBut when things are lined up right, it's very sensitive.\n\nSo that has allowed us now,\n\nespecially with space telescopes,\n\nlike there was an instrument called Kepler that was designed\n\nto use the transit method to find lots of exoplanets.\n\nAnd that was really what revealed to us\n\nthat most stars in the Universe have planets.\n\nSowhatvirgo asks, Where do astrobiologists work?\n\nHow hard is it to get a job in astrobiology?\n\nSo astrobiologists work a lot at universities.\n\nSome of them work in government labs.\n\nSome of us build spacecraft\n\nand send them out to observe other planets.\n\nSome of us do field work\n\nand study exotic locations, go on expeditions\n\nwhere there's extreme life to understand the limits of life,\n\nand look for some of the earliest signs of life.\n\nThis is a rock called a stromatolite.\n\nThis one comes from Western Australia\n\nand is about 2.7 billion years old.\n\nAnd if you look in close, you see this rock is made up\n\nof layers, and what we've learned is\n\nthat those layers are from ancient microbial mats.\n\nSome of the earliest life on Earth\n\nthat formed these layers on,\n\nwhat was then the C4 microbes, single-celled organisms,\n\nusing the energy of sunlight, using different kinds\n\nof nutrients flowing in the seawater,\n\nand organizing themselves into these layers.\n\nIm at your moms house, asks, What is taking NASA so long\n\nto find them aliens?\n\nWhat active missions are they doing?\n\nWell, it's a big Universe out there,\n\nbut we're working on it.\n\nObviously, we have rovers on Mars searching\n\nfor the signs of ancient life.\n\nSo, we have a mission now on its way to Europa, a Moon\n\nof Jupiter that is home to a vast ocean of liquid water.\n\nSo, we have a mission called Europa Clipper orbiting\n\nthe Jupiter system and making close passes\n\nby Europa in the early 2030s, helping us to understand\n\nif that ocean is habitable, what's the temperature,\n\nthe pressure, what are the flows of nutrients, and so forth.\n\nIs that ocean a place that could support life?\n\nAnd if it is, that would motivate us\n\nto send missions in the future\n\nthat would land on the surface,\n\nand maybe even tunnel under the ice in submarines\n\nto look directly for life on Europa.\n\nWe also have a mission called Dragonfly\n\nthat's going to launch in a few years and go to Titan.\n\nTitan is a moon of Saturn.\n\nIt has a thick nitrogen atmosphere like Earth's,\n\nand it's goaded with organic molecules, the same kinds\n\nof molecules that led to the origin of life on Earth.\n\nDragonfly is going to be basically a nuclear-powered drone\n\nthat lands on Titan,\n\nand samples the surface, examines those organic molecules\n\nto see if they're the kinds of molecules that may have led\n\nto life on Earth, and then it's going to take off\n\nand fly to different locations and repeat its experiments.\n\nSo, it's gonna be the first time we've actually been able\n\nto explore a planet with an aerial craft\n\nthat lands multiple places\n\nand does these kinds of experiments.\n\nWe had a mission recently that went\n\nto an asteroid called Bennu.\n\nIt collected over 100 grams\n\nof material from the surface of Bennu,\n\nand brought it back to Earth.\n\nSo we have, in our labs now, pieces of asteroid dirt,\n\nand what we found is that Bennu is full of the stuff\n\nof life, amino acids.\n\nAmino acids are the things, the building blocks\n\nthat make up proteins.\n\nAnd nucleotides, which are the components\n\nthat make up DNA and RNA.\n\nSo that's really exciting.\n\nIt suggests that not just Earth,\n\nbut all the planets, were being sprinkled with the stuff\n\nthat basically leads to an origin of life.\n\nSo, again, we haven't found life elsewhere,\n\nbut we've been finding results that suggest\n\nthat life should be common.\n\nX/x/.txt asks, Who came up\n\nwith the flying saucer design, and why did it stick?\n\nIt turns out that flying saucers go back\n\nto a pilot named Ken Arnold,\n\nwho was flying in the Pacific Northwest in 1947,\n\nand he reported something weird that he saw.\n\nWhat's interesting is\n\nthat he never even said it was saucer-shaped.\n\nHe didn't understand,\n\nand he described its motion as skipping like a saucer.\n\nI think it's like when you skip rocks or something,\n\nand it kind of bounces like that.\n\nThat's what he apparently meant.\n\nAnd then it got reported in a newspaper\n\nas Pilot sees mysterious flying saucer.\n\nAnd thus, a huge trope was born.\n\nPUGBUG2 from Reddit asks,\n\nHow did the first life form on Earth emerge?\n\nWe know something about the most primitive life forms\n\non Earth because we study modern organisms\n\nand how they're all related.\n\nThere's something called LUCA,\n\nthe Last Universal Common Ancestor.\n\nEven though we don't have an example of it,\n\nby seeing how different life forms have evolved from it,\n\nwe can reconstruct the properties\n\nof that Last Universal Common Ancestor.\n\nAnd so, we know that it liked hot conditions.\n\nWe know that it was a single-celled organism.\n\nWe have inferred that it occurred in a watery location.\n\nSome people think sea floor vents.\n\nSome people think tidal areas, little ponds\n\nthat were being wet and dried or freeze,\n\nand thawed would've led to the right kinds of chemistry.\n\nWe also have experiments that show that the building blocks\n\nof life are very easy to create.\n\nIf you mix gases that were in the primitive atmosphere,\n\nthen you spark them with energy sources\n\nthat were likely present,\n\nlightning, ultraviolet light from the sun.\n\nYou easily create these molecules like amino acids\n\nand other chemicals that clearly were important\n\nfor the origin of life.\n\nYou had gradual increases in chemical complexity.\n\nYou probably had the formation\n\nof very simple membranes which separate inside from outside,\n\nand allow the creation of cells.\n\nThere are certain chemicals which you put 'em in water\n\nand they create membranes.\n\nWe call 'em vesicles.\n\nWe know the necessary chemistry, we know what some\n\nof the earliest life was like.\n\nWe sort of were closing in on it from multiple directions.\n\nNext question. WinddancerLor.\n\nWTF happened to Ceres?\n\nCeres is a dwarf planet.\n\nIt's basically one\n\nof the largest objects in the asteroid belt,\n\nbut we call it a dwarf planet\n\nbecause it's large enough to be rounded by gravity.\n\nAnd recently, we sent a spacecraft there,\n\nand we found some surprising things.\n\nMost surprising, you see this large crater\n\nin the center of this image.\n\nIt's bright and white,\n\nand what we found is that's a salt deposit.\n\nAnd that salt deposit indicates that there was water.\n\nAnd it suggests that this was a water world at one point,\n\nand may still even have liquid water on the inside.\n\nThis is very exciting to astrobiologists\n\nbecause it means that dwarf planets like Ceres are places\n\nwhere you could have, in the past,\n\nhad habitable conditions on the inside.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe at present, some\n\nof these dwarf planets still have habitable oceans.\n\nSo the more we explore the solar system,\n\nthe more we're surprised by the level of activity on some\n\nof these worlds that we thought were dead.\n\nNew Language4727 asks,\n\nAre there good scientific explanations\n\nfor UFO sightings,\n\nsuch as the USS Nimitz encounters in 2004?\n\nThere are some intriguing reports,\n\nand the USS Nimitz one is rather strange.\n\nYou know, the ocean boiling some object\n\nthat didn't look like a human-made object,\n\nseeming to fly at great speeds, and so forth.\n\nI don't know how to explain it, but the bottom line is,\n\nand we see no reason to think this has anything to do\n\nwith astrobiology, or any kind\n\nof extraterrestrial technology.\n\nOne of the videos that was recently popularized was taken\n\nby pilots.\n\nIf you look at that video,\n\nit does look like something's moving,\n\nsort of, unnaturally fast.\n\nBut it turns out if you analyze information we do have,\n\na lot of that can be explained by parallax.\n\nThat is the motion\n\nof the camera can make something look like it's moving\n\nmuch faster than it is.\n\nSo, people that have actually looked at the data said,\n\nYou know what, the speed isn't as great,\n\nand the motion isn't as unnatural as we thought.\n\nBut you know, I'm the first to admit\n\nthat there are things in our atmosphere\n\nthat we don't understand.\n\nBut as of now, I've not seen anything that tells me, aha,\n\nthis is an extraterrestrial mystery.\n\nIt's more like, this is a plausible terrestrial mystery,\n\nbut we don't know very much about it,\n\nand we don't have very good documentation.\n\nAshkir asks, What is\n\nthe closest another habitable planet could be near Earth?\n\nIt's probably, roughly, four light-years,\n\nthat is Proxima Centauri,\n\nwhich is in the nearest star system to Earth,\n\nwhich, again, for perspective,\n\nthe galaxy is about 100,000 light-years.\n\nSo, four light-years on the scale\n\nof the galaxy is very close.\n\nOf all the spacecraft we've launched, there are five of them\n\nthat are on trajectories\n\nwhere they will actually escape our solar system.\n\nAnd most famously, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are\n\non their way out,\n\nand they will maybe encounter another star system\n\nin something like 100,000 years.\n\nBut, of course, it would be millions of years\n\nbefore one of them actually sort\n\nof wandered into the vicinity of a nearby star.\n\nFellaonamission asks, Why is water essential\n\nfor life on other planets?\n\nEverywhere on Earth where there's life, there's water.\n\nAnd almost everywhere on Earth where there's water,\n\nthere's life.\n\nWater is sort of the universal solvent\n\nthat allows life to happen.\n\nBasically, we are organic molecules dissolved in water,\n\ndancing together and doing complex things,\n\nand reproducing themselves.\n\nAs far as we can tell, that's what life is.\n\nYou clearly need a liquid medium\n\nbecause the molecules have\n\nto come together in this complex 3D dance\n\nthat if they're just frozen in a solid\n\nor loose in a gas, they won't do it.\n\nSo, as far as we can tell, you need a liquid for life.\n\nWater is a common liquid in the Universe\n\nand has those properties of interacting with organics\n\nthat we have not been able to mimic\n\nwith any other chemical in a lab.\n\nSo we don't know for sure\n\nthat the Universe couldn't have done it in some other way.\n\nMaybe we'll be surprised and find life in ammonia\n\nor methane, or some other liquid.\n\nBut as far as we can tell, water is the key\n\nto life in the Universe.\n\nSo, Gabe3115 asks,\n\nWhat do we think about assembly theory?\n\nSo, assembly theory attempts to describe the nature of life.\n\nWhat is the difference between living matter\n\nand non-living matter?\n\nHow could we recognize that?\n\nWell, most of the Universe is made\n\nof very simple molecules like this carbon dioxide.\n\nThat's not a very complex molecule.\n\nBut if you look at the molecules of life like amino acids,\n\nyou can see carbon, carbon, carbon,\n\ncarbon bonded together in complex ways with other hydrogens.\n\nAnd they get much more complex than this,\n\nand they can be hundreds or thousands\n\nor tens of thousands of atoms bonded together.\n\nBut you can see\n\nthat this is very different from these simple molecules.\n\nAnd what assembly theory does is characterize the complexity\n\nof molecules in a way\n\nthat tells us when something is complex enough\n\nso that it must have been made by life.\n\nOneskipydino asks,\n\nCan someone give me a short explanation\n\nof the Drake equation, and the probability\n\nof us being alone?\n\nI happen to have a copy right here.\n\nIt's a way of thinking through the probability\n\nof extraterrestrial life that was devised\n\nby Astronomer Frank Drake in the early 1960s.\n\nFrank Drake was the first one\n\nto actually point a radio telescope elsewhere from Earth,\n\nand start to listen to see if he can find alien signals.\n\nAnd to help think through the probability\n\nof finding those signals,\n\nhe came up with this really pretty simple equation.\n\nN is the number of communicating civilizations out there.\n\nR, that's just the rate of star formation in the galaxy.\n\nF-sub-P, the probability of planet formation\n\naround those stars.\n\nN-sub-e, the number of habitable planets per star.\n\nF-sub-l, the fraction of planets\n\nthat have an origin of life.\n\nF-sub-i is getting into more speculative territory.\n\nThat's the fraction of planets with life\n\nwhere intelligent life evolves.\n\nAnd of course, we only have one example, it's Earth.\n\nAnd then f-sub-c is even more speculative.\n\nThat's the fraction of planets with intelligent life\n\nthat have communicating civilizations that are sending\n\nor possibly receiving messages.\n\nFinally, multiplied by L or the average longevity\n\nof communicating civilizations.\n\nIf communicating civilizations don't last long,\n\nperhaps because they do themselves in through nuclear war\n\nor climate change or some other process,\n\nthen the numbers suggest\n\nthat civilizations that we could communicate with are\n\nprobably very rare and might be hard to find out there.\n\nOn the other hand, if L is long,\n\nbecause some civilizations can last a very long time,\n\nthey solve their problems, they learn how\n\nto live sustainably on a planet, then the math works out\n\nthat there should be lots of civilizations out there\n\nthat we can find.\n\nSo the numbers vary widely depending\n\non how you estimate some of these unknown factors.\n\nBut some of these factors we do now know pretty well.\n\nWe know the star formation rate in the galaxy.\n\nAnd importantly, we've recently discovered\n\nthat planets are very, very common.\n\nThat tells us that as long as the origin\n\nof life is not super, super rare, there must be lots\n\nand lots of planets out there with life.\n\nChadfromthefuture asked, Why doesn't\n\nthe Europa Clipper deploy something into the moon\n\nto check for life?\n\nAt one point, there was the idea\n\nof including a lander on Europa Clipper.\n\nBut it was decided that the real point\n\nof this mission is just to characterize Europa\n\nand decide if it is habitable.\n\nWe'll then know which locations on the surface are\n\nthe right locations to send a lander.\n\nWhereas now, we would sort of be guessing it.\n\nAlso, it costs a lot to send a mission to Europa,\n\nand the more complex you make the mission with an orbiter\n\nand a lander and other pieces, the price goes up,\n\nand then you're less likely to have the mission at all.\n\nSo, if Clipper does confirm, as we suspect,\n\nthat Europa is a habitable world, you can be sure\n\nthat in the future, we will be sending landers\n\nto directly search for life there.\n\nBrowner555 asks, What is Area 51 actually used for?\n\nWell, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.\n\nNo. [laughs] Just kidding.\n\nArea 51 is a place\n\nwhere experimental military aircraft are tested.\n\nThis is common knowledge, and that's all I know,\n\nand I've seen no evidence that it's anything else.\n\nRinsetheplates_first asks, What is the Fermi Paradox?\n\nSo the Fermi paradox is named\n\nafter the great Italian American physicist Enrico Fermi,\n\nwho famously asked, Where is everybody?\n\nWith all the possible life forms\n\nand civilizations in the galaxy,\n\nand with a galaxy that is billions of years old,\n\nwhy aren't there obvious signs of extraterrestrial life?\n\nThat's really what we mean by the Fermi Paradox.\n\nIn my view, it's not really a paradox\n\n'cause we haven't really looked yet, very thoroughly.\n\nWith SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,\n\nJill Tarter, who's one\n\nof our great SETI scientists, has likened it to,\n\nif the Universe is an ocean,\n\nwe've basically searched a teacup full of water.\n\nEven though we've been searching with radio telescopes\n\nfor 60 years now,\n\nif you look at the number of stars we've looked at carefully\n\nand the frequencies we've analyzed compared to the amount\n\nof search space there is,\n\nthat it's just a teacup in the ocean.\n\nSo we could have easily missed it.\n\nInfinityScientist asks, What kind\n\nof techno signature could be detected\n\nfrom a very faraway galaxy?\n\nThat's an interesting one.\n\nIf you were an alien looking at Earth, you might notice\n\nthat our atmosphere has changed.\n\nYou might notice lights from our civilization, those kinds\n\nof things we call techno signatures.\n\nJust any observation that can betray the existence\n\nof some kind of technological activity or civilization.\n\nThe only kind of techno signature I can think\n\nof from a very far away galaxy would be some kind\n\nof incredibly advanced civilization\n\nthat is actually manipulating the geometry\n\nof that galaxy in some way.\n\nCreating things like Dyson spheres,\n\nthese large structures in a solar system that are meant\n\nto gather all the solar energy from that star\n\nand power their technology.\n\nAnd that would put out an unusual infrared signature.\n\nSo, we actually have the ability to look\n\nfor things like that.\n\nWhen we're talking about the possible abilities\n\nof very advanced technologies,\n\nyou almost have to get very out there.\n\nLike Arthur C Clarke said,\n\nAny sufficiently advanced technology may be\n\nindistinguishable from magic.\n\nAnd the fact is, if you look at how fast technology changes,\n\nit's very hard to say it would be impossible\n\nfor some civilization\n\nto create these astroengineering works\n\nthat would be visible from distant galaxies.\n\nUlteriorkid324 asks, What is SETI?\n\nIs it just people listening to alien radio stations?\n\nSo, SETI stands for\n\nthe Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,\n\nand it's been mostly radio searches.\n\nBut more recently, now we have what we call optical SETI,\n\nwhere the idea is that they may not be sending radio pulses,\n\nthey may be sending laser pulses.\n\nSo with optical SETI, we look in optical visible wavelengths\n\nfor laser pulses from other stars.\n\nWe also shouldn't confuse SETI with METI,\n\nwhich is Messages to Extraterrestrial Intelligence,\n\nwhich is more controversial.\n\nSome people are opposed to METI for a couple of reasons.\n\nOne is they think it's arrogant to assume\n\nthat any one person or program\n\nor institution could speak for all of Earth.\n\nUser0301 asks,\n\nNASA announced it has detected a gas\n\non a planet 120 light-years away\n\nthat might indicate life, how?\n\nSo, one of the things we do is we look for\n\nwhat we call bio signature gases in their atmospheres.\n\nA report was published\n\nthat a chemical called dimethyl sulfide had been detected\n\nin the atmosphere of an exoplanet called K2-18B\n\nthat might have a habitable watery environment,\n\nwhich would be a very exciting thing to find.\n\nDimethyl sulfide is a gas that, on Earth,\n\nis associated with life largely,\n\nalthough there are other ways to make it.\n\nSo they're not sure that dimethyl sulfide has\n\nreally been found on this exoplanet.\n\nSo, as far as how we detect gases in a distant atmosphere\n\nof an exoplanet, we use spectroscopy.\n\nBasically, we observe the amount of light at a range\n\nof wavelengths across the visible, the infrared,\n\nthe ultraviolet spectrum on an exoplanet.\n\nAnd we've learned\n\nthat patterns in those spectra reveal\n\nthe existence of different gases.\n\nSo, for instance, this is a spectrum\n\nfrom an exoplanet called WASP-96 b.\n\nYou can see some of these peaks and valleys.\n\nThis is a peak that indicates water, which is pretty amazing\n\nbecause water is one of the key gases\n\nfor thinking about life in the Universe.\n\nHere's a question from the AskHistorians Subreddit.\n\nAre there any compelling cases\n\nof UFO/UAP sightings in history?\n\nFrom an astrobiology perspective,\n\nthe short answer is no.\n\nThere are a lot of phenomena in our atmosphere\n\nthat have not been characterized yet.\n\nThere have been things discovered recently,\n\nstrange high altitude, lightning formations called sprites\n\nthat were reported and dismissed,\n\nand then they turn out to be real.\n\nI would not doubt\n\nthat there are strange things in our atmosphere\n\nthat have not yet been identified,\n\nwhether they are any indication of alien technology,\n\nto me, that's a kind of last resort explanation.\n\nEven if they are technology,\n\nI would probably say it's much more likely\n\nthat they are human technology that some humans know about\n\nand other humans don't.\n\nWhy we have to resort to aliens to explain this?\n\nTo me, if anything that seems kind of a lack of imagination\n\nor really a big leap that I wouldn't be prepared\n\nto make without some more specific evidence for that.\n\n@Redacted Media asks, What if we could see\n\nand interact with the shadow biome?\n\nWhat if there's some other form of life on Earth\n\nthat we're not even fully aware of?\n\nWhat if there's another form\n\nof life, perhaps hiding underground\n\nor in some place that we think is very uninhabitable\n\nbecause our kind of life couldn't exist there?\n\nYou know, highly acidic places\n\nor places that are so extreme\n\nthat we think life couldn't exist.\n\nThat, in fact, does exist on Earth.\n\nAnd that's the notion of a shadow biosphere.\n\nAnd by its very nature,\n\nthe concept implies something we haven't\n\nreally encountered or thought of yet.\n\nIt's a kind of question that's worth our keeping in mind\n\nas astrobiologists, so that we don't assume\n\nthat we know everything about life,\n\nwhen in fact, we're just beginning\n\nto understand the possibilities for life in the Universe.\n\nWell, here's another good question.\n\nWas there ever life on Mars?\n\nWhat I can tell you is the more we've studied Mars,\n\nthe more we've learned about its earliest environment.\n\nIt seems to be similar to the early environment\n\nof Earth at the time when the origin\n\nof life is believed to have happened.\n\nThere are dried-up river valleys, there are dried-up lakes\n\nwith waterborne sediments, there are flood valleys,\n\nall kinds of signs that Mars, when it was young, was a wet\n\nand warmer place with a more Clement climate, with lakes,\n\nwith flowing water, and most likely with organic molecules.\n\nSo, Mars, we believe, had the conditions\n\nfor an origin of life.\n\nHave we found evidence for early life on Mars yet?\n\nNo, but we're searching for it.\n\nAnd that's one of the reasons we have these Mars rovers,\n\nand hopefully, someday, bringing samples back,\n\nso that we can examine those rocks\n\nin our laboratories on Earth,\n\nand identify, for sure, whether there was life on Mars.\n\nPietin11 asks,\n\nWould a Venus sample return mission be possible?\n\nIt wouldn't be that easy\n\nbecause Venus has a very thick atmosphere.\n\nYou can't see the surface\n\nbecause it's surrounded by these thick clouds\n\nof sulfuric acids, so battery acid.\n\nSo it's not an easy place to explore or to get to.\n\nUltimately, we would really like to do so.\n\nHaving samples on Earth is so valuable\n\nbecause instead of having to send your little instruments\n\nup there, and do the experiments\n\nand radio home the results,\n\nyou can have a whole Earth laboratory.\n\nYou can have all the time that you want,\n\nand using all the resources of our laboratory.\n\nPokoirl asks, Is a habitable planet\n\nwith no tectonic activity plausible?\n\nWe're still trying to understand the nature\n\nof habitability, but one thing\n\nthat's certainly true about Earth,\n\nthe one habitable planet we know is that possibility\n\nfor life here is facilitated by plate tectonics,\n\nby the motion of the Earth's surface, driven by the motion\n\nof the interior, which moves the surface around,\n\nand not only makes mountains and Earthquakes, and all that,\n\nbut brings nutrients continually to the surface,\n\nand sort of renews the surface of the Earth.\n\nKeeps it fertile.\n\nWe definitely think tectonic activity is related\n\nto habitability.\n\nAnd you would imagine for a planet to be habitable,\n\nthere needs to be some kind of ongoing geological activity.\n\nIs it absolutely required?\n\nWe don't know.\n\nFor instance, there are these ocean worlds like Europa\n\nand other places where habitability could just be\n\non the inside,\n\nand maybe you would not have tectonic activity\n\nin the outside if there were other energy sources\n\nand way of recycling nutrients.\n\nCoochieman127 asked,\n\nDo you think we detect intelligent life\n\nwithin the next 100 years?\n\nSo, with the James Webb Space Telescope, we're just getting\n\nto the point where we can identify gases\n\nin exoplanet atmospheres, and with future space telescopes,\n\nthen we will have the ability to really say\n\nwhat's in that atmosphere\n\nof this exoplanet and that exoplanet.\n\nAnd once we can do that, then we at least have a chance\n\nof funding some kind of techno signature.\n\nSimilarly, our radio searches are getting\n\nmuch more sophisticated.\n\nSo, the completeness with which we're examining the rest\n\nof the Universe is increasing rapidly, which makes me think,\n\nagain, if the aliens are there waiting to be found,\n\nthat within the next 100 years,\n\nwe have a pretty decent chance of finding them.\n\nSo those are all the questions for today.\n\nAnd thanks for watching Alien Support.\n\n[lively music]", "summary": "", "keywords":

Okay.\n\nYeah, and so as the technology gets better,\n\nand it gets trained on more of my thoughts,\n\nit's only going to improve.\n\nI think all of us are in a time and place\n\nwhere we will be immortal to some degree.\n\nNow, whether it's in this body,\n\nwhether it's in some kind of computational arrangement,\n\nwhether it's both, or a combination of both,\n\nI think we've reached that point as a civilization.\n\nAnd the reason I ask that, I mean maybe it's obvious,\n\nbut I'm trying to sort of understand\n\nfrom what premise you are beginning, right?\n\nBecause you talk a lot about living a healthier life,\n\nextending the human lifespan.\n\nWhat I was curious about is sort of how far you see\n\nthat possibly going,\n\nand sort of whether you accept the notion for yourself\n\nthat, at some point, you, Bryan,\n\nyour biological material, right,\n\neverything that makes you you will be buried,\n\nwill be cremated, there will be a will,\n\nthere will be an estate plan, right?\n\nThat all of those things\n\nthat go into the way we plan for death,\n\nlike, are those things that you contemplate\n\nand that you plan for or not?\n\nDo you have a will?\n\nI do.\n\nYeah. Good.\n\nI do.\n\nI have a will,\n\nand I've made all the practical decisions on,\n\nif I am in a comatose state, what are my instructions?\n\nSo I have gone through all those preparations.\n\nThe future is always present.\n\nIt's just a question if you can see it or not.\n\nAnd I think this moment is probably the biggest test\n\nof trying to piece together what is really happening\n\nwith the speed at which AI is improving\n\nand what does that mean\n\nfor how it's going to change everything we understand\n\nabout reality.\n\nAnd many people are poking at this,\n\nlike, trying to make their predictions\n\nand organize the world to the best they can.\n\nAnd I'm basically saying\n\nthat we are headed towards this event horizon\n\nwhere AI is now improving at a certain speed.\n\nIn a few years time, we probably can't see past that point.\n\nWe don't know what happens.\n\nAnd as technology gets better and better,\n\nthe most prized asset is going to be existence.\n\nThat immortality, as we thought about it before,\n\nthrough accomplishment or through offspring\n\nor any other, or the afterlife,\n\nwill be devalued relative to existing.\n\nAnd that's my fundamental bet on the future,\n\nis that's where we're headed.\n\n[camera shutter clicks]\n\nLet me ask you this,\n\nif there was a world where, let's say, in five years,\n\nyou could upload Bryan...\n\nYeah.\n\nInto an AI, right,\n\nan AI Bryan is, yeah, pretty much as good as Bryan Bryan.\n\nDoes Bryan Bryan eat the cheeseburger?\n\nYeah. You know what I mean?\n\nLike, does some of this, does sort of this, you know,\n\nfrom everything I can tell,\n\nit is every waking minute of your life,\n\nand it is every sleeping minute of your life\n\nsort of committed to this one singular goal, right?\n\nThat is your entire existence.\n\nYeah.\n\nHave you contemplated whether or not that would change?\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, okay, so let's think about your question\n\nin a different way.\n\nI could say about people today\n\nthat most people spend every waking moment pursuing wealth.\n\nThe time they're not spending pursuing wealth,\n\nthey're pursuing some sort of status or prestige,\n\nyou know, socially signaling to their community,\n\ntheir tribe of some power,\n\nor something to that effect.\n\nNow, I could certainly say that\n\nand say that's a malaise that has everybody locked in\n\nto a singular game that is consuming\n\nall of their resources and all their attention.\n\nAnd what I'm saying is I'm devoting every second\n\nof my existence to existence.\n\nWhen you die, inevitably, that's when how it has been,\n\nit makes sense to pursue power and status.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nWhen you give birth to superintelligence\n\nand now you can start extending lifespans\n\nto some unknown horizon, 200 years, a thousand years,\n\n10,000 years, we don't know, millions of years,\n\nwe don't know.\n\nWhen that happens, the entire game of humanity shifts\n\nfrom that singular focus\n\non wealth accumulation and status and prestige to existence.\n\nNow embedded in existence,\n\nwe may still play games\n\nof power, prestige, status, et cetera,\n\nbut it'll be conditioned of that existence itself\n\nis the highest virtue.\n\nThat's the shift that's starting to happen right now.\n\nSo let me pivot over then to the conversation\n\nabout your existence.\n\nSo, you know, you've talked at length,\n\nyou talked a great deal.\n\nYou are very much out there in the public eye\n\ntalking about a day in the life of Bryan.\n\nYeah.\n\nWalk us through a day in the life right now.\n\nI know that the protocol changes,\n\nthat you're adapting it, modifying it.\n\nWhat does it look like today?\n\nTake us through a typical day\n\nfor you. Yeah.\n\nIt may be helpful to have the backdrop\n\nthat what I do is I'm saying\n\nthat existence is the highest virtue.\n\nAnd if you accept that premise, then I say on a given day,\n\nI want to identify every single thing\n\nthat could kill me or make me die.\n\nAnd then I want to identify every single thing\n\nthat could help me make me live.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd so let's just say I live in California\n\nand the life expectancy is around 79 years.\n\nSo if I behave like a typical human,\n\nI probably have a life expectancy to 79 years of age.\n\nNow, if I identify things\n\nthat could potentially shorten that,\n\nlike smoking, drinking, breathing bad air,\n\ndrinking toxic water, you know, not getting exercise,\n\net cetera, then if I think of good things\n\nthat could extend my life even further\n\nto, you know, currently the cap is, like, 120,\n\nI can say, well, I'm gonna eat healthy foods and exercise.\n\nAnd so my daily protocol\n\nis basically trying to identify at a molecular level\n\nevery single thing that either extends or shortens life, so.\n\nI mean, I'm laughing because your daily protocol,\n\nI will be honest, it's much more elaborate\n\nthan eating well and exercising.\n\nIt was not just eating well and exercising,\n\nlike, you'd have a pretty chill time.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou're not necessarily having, like, the chillest time.\n\n[Bryan] Yeah.\n\nTell us a little bit\n\nabout that. Okay, cool.\n\nSo, my everyday begins the night before.\n\n[Katie] Okay.\n\nSo I have built my entire existence around sleep.\n\nI mean, I like that. You have to sleep.\n\nYeah. How well do you sleep?\n\nWell, we're gonna get to that.\n\nCan you tell me how many hours a night you sleep?\n\nEight hours and 34 minutes is my 12-month average.\n\nMy sleep profile is that of a early 20 something.\n\nI've worked very hard at this.\n\nSo it's eight hours and 34 minutes.\n\nI get over four hours of restorative sleep.\n\nThat's deep sleep and REM, where the body cleans itself\n\nand repairs and rebuilds.\n\nI'm up less than one time per night on average.\n\nI go to bed, within two to three minutes,\n\nI have my head hitting the pillow,\n\nand I have 94% sleep efficiency.\n\nSo once I lay down\n\nand my stress score during the night,\n\nlike, typically, most people's sleep signal\n\nis like a rocky chart of a stock market, you know,\n\nand mine is just flat, like my consciousness is at peace.\n\nAnd so those are the stats you wanna see\n\nfor a perfect night's sleep.\n\nBut to do that, you can't just show up\n\nand just say, I'm gonna put my head on the pillow\n\nand fall asleep.\n\nYou kind of have to build\n\nyour whole life system around that.\n\nSo my day begins the night before when I go to sleep,\n\nand then I'll wake up around 4:30 or 5:00.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd then I'll do, for the next four hours,\n\nI will have a series of measurements and therapies.\n\nI get outta bed, I try to, within one minute of waking.\n\nWithin one minute?\n\nYeah, I try to avoid the 10 more minutes\n\nor pull the phone up and start scrolling.\n\nI get up, I will get light in my eyes\n\nwithin a few minutes of waking.\n\nSo I wake up before the sun,\n\nso it's 10,000 lux light in my eye for a few minutes.\n\nI'll take my inner ear temperature.\n\nI measure my temperature every single day.\n\nOne thing we've noticed is,\n\nas I've done this for the past four years,\n\nmy body temperature has dropped\n\nalmost four degrees Fahrenheit, a massive drop.\n\nSo now it's around 94 degrees Fahrenheit each morning.\n\nThat's down from 98.7.\n\nSo there's good evidence that species\n\nwith a lower basal temperature live longer.\n\nI will then put a serum on my hair or my scalp,\n\nrub my scalp with a silicone scrubber for hair growth.\n\nI'll take a quick shower and then I'll come downstairs.\n\nI have a morning drink.\n\nI will eat something, I'll work out for an hour.\n\nI'll do red light therapy.\n\nI'll then do a hyperbaric oxygen therapy, then some sauna,\n\nthen I'll rinse off and then I'm ready for work.\n\nOkay. So that is quite a regimen.\n\nAnd you stop eating at?\n\nAround noon.\n\nAround noon.\n\nYeah, and then, like, also in the morning,\n\nI'll typically do, like, a few tests.\n\nLike today, I did three tests.\n\nThere's so much to this protocol,\n\nthere's sort of so much data that you've accumulated.\n\nReally quickly, like, rapid fire,\n\nnot to put you on the spot, but I am,\n\nask me a couple really quick questions about myself.\n\n[Bryan] Yeah. And then tell me\n\nhow am I doing in the Bryan Johnson universe.\n\n[Bryan] Great. Go.\n\nWhat is your resting heart rate?\n\n48 beats per minute.\n\n[Bryan] That's fantastic. Thank you.\n\nWhat is your most recent inflammation,\n\nyour body inflammation blood test result, your hs-CRP?\n\nBryan, I have no idea.\n\nWhat is your blood glucose level?\n\nA good one.\n\nOkay. Okay, good.\n\nHow many continuous pushups can you do?\n\nProbably, like, 10. Okay.\n\nIf you stood on one foot and closed your eye,\n\nhow long could you stay standing?\n\nA minute.\n\nYeah. A minute?\n\n[Katie] Yes. A minute.\n\nThat's very good.\n\nOh, yeah.\n\n[Bryan] Okay. Good. Try me.\n\n[Bryan] Okay. Not right now.\n\n[Bryan laughs]\n\nYeah. What is the length of your telomeres?\n\nI don't know.\n\nOkay. What are your omega levels?\n\n[Bryan] I don't know. Okay.\n\nThese are very involved questions.\n\nWhat is your speed of aging?\n\nWell, according to the skin test I took earlier, Bryan,\n\nit was 1.9.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nSo tell me, okay, so I didn't learn very much.\n\nI think what I learned is that there's a lot more to this\n\nthan do you drink, do you smoke, do you exercise,\n\ndo you sleep enough?\n\nThat's what I thought you were gonna ask me.\n\nI do not know the length of my telomeres.\n\n[Bryan] Yeah. But apparently,\n\nthat's something someone can find out.\n\nYeah, so the reason I ask you those questions\n\nis because I can pose a question, like, How's your sleep?\n\n[Katie] Yeah.\n\nAnd you can give me a generic answer like,\n\nI sleep great or I feel great.\n\nBut if you look at the actual data of your telomere length,\n\nit tells me the story of your overall health.\n\nThe same with your blood glucose levels.\n\nThe same with your speed of aging.\n\nThese are readouts of your biology that just say,\n\nThis is me in raw form.\n\nThere's no storytelling, there's no subjective assessment.\n\nIt's just the data.\n\n[camera shutter clicks]\n\nYou were in a Netflix documentary earlier this year.\n\nYou talked a lot sort of about your history\n\nin that documentary, right?\n\nYou were a successful entrepreneur.\n\nYou felt like you weren't living your healthiest life.\n\nYou parted ways with Mormonism.\n\nYou were Mormon for a very, very long time.\n\nYou got divorced, right?\n\nYou went through all of these seismic life changes.\n\nAnd a lot of people make major changes\n\nto their lives, right?\n\nThey hit a wall with stress or in a marriage\n\nor with their religion, right?\n\nExceedingly few people.\n\nVery, very, very, very, very few people\n\ngo as far as you have.\n\nWhat is it that pushed you past the point\n\nthat the vast majority of people would go?\n\nI'm really motivated by having read\n\nvarious biographies of history\n\nand people throughout time and place,\n\nin their moment, they were able to identify\n\nthe most far ranging ambition identifiable.\n\nYou couldn't have sequenced the genome in the year 1800.\n\nThe technology wasn't present.\n\nYou could have had that ambition in the early 90s.\n\nAnd that they did, someone did.\n\nAnd they actually sequenced the genome.\n\nAnd so in any given time point,\n\na new emergent possibility is present.\n\nThen there's two questions that arise.\n\nOne is, what is it?\n\nAnd two is, will somebody do it?\n\nAnd in the year 2021 was the first time in human history\n\nwhere a person could say,\n\nWe are the first generation who won't die\n\nand not be ridiculed.\n\nIt just became possible.\n\nAnd I saw that and I thought this is a moment,\n\nlike, when it comes together where you see it\n\nand you can do something about it.\n\nAnd so I wanted to try to capture what this moment is.\n\nHmm.\n\nNow, if you talk to people who know me,\n\nif you asked my husband, right, poor guy,\n\nthey would say that I'm a very controlled person, right?\n\nLike, I wake up at the same time every day.\n\nI do the same exercise.\n\nI tend to eat a lot of very similar foods.\n\nLike, there's a lot of routine and structure to my life.\n\nI will say, when I read about you,\n\nwhen I watch, you know, videos about you,\n\nwhen I hear about the way you live,\n\nI, as a very controlled person,\n\nam astounded at how controlled your life is.\n\nHave you always been that way?\n\nWell, like, when you think back 20 years ago, 30 years ago,\n\nsix years ago, was control always something\n\nthat was a defining characteristic?\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nI suppose it's the difference\n\nbetween being called a germophobe and being germ-aware\n\nand how people label your methodical building\n\nof life systems as control.\n\nAnd I would reframe it and say,\n\nyou're actually a really smart engineer.\n\nThat you realize that the metabolic cost\n\nof you having to make these decisions every single day\n\nspur of the moment is so expensive to you\n\nthat you are wise and say, You know what?\n\nIt's not worth it.\n\nI'm just going to systematize this\n\nso that my brain can then be allocated\n\ntowards other higher level thinking.\n\nSo I would applaud your systems\n\nand say like, you actually are very clever\n\nin the way you've structured your life.\n\nAnd so I kind of feel the same way\n\nthat why would I fight these daily miscellaneous,\n\nultimately irrelevant decisions\n\non a moment-to-moment basis when they can just be automated?\n\nAnd I'd rather spend my scarce brain capacity\n\nthinking of higher level things\n\nabout the future of the human race, for example,\n\nthan I would, like, what am I gonna have for breakfast?\n\nAnd so I think historically,\n\nI've very much thought like an engineer my entire life.\n\nYou take a given system, you dissect its parts,\n\nyou reassemble it into some kind of constructive\n\nand positive manner.\n\nBut I'd say, like, what I do now\n\nis definitely beyond what I did before.\n\nBut what I'm trying to demonstrate is Bryan Johnson in 2025\n\nis a normal dude in 2030.\n\nIt's just like our-\n\nIn five years?\n\nIn five years, that the apparatus around us\n\nthat things will just be automated,\n\nhealth will be so much more automated than we are now.\n\nThat the weirdness of who I am\n\nor what I am will be forgotten.\n\nPeople will remember in that context,\n\nbut when they look at me, they'll just be like,\n\nOh, yeah, like, he just was ahead of the time.\n\n[camera shutter clicks]\n\nI was getting ready for this interview.\n\nI was reading, sort of reading up on you.\n\nAnd in 2023, I was leading the newsroom at VICE.\n\nAnd we actually published a story on you.\n\nAnd you talked in that story about your body image\n\nfrom decades ago.\n\nYou talked about how hard it was at that time\n\nto control yourself around food at night, right?\n\nYou talked about how you now often go to bed hungry,\n\nthat you have learned to find joy in that.\n\nAnd in reading that and just in very good faith,\n\nI'm being very transparent with you here,\n\nif I stripped your name out of that,\n\nand I just looked at a bulleted list of those comments,\n\nyou know, that sounds a lot like me 20 years ago\n\nwith a very serious eating disorder.\n\nI mean, there was a period in my life where I was very sick,\n\nand I was very controlled\n\nand everything that went into my mouth, right?\n\nAnd it wasn't about the number on the scale,\n\nit wasn't about how I looked.\n\nIt was about being able to systematize\n\nand control my environment.\n\nAnd, you know, I am not a doctor, I'm not a psychiatrist.\n\nI think if you were to ask some doctors and psychiatrists,\n\nand I'm sure this criticism has been leveled before,\n\nthese comments have been made before,\n\nthey would say, Well, that sounds like disordered behavior.\n\nThat sounds like an eating disorder.\n\nYeah.\n\nDoes that resonate with you?\n\nI mean, how do you respond to that?\n\nAnd I think particularly,\n\nwhen we're talking not just about you,\n\nbut about you as a public figure\n\nadvocating for a certain approach to health,\n\ndo you have concerns about sort of\n\nwhat you are advocating for and sort of what you are doing\n\nand how that might be adopted\n\nby sort of the population at large?\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nMost people I know in America have an eating disorder.\n\nI rarely meet somebody\n\nwho doesn't find themselves late in the evening powerless\n\nto stop themselves from eating the ice cream or the cookies\n\nor the chips or, you know,\n\nwhatever else they find in the pantry.\n\nThat is probably the most universal experience\n\nshared among Americans in this moment.\n\nAnd it probably has to do with a combination of,\n\nit's culturally acceptable.\n\nOur foods were scientifically,\n\nmethodically built to be addictive.\n\nYou just pull up an app\n\nand, like, delivers to your house real time\n\nwhatever you want.\n\nSo I would say it's really more\n\nof a widespread societal problem\n\nthat we have an addiction problem with food, our phones,\n\nand, you know, our entertainment, our scrolling,\n\nit's everywhere.\n\nAnd so certainly,\n\nI don't know if my addiction is more excessive\n\nthan other people's addictions,\n\nor if it just weighted more towards food versus the phone.\n\nBut I'd say I'm probably pretty average\n\non a population level addiction scale.\n\nHmm, and so you have sort of taken that,\n\nI guess, what used to manifest in one way,\n\nwhich is sort of, like, an inability\n\nto control what you were eating when you were eating it.\n\nAnd you have adopted a new way of approaching it,\n\nwhich is saying, I eat these things at these times,\n\nand I sort of eliminate the variables,\n\nI take the choice out of it,\n\nand that is how I am going to manage\n\nthis part of my health.\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nAnd I guess more broadly,\n\nit's kind of a cultural commentary\n\nwhere I'm saying the most powerful forces in all of society,\n\ncorporations, are pointing their power\n\nat getting you to be addicted to their thing.\n\nWhether it's scrolling their app,\n\nwhether it's eating their food,\n\nwhether it's watching their show,\n\nall their science, all their technology,\n\nall their intelligence is pointed at you\n\nand trying to get you to be addicted.\n\nAnd what I was saying is, when you are addicted to anything,\n\nit reduces your freedom and your agency,\n\nthey ultimately have you in a bind.\n\nI don't want to be addicted to anything.\n\nI wanna have agency and freedom over my existence\n\nas much as possible.\n\nAnd so that's what I'm trying to build.\n\nAnd so I realize that people on the outside looking in,\n\nthey do take that approach\n\nand say, He's working through his childhood trauma,\n\nhe's working through a food addiction.\n\nI'm open to all those explanations.\n\nLike, I would be the first person to be self-deprecating\n\nand be like, This guy's got issues, unquestionably.\n\nAlso, in my interactions with others,\n\nit is a very common phenomena\n\nthat humans struggle in modern society.\n\nAnd I'm trying to offer an antidote\n\nthat I didn't have anybody,\n\nnot a single person in my life advocating for me\n\nthat I take care of my health.\n\nNobody.\n\nIt was work harder.\n\nLike, I'm so proud of you for achieving this.\n\nLike, didn't matter if I was ragged or depressed\n\nor overweight, like, the direction went elsewhere\n\nexcept for, Bryan, can I be a positive influence\n\nin your life and encourage you to go to bed on time\n\nand get some exercise?\n\nSo I'm really trying to play that role in society\n\nwhere I'm saying, Look, this is a mess.\n\nWe are all a mess.\n\nAnd can we be honest about the situation?\n\nEven those who are accusing me of being addicted\n\nand having a food eating disorder\n\nor whatever the problem,\n\nthey themselves are equally shackled with addictions.\n\nYou're addicted to longevity.\n\nYeah.\n\nThere's probably no way of actually getting over addiction\n\nother than controlling where your addiction is pointed.\n\nI would agree with that.\n\n[camera shutter clicks]\n\nI wanna ask you about your fame.\n\nYou were sort of just talking about population-wide health,\n\nand I think that one of the observations\n\nthat I have made as a journalist in the last several months,\n\nsince President Trump was elected\n\nand inaugurated in late January,\n\nis that to me with notoriety, with fame\n\ncomes a degree of responsibility, right?\n\nResponsibility for what you say, how you say it,\n\nwhen you speak up, when you choose not to.\n\nI want to ask you about MAHA.\n\nI wanna ask you about RFK Jr.\n\nWhen President Trump won the election,\n\nyou congratulated him on social media\n\nas did so many very high-profile business leaders.\n\nYou were photographed with RFK Jr.,\n\nMAHA as sort of the tagline in the photo.\n\nI'm really curious for your assessment\n\nat this point in time of RFK Jr.\n\nand the Trump administration vis-a-vis American health.\n\nIf I had to guess,\n\nand I'll let you answer the question in a minute,\n\nyou know, I would suspect that there's a lot there\n\nthat someone in your position would like, right?\n\nThe idea of, you know, stripping additives outta food.\n\nYou know, we have also seen massive cuts\n\nat federal health agencies.\n\nWe have seen already, you know, grants\n\nwith regards to cutting-edge research,\n\nmRNA vaccines being a very early target.\n\nWe've seen a lot of sort of the very promising\n\nsort of bleeding-edge medical research\n\nthat you have been able to adopt in your own life.\n\nYou know, really on the chopping block\n\nin this administration,\n\nI would really appreciate your assessment\n\nof the Trump administration and RFK Jr.\n\nas it pertains to public health,\n\nwhich is, you know, in many ways,\n\nthe sort of premise of your entire operation here, right?\n\nWhich is really sort of educating the public\n\nabout how to live a healthier life.\n\nYeah.\n\nHow do you rate the administration so far?\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean RFK is certainly not a status quo person.\n\nI think you can say that,\n\nyeah. Yeah.\n\nAnd I think I would say\n\nthat the status quo in the U.S. is not working.\n\nIf you look at the data around the health of our citizenry,\n\nit's embarrassingly bad.\n\nWe spend 1.8 times our peer countries in healthcare,\n\n$13,000 per person versus, like, 6,000 or so\n\nthe other developed countries.\n\nSo we spend more and we get less.\n\nAnd so whether RFK is the solution or not,\n\nwhat we're doing is not working.\n\nI'm open to change,\n\nand I'm open to a variety of possibilities.\n\nIt's not to say that everything he's doing is correct,\n\nbut I do support the idea\n\nthat we definitely need to change,\n\nbecause what we're doing now is not working.\n\nDo you worry about medical research\n\nbeing delayed, right, by years or decades,\n\nif it is curtailed right now?\n\nYeah.\n\nIn these kinds of circumstances,\n\nI'm not apprehensive of change.\n\nScience always finds a way forward,\n\nand progress always finds a way forward.\n\nAnd so oftentimes, when one path is discontinued,\n\neverybody thinks it's an end of something,\n\nbut actually that change produces a new path\n\nthat people didn't anticipate.\n\nSo, no, I support the creative destruction.\n\nI think it could have some positive outcomes.\n\nClearly, there could be some drawbacks,\n\nlike, when you break things like this, it goes both ways.\n\nIt's not, like, a clean win or loss.\n\nBut I'm generally in favor of new ideas or new approach.\n\nBecause I mean, I think, what would be cool\n\nis if we as a country said\n\nwe want to be number one in the entire world\n\nfor life expectancy, that is a very clear goal.\n\nAnd then once you back into it\n\nand you look at all the practical things\n\nthat determine that,\n\nbut that to me would be like a something\n\nwe all can say we agree,\n\nlike living long, healthy lives\n\nand not, you know, long health spans\n\nwould be an admirable goal for entire country.\n\nSo I would like more unification on this\n\nthat we actually have a big goal to work towards,\n\nversus now it's, like, trying to find the evil doers\n\nand knocking them out, which is fine,\n\nbut also we don't really have a positive goal.\n\nWho are the evil doers that we're knocking out?\n\nI mean, for example, like, you see the red dye.\n\nA lot of the ingredients we have in this country\n\nare not used because they promote health.\n\nThey're used because they create addiction,\n\nor they're low cost.\n\nAnd so I think there's an acceptance of selling death.\n\nAnd we just say, That's capitalism.\n\nWhat else are we gonna do?\n\nWhat is a life well lived for Bryan Johnson?\n\nNot dying.\n\nPeople evaluate my life\n\nand they say, Bro is so busy trying to not die,\n\nhe ain't living.\n\nThey do say that.\n\nAnd then next they say,\n\nI wish he would get hit by a bus.\n\nLike, they're so upset.\n\n[Katie] Have not seen them say that, but I believe it.\n\nIt's, like, LOL, can't wait till he gets hit by a bus.\n\nBut they're so upset for a variety of reasons,\n\nwhether they can't make the change themself,\n\nwhether they feel like they've been wronged,\n\nwhether they don't have the willpower.\n\nAnd I get it, I've been there,\n\nso I'm not blaming them,\n\nbut they go through this response\n\nwhere they're having to reconcile\n\nthat they are not the person they wanna be\n\nand someone else is doing something that they're not.\n\nAnd so they're going through some kind\n\nof reconciliation process.\n\nThey go through the other five stages of grief.\n\nAnd so I understand why people\n\nhave a such a strong reaction to me.\n\nI get it.\n\nLike, I've been there before,\n\nand it's a very helpless feeling.\n\nBryan, thank you for your time.\n\nI'm really glad you came.\n\nYeah, it's nice to be hanging out with you.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[gentle music]", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"say\", \"know\", \"think\", \"trying\", \"im\", \"johnson\", \"forever\", \"life\", \"bryan\", \"sort\", \"live\", \"wants\", \"really\", \"eating\", \"lot\"]", "content_hash": "936288b921df7ea6d53395de124ee4262c7ed1a090f928666b2e504b63999dc6", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:54:08.650965+00:00"}
{"url": "https://www.wired.com/video/watch/incognito-mode-does-airport-security-even-work", "title": "Does Airport Security Even Work?", "authors": "[\"Condé Nast\"]", "published": null, "text": "Transcript\n\nWhen you go to the airport, you're likely being surveilled\n\nmore than anywhere else in your life.\n\nAirports are really where the trade-offs\n\nbetween security and privacy come into focus.\n\n2015 and 2017, Homeland Security found\n\nthat TSA failed to stop mock explosives 95% of the time,\n\nso are these current safety measures truly effective?\n\nThis is Incognito Mode.\n\n[tenebrous music]\n\n[machinery clicks]\n\nOne thing that we assume is just part of flying\n\nis going through a body scanner,\n\nbut body scanners have only been in place since 2010,\n\nthat's not really that long ago,\n\nand they're really only there because of one guy.\n\nIn 2009, a man accused of being a terrorist\n\nflew into Detroit on Flight 253,\n\npacked with powerful explosives in his underwear.\n\nThe man attempted to detonate the bomb\n\nwhile the plane was descending into Detroit,\n\nbut it only caught fire and didn't actually explode.\n\nThis man flew from Yemen to Nigeria to the Netherlands\n\nand then to the United States,\n\nand at no point was he detected.\n\nIt's for this reason\n\nthat we all have to go through body scanners.\n\nSo, what do TSA agents see\n\nwhen you go through a body scanner?\n\n[Narrator] Technology that can see under your clothes.\n\nUntil 2013, some body scanners used x-ray,\n\nwhich made a very clear image of your nude body\n\nevery time you went through\n\nand TSA agents were able to see this.\n\nThey've since discontinued the use\n\nof the x-ray body scanners\n\nand now use a version that obscures\n\nany sensitive areas on your body.\n\nThe types of body scanners now in use\n\nare millimeter wave scanners.\n\nInstead of showing your real body,\n\nprivacy software creates a 3D doll-like image\n\nand then flags areas that agents might need to check.\n\nHave you ever gone through one of those\n\nand then an area of your body gets flagged\n\nand checked for, like, no apparent reason?\n\nSometimes the machines aren't working\n\nor the line for the machines is too long,\n\nso then you know, an agent will just let a bunch of people\n\narbitrarily go through a metal detector,\n\nwhich is what they used to use,\n\nand then just as arbitrarily,\n\nthey say, Okay, that's all,\n\nand everyone else continue going through the scanner.\n\nSo, all of these things just make you wonder,\n\nwhat are we really catching here\n\nand how airtight is this security?\n\nIt's really hard to prove that something is working\n\nbecause of the absence of something,\n\nand yet it feels intuitive.\n\nLike, we're pretty sure, like,\n\nthis has to be doing something, right?\n\nLike, knowing that you're gonna go through\n\nall the surveillance and pat downs or whatever\n\nwhen you go to the airport\n\nhas to be a deterrent to somebody somewhere.\n\nLike, there's probably been some terrorist attacks\n\nthat didn't happen just because nobody tried\n\nbecause these systems are in place, right?\n\nDeterrence is a valuable tool in, like,\n\na security toolbox,\n\nbut it can't justify all intrusions into privacy,\n\nso, like, we can understand that there's some amount of that\n\nthat is valuable and productive,\n\nbut it doesn't necessarily mean just anything goes.\n\nWe still wanna think about the balance of,\n\nwell, what is that measure that is having a deterrent effect\n\nand is it worth the trade-off?\n\n[tenebrous music]\n\nYou may have seen in the headlines recently\n\nthat facial recognition is expanding\n\nto more and more airports.\n\nFacial recognition is one form of surveillance\n\nthat relies on biometrics.\n\nBiometrics are your personal identifiers,\n\nthink your face, fingerprint,\n\nanything about you that's inherent to who you are,\n\nand that's why people are so concerned\n\nabout biometric surveillance.\n\nThose are things you can't change, can't hide,\n\ncan't do anything about.\n\nYou can imagine how bad it is\n\nif somebody gets your social security number,\n\nbut now imagine they have your fingerprint\n\nor your iris scan,\n\nand that's when it gets into new, uncharted territory.\n\nOnce an entity has that data, that's you forever, right?\n\nIf that organization were to misuse that data,\n\nor if it's stolen or whatever could happen,\n\nonce it's kind of out of your control,\n\nthere's a potential privacy risk\n\nthat just sort of endures through your whole life.\n\nSo, why is this a big deal?\n\nWell, it used to be that all these databases were disparate.\n\nThey didn't all communicate with each other,\n\nthey didn't all share the same data.\n\nThat's starting to change.\n\nWe're gonna have a big, giant database\n\nof everybody's photos, everybody's identities,\n\nand the fact of the matter is we don't really know\n\nhow these systems could be used in the future.\n\nOne of the first rules of privacy and security\n\nis to limit the creation of data in the first place,\n\nand so facial recognition is just another way\n\nof creating more data about you\n\nthat could eventually be abused.\n\nPeople have said for a long time,\n\nWell, what's the point of declining?\n\nyou know, whether it's a face scan\n\nor other types of data collection.\n\nThe government already has all my data anyway, right?\n\nFor many years, the sort of response to that\n\nwas, well, in the U.S.,\n\nyou know, the way the federal government is set up,\n\neach agency's data is siloed from the others.\n\nEven if you had given data to one agency\n\nor particularly, like, a state-level agency,\n\nthat doesn't mean all the federal agencies\n\nor the whole federal government has that information.\n\nYou know, both sides of the aisle,\n\nlike, that has been viewed as a really fundamental right.\n\nAt times, there've been initiatives\n\nto try to do, like, a universal ID within the U.S.\n\nwhere sort of, like, all the checks and everything\n\nwould be built into this one card or document or whatever,\n\nbut there was always pushback to that,\n\nagain, on both sides, but particularly from Republicans\n\nsaying, I don't want the government in my business.\n\nI don't want a, like, central point of control\n\nof knowing who everyone is,\n\nand that's why it has largely remained a state's directive,\n\nbut now like you're saying,\n\nthere's really a movement away from that\n\nin this very sort of casual, like,\n\nwell, now this is happening\n\nand all federal data is being centralized kind of way,\n\ncompletely ignoring the fact\n\nthat there's been literally decades of debate about this.\n\nIn November 2024, a bipartisan group of 12 senators\n\nthat includes Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders\n\nsigned a letter asking the TSA for more information\n\nabout how they're gonna conduct oversight\n\nof the expanding use of facial recognition\n\nat airports across the United States.\n\nThe senators warn that soon,\n\nhundreds of airports will have facial recognition,\n\nbut they also say people aren't aware\n\nthat they're able to opt out.\n\nYou're allowed to tell the TSA,\n\nNo, I don't wanna be subjected to facial recognition,\n\nbut the senators say they've received reports\n\nof travelers encountering belligerent TSA officers\n\nwho don't wanna allow them to opt out,\n\nwhich is their right to do.\n\nWhen a bipartisan group of senators\n\nsends the TSA a letter like this,\n\nyou can tell there's broad concern\n\nover the oversight of TSA facial recognition systems.\n\nThe fact that the senators\n\neven had to send a letter like this\n\njust shows that there's very little information\n\nabout how effective these systems are.\n\nEven though things seem to be moving\n\nin this direction right now,\n\nwhere all this data seems like it's being stockpiled\n\nmore and more by the federal government,\n\nit's still worth being thoughtful,\n\nyou know, declining anything you want to decline\n\nor you feel that you can\n\nbecause there can still be value in that\n\nand you kinda never know which way the wind is gonna blow\n\nand what's gonna happen.\n\nThe data minimization concept still applies.\n\n[machinery clicks]\n\nIf you've been to, like, a major airport recently,\n\nyou've probably had somebody come up and be like,\n\nHey, do you wanna sign up for CLEAR?\n\nDo you wanna skip the line? Yeah, exactly,\n\nand then who doesn't wanna skip the line,\n\nbut this isn't a government agency\n\nthat's operating the system.\n\nThis is a system called CLEAR\n\nand it's run by a third-party company.\n\nAn alternative to CLEAR is the TSA PreCheck program,\n\nwhich is basically the same thing,\n\nbut it's run by the U.S. government.\n\nWhat is the deal with CLEAR\n\nand why is there more issues\n\nwith a third-party company kind of doing this\n\ninstead of just the U.S. government?\n\nWell, when something is a third party,\n\nlike a private company,\n\nconsumers may not have control\n\nover what happens to that data,\n\neither right away,\n\nlike, you've had your face scanned, you know, by this entity\n\nand then maybe, you know,\n\na company is selling it to a third party,\n\nor you know, sharing it with a partner, things like that,\n\nbut there's also been a lot of situations where over time,\n\na company that holds data\n\nis then acquired by another company, goes bankrupt,\n\nor merges with another company\n\nand the data starts to change hands and change hands.\n\nSo, something like CLEAR,\n\nshort-term, it's a way\n\nto get through airport security faster,\n\nbut you're entrusting this durable, non-changeable,\n\nyou know, biometric information with an entity.\n\nYou know, you don't know where that will lead over time.\n\nCLEAR works by scanning various biometrics about you.\n\nThat includes your iris, your fingerprint,\n\nand now they're starting to move\n\ninto full facial recognition.\n\nIn exchange for using CLEAR,\n\nyou're able to get through the line more quickly,\n\nand the company claims\n\nthat using the facial recognition technology\n\nwill speed up things even more.\n\nCLEAR's privacy policy says\n\nthat it will share your information with the government\n\nif authorities issue a subpoena.\n\nThe may also share your information\n\nin connection to an investigation\n\ninto potential illegal activity.\n\nYou're also trusting the company to safeguard your data\n\nand you don't really have much insight\n\ninto how the company's doing that.\n\nCLEAR's not subjected to public records laws\n\nand that means it's a lot harder to get information\n\nabout how the company is storing your data,\n\ntreating that data,\n\nand that they're not abusing it.\n\nCLEAR says, what is it, in 10 minutes or something,\n\nyou can, you know, just sign up here\n\nand you can walk right through,\n\nso it really raises the point of that security screening,\n\ntaking shoes off, taking the laptop out of the bag,\n\nall of those things.\n\nIs that really keeping us safe\n\nif we can so easily skip it?\n\nYeah, and it's also normalizing the acceptance\n\nof additional surveillance in exchange for convenience.\n\nIt's not even exchange for security necessarily,\n\nit's just an exchange for getting through the line faster.\n\nI think that's a great point.\n\nYou know, like we were saying,\n\nwe as a society kind of created this challenge\n\nof long waits at airport security,\n\nand now look, here's this private company\n\nthat will solve it for us.\n\nSo, the worst-case scenario I can see here\n\nis kind of already happening.\n\nLike, CLEAR is not just at airports.\n\nIt's in stadiums, it's in arenas,\n\nand so we're already starting to see this company's mission\n\ncreep out into the rest of the world\n\nand it's becoming tied to the profits of a private company\n\nthat we have absolutely no control\n\nover how they're gonna conduct themselves.\n\nIt's one thing for it to be the government,\n\nwhere you have some say in it in a representative democracy\n\nlike we live in in the United States,\n\nwhereas a private company, you just have no control.\n\nThey're gonna do whatever they're gonna do\n\nand mostly they're gonna do\n\nwhatever's gonna make them the most money\n\nin exchange for our privacy,\n\nand so it's gonna become increasingly invasive.\n\n[machinery clicks]\n\nAnytime you go to an international airport,\n\nyou're technically entering a U.S. border zone.\n\nThis means your devices\n\nmight be subjected to warrantless searches\n\nby Customs and Border Protection agents.\n\nIn January, directly after his inauguration,\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order\n\nallowing agents to conduct enhanced vetting\n\nof anyone entering the United States.\n\nTrump's executive order empowers border agents\n\nto use more aggressive tactics\n\nwhen vetting travelers coming into the United States.\n\nThis might mean pulling people aside\n\ninto interrogation rooms\n\nor searching their devices.\n\nFor example, in early 2025,\n\na French scientist was allegedly denied entry\n\nbecause a border agent found text messages on his phone\n\nthat were critical of Trump and his science policies.\n\nNow, when you're at an airport,\n\nTSA isn't allowed to search through your phone.\n\nIt's only CBP officers that have the authority to do so.\n\nWhile people have become increasingly concerned\n\nabout having their devices searched at the border,\n\nstudies show that since 2021,\n\nthere's only been a 0.1% increase in device searches.\n\nI would say a large number\n\nof the inspections that we have here\n\ndo not include any electronics whatsoever.\n\nIs it within our authority to search those items?\n\nIt is, but we use our discretion\n\nwhen we're looking to use that search parameter.\n\nSo historically, there's no huge cause for concern,\n\nbut that could change.\n\nAnd when we're talking about these device searches,\n\nthere's kind of two levels of a search.\n\nOne is the agent just literally looks through your phone\n\nand you know, some of the advice\n\nis make sure it's on airplane mode\n\nor make sure you just turn it off and stow it away\n\nso they don't think to search it in the first place.\n\nThe other is a lot more invasive. Can you talk about that?\n\nCBP agents could run, like,\n\nmore detailed digital analysis on it,\n\npotentially even remove some of your data\n\nor you know, copy your data off your phone.\n\nIt gives them more ability\n\nto kinda map out, like, your accounts\n\nand start to understand potentially\n\nwhat other data you have stored elsewhere.\n\nSo, that's why that first check,\n\nyou know, when we talk about what might be suspicious,\n\nwhat might raise some red flags\n\nbecause you're in that first search\n\nthat you're talking about,\n\njust sort of a casual flipping through,\n\nyou want everything to look cool and just look chill\n\nbecause then it doesn't need to progress beyond that.\n\nSo, if a CBP officer wants to search your device,\n\ncan you say no?\n\nWell, it depends on who you are.\n\nIf you're a U.S. citizen,\n\nyou can absolutely deny a search of your device.\n\nYour device might be confiscated, you might have some delay,\n\nbut you'll still get in the country.\n\nIf you're a green card holder,\n\nyou may face some types of immigration consequences\n\nfor denying a search of your device.\n\nFor visa holders, they may be refused entry\n\nand have their visas revoked.\n\n[machinery clicks]\n\nFrom the moment you enter a terminal\n\ntill you go to board your flight,\n\nyou're likely being subjected to surveillance from hundreds,\n\nif not thousands of cameras.\n\nThat's something you've probably already thought about.\n\nIt's an airport. Of course you're gonna be monitored.\n\nBut the number of cameras seems to be increasing\n\nat international airports.\n\nAt LAX for example, they recently upped the number\n\nfrom around 1,000 to around 3,000 cameras,\n\nand they have plans to expand that surveillance\n\nto the 10-mile perimeter around the airport.\n\nBut it's not just the number of cameras.\n\nThese devices are also getting enhanced capabilities,\n\nsuch as AI analytics that monitor crowd behavior,\n\nindividual behavior, unauthorized areas, and loitering.\n\nIt's very hard for humans\n\nto grasp when we are being surveilled\n\nby video surveillance nonstop,\n\nand I think the incorporation of AI\n\ninto all of these systems,\n\nit's even harder to grasp the depth\n\nof the analysis and information that can be, you know,\n\nextracted in near real-time\n\nabout just any footage that's coming in.\n\nSo, our instinct is to kinda think,\n\nwell, okay, even if we can understand\n\nthere's all those cameras everywhere, which is hard enough,\n\nthen it's like, Yeah,\n\nbut nobody can be watching everything all the time,\n\nbut AI actually makes it more possible.\n\nLet's say an AI system,\n\nthis can happen anywhere, but an AI system in an airport\n\ndetermined that you were acting suspicious.\n\nLike, Oh, Andrew has a suspicious walk\n\nin the terminal today.\n\nYou know, that is a very subjective decision,\n\nso you know, as AI is integrated\n\ninto more and more systems,\n\nthese are the types of things\n\nthat we all need to be aware of, and be conscious of,\n\nand be, you know, making proactive decisions as a society\n\nrather than just allowing things\n\nto kind of drift where they will.\n\nWe should address that. We shouldn't just leave that.\n\n[machinery clicks] [tenebrous music]\n\nAirports weren't always like this.\n\nIt's only since the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks\n\nthat the U.S. really ramped up security at airports.\n\nTSA's 2025 budget is $11.8 billion,\n\nand according to one poll,\n\nthree in four Americans say they trust the TSA\n\nto keep them safe.\n\nIs it important to take measures to keep everybody safe?\n\nOf course, absolutely.\n\nSecurity is paramount, especially at airports,\n\nbut do we really need to be throwing out our water bottles\n\nevery time we go through airport security?\n\nMaybe not.\n\nThere may be other ways to do this that are better,\n\nboth for our security and for our privacy.\n\nA big criticism of TSA and airport security checkpoints\n\nis that they aren't really effective a lot of the time\n\nand that the core thing that's happening\n\nis what's called security theater:\n\nthis ruse to make everyone feel better\n\nthat isn't necessarily doing anything.\n\nYeah, whether the TSA is popular or not, I don't know,\n\nbut people definitely want good security at airports.\n\nIf it's achieving that goal, that's great.\n\nI think it's hard to know\n\nwhether it's actually achieving that goal,\n\nand so I think that's problematic on two fronts.\n\nOne, because that raises the possibility\n\nof something bad happening\n\nand it making all of the surveillance\n\nand intrusions that we're subjected to at the airport\n\nkind of for naught,\n\nand the other is that we're giving up a ton of privacy\n\nto have something that's not really working\n\nthe way that it should,\n\nand so I think there needs to be a lot more clarity\n\nin terms of how effective each and every system and process\n\nthat the TSA subjects the public to is\n\nand whether or not it's actually increasing our safety\n\nor whether it's just making us feel better.\n\nYeah, and I think that's a really good point\n\nthat it isn't all or nothing.\n\nEach component can and should be evaluated\n\nto see how effective it is.\n\nSome could be taken away, some could be added.\n\nIt doesn't have to be in one direction or the other,\n\nbut if we're going to kind of create a problem\n\nand a whole industry around airport security,\n\nit needs to actually be accomplishing the goal.\n\nYou know, it's important to say that, like,\n\na lot of this in the U.S.\n\ncame from the September 11th attacks,\n\nand so there was, like, a real tragedy\n\nand a real reason behind all of this concern\n\nand trying to step up security,\n\nbut just because there's a good reason to consider\n\nor reconsider the security of something\n\nand how you implement that,\n\nyou know, it doesn't necessarily mean\n\nthat where things have landed is the best way.\n\nYeah, exactly, and I mean, I am very sympathetic\n\nto people being okay with surveillance\n\nto avoid terrorist attacks.\n\nI mean, we both lived in New York City on September 11th.\n\nWe are filming this right now in the World Trade Center.\n\nThe footprints of the old World Trade Center\n\nare literally right behind us,\n\nand so, you know, we're well aware\n\nof the consequences of security failures,\n\nbut that doesn't mean that we need to live in a world\n\nwhere intense surveillance any time you travel\n\nis just how it has to be.\n\n[machinery clicks]\n\nSo, what can you do if you're traveling through an airport\n\nand you wanna protect your privacy?\n\nUnfortunately, there's not much,\n\nbut there are a few steps you can take.\n\nOne, know your rights.\n\nThis is gonna change depending on who you are,\n\nwhat your immigration status is,\n\nand exactly where you're traveling,\n\nbut just make sure you're up to speed\n\non what agents can and cannot do.\n\nTwo, use a dedicated travel phone.\n\nThis is a device that is only gonna have things on it\n\nthat you're comfortable an agent searching through.\n\nAnd third, don't sign up for CLEAR or other systems like it,\n\nand opt out of facial recognition.\n\nNo matter how belligerent the agent gets,\n\nyou can always say no.\n\nThis was Incognito Mode.

"published": null, "text": "Transcript\n\nI'm Stephen Vladeck,\n\nauthor and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nI'm here today to answer your questions from the internet.\n\nThis is Supreme Court Support.\n\n[lively music]\n\n@Cryptoking asks,\n\nWhy do Supreme Court justices receive life appointments\n\nwhile every other type of judge has retirement ages?\n\nSo this is actually a real disconnect\n\nbetween the federal courts and state courts.\n\nMost states have imposed retirement ages\n\non their judges and justices.\n\nThe federal courts have not.\n\nAnd so under Article III of the Federal Constitution,\n\nthe Supreme Court,\n\nthe intermediate federal courts of appeals,\n\nthe 94 federal district courts, all of them served\n\nduring what the Constitution calls good behavior.\n\nAnd the idea here was to provide a modicum\n\nof protection against being forced off the bench\n\nfor anything other than the kind of misconduct\n\nthat might warrant impeachment\n\nby the House of Representatives and removal by the Senate.\n\n@kpolaprateek asks,\n\nSo how do Supreme Court justices get appointed?\n\nThe appointments process is actually pretty straightforward.\n\nThe president gets to nominate anyone,\n\ndoesn't matter how old they are, where they're from,\n\nwhat their qualifications are,\n\nto be a Supreme Court justice,\n\nand as long as they're confirmed\n\nby a majority of the Senate, they got the job.\n\nVAWNavyVet asks, Are confirmation hearings effective\n\nin preventing unqualified appointments\n\nor have they become mere formalities?\n\nYou know, this really does vary\n\nand has varied historically based upon who the President is\n\nand based upon which party controls the Senate.\n\nThere have been moments in American history\n\nwhere the Senate really has exercised\n\na rigorous oversight role.\n\nIn vetting the Supreme Court's nominees,\n\nthere have been some who have been blocked by the Senate,\n\nsome who were withdrawn\n\n'cause they didn't have the votes in the Senate.\n\nBut I think what we've seen lately\n\nis when the presidents of the same party\n\nas a majority of the Senate, there really is a push\n\nto get through the President's nominees.\n\nAnd so I think we've seen less of that criticism\n\nfrom the Senate in recent nomination processes.\n\nProfessional_Cat_437, Could somebody explain\n\nwhat the 2016 drama of Obama being unable\n\nto appoint a new Supreme Court justice was?\n\nSo in February of 2016, Justice Antonin Scalia,\n\nwho was in many respects the leader\n\nof the court's then extinct four conservative justice wing\n\nunexpectedly passed away while he was on the court,\n\nopening up a seat for President Obama to presumably fill.\n\nPresident Obama quickly nominated an incredibly moderate\n\nand relatively older candidates,\n\nthen DC Circuit Judge Merrick Garland, but the Republicans\n\nwho at the time had a majority in the Senate banded together\n\nand committed to provide no process,\n\nnot even to have a vote up or down\n\non Merrick Garland as a nominee,\n\nbut rather to keep that seat open\n\nthrough the November, 2016 presidential election\n\nuntil President Trump was sworn in in January,\n\nat which point he nominated Neil Gorsuch\n\nand the Senate confirmed Gorsuch to fill that seat.\n\nSo the Constitution does not require the Senate to vote.\n\nReally historically, the expectation has been\n\nthat if the Senate were going to shirk its duty\n\nin such a shameless and transparent way,\n\nit would face political consequences for doing so.\n\nIf anything, in 2016, the opposite happened\n\nwhere the Senate holding that seat open\n\nprovided a number of folks\n\nwho might not otherwise have wanted to\n\nwith reasons to vote for President Trump.\n\nIt's also worth keeping in mind\n\nthat when the Constitution was written,\n\nwe didn't have political parties.\n\nHad the founders known that we were gonna have\n\nreally a deeply entrenched two party system,\n\nit's not hard to imagine\n\nthey would've done some things very differently.\n\n@DannyjeGga asks, The Supreme Court is not apolitical.\n\nHas it ever been?\n\nWe should distinguish here between a court that is political\n\nand the court that is partisan.\n\nThe Supreme Court has always been political\n\nin the sense that it's always been involved\n\nin institutional conversations\n\nwith the other branches of government.\n\nSome of the court's most important early decisions\n\ncome as part of a pretty sophisticated\n\ninner branch conversation\n\nwith President Jefferson with Congress.\n\nIt's only since 2010 that we have a Supreme Court\n\nwhere every justices' ideology\n\naligns with the party of the President who appointed them.\n\nThat's part of why today the court\n\nseems so much more divided along partisan lines\n\nthan was true as recently as 20 years ago.\n\nFrom Reddit, How does the process\n\nof a court case going to the Supreme Court work?\n\nJust about every case the Supreme Court hears\n\nhas gone through multiple levels\n\nof litigation in lower courts.\n\nThose lower courts could be lower federal courts\n\nor they could be state courts.\n\nAnd under both the Constitution\n\nand the relevant statutes Congress has passed,\n\nonce the case has gone through those lower courts,\n\nthe Supreme Court has the power to hear an appeal\n\nif whoever lost in the lower courts\n\nwants the court to do so.\n\nAnd if it's coming from a lower state court,\n\nas long as there's a federal issue in the case,\n\nas long as the case turns on federal law,\n\nthe Supreme Court has the power to hear it.\n\nThis is actually a place where the Supreme Court's power\n\nand its docket has actually shifted a lot over time.\n\nSo from 1789 when the Supreme Court was created until 1891,\n\nthe Supreme Court actually had to hear every single appeal\n\nthat Congress told it to.\n\nIt's only since 1891\n\nthat Congress has broadly given the justices\n\nthe power to pick and choose\n\nalmost all of the cases they hear.\n\nThat process is given this Latin term certiorari,\n\nwhich we abbreviate to cert 'cause we can't really spell it,\n\nand the basic gist is the Supreme Court votes\n\nand it takes four of the nine justices\n\nto agree to hear a case for the court to take it up.\n\nWhat that means, perhaps, surprisingly,\n\nis that actually almost all of the cases\n\nthe Supreme Court decides these days\n\nare cases that the justices have specifically chosen to hear\n\nand not just cases that were foisted upon them.\n\n@CS_Westbrook asks, Do you know approximately\n\nhow many cases the Supreme Court takes every year?\n\nThe Supreme Court receives\n\nsomewhere between 4,500 and 6,000 requests every year\n\nto hear appeals, whether from the lower federal courts\n\nor from the state courts.\n\nIt only takes about 65 or 70 of them.\n\nWhat that means is that in 98 to 99% of those cases,\n\nit's actually those lower courts that get the last word\n\nand the justices leave those lower court decisions intact.\n\nSo the process the Supreme Court follows\n\nfor picking and choosing cases is very secretive,\n\nbut basically the parties file briefs\n\nwhere the party that wants the Supreme Court\n\nto hear the case says, Here's why you should take it.\n\nThe party that one below says,\n\nNo, here's why you shouldn't take it.\n\nAnd the justices and their clerks debate internally\n\nwhat to do and they ultimately vote,\n\nshould we hear this case or not?\n\n@KenHicken asks, Yes or no.\n\nCan the Supreme Court be expanded?\n\nYes, the Constitution does not provide any limit\n\non the size of the Supreme Court.\n\nIt gives that power to Congress.\n\nCongress used that power a number of times between 1789\n\nand 1869 to change the size of the Supreme Court.\n\nIt's really a question about politics,\n\nwhether it's a good idea and whether there are the votes.\n\nAnd at least since 1869, the answer to one,\n\nif not both of those questions, has consistently been no.\n\nAn anonymous Reddit user asks,\n\nWhat's the purpose of dissenting opinions?\n\nSometimes a justice will write a dissenting opinion\n\nto make clear to their colleagues\n\njust how wrong they think the majority is.\n\nIndeed, we have examples of a proposed dissenting opinion,\n\nactually persuaded enough justices that it's correct\n\nthat it became the majority opinion.\n\nSometimes the goal of a dissenting opinion\n\nis to lay down a marker so that even if the Supreme Court's\n\nnot gonna reach the right answer, maybe other actors can.\n\nA famous example of this is when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\n\nwrote a dissent in a case called Ledbetter about pay equity\n\nthat called on Congress to fix the relevant federal statutes\n\nwith regard to pay equity in the workplace.\n\nCongress did and it actually passed a statute\n\ncalled the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act\n\nin response to justice Ginsburg's dissenting opinion.\n\nAnd sometimes dissents really are meant more for the public\n\nwhere the dissenting justice understands\n\nthat they don't have enough votes\n\nfor their position on the court,\n\nbut they're writing for posterity.\n\nThey think that one day the law will catch up with them.\n\nAnd some of the great examples of this\n\nare from Justice John Marshall Harlan,\n\nwho dissented in cases like Plessy versus Ferguson,\n\nwhich established the principle of separate but equal\n\nin a way that actually we now rely upon\n\nthat has largely become the law of the land.\n\n@real_miss_kim asks,\n\nWhich Supreme Court Justice retires next?\n\nAnd who replaces him or her?\n\nSo if history has taught us anything,\n\nit's that it's not always who you'd expect.\n\nI think for obvious reasons,\n\nmost of the attention right now\n\nis on justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito\n\nsince they are two of the three longest serving\n\nRepublican appointed justices on the court\n\nand the ones who I think would be most willing\n\nto have President Trump pick their successors.\n\nBut Justice Thomas is also just a couple years away\n\nfrom the all time longevity record.\n\nFor Supreme Court justice\n\nis something I suspect he's interested in.\n\nIf you really forced me to bet,\n\nI would say Justice Alito is probably at the top of the list\n\nfor the next justice to retire.\n\nBut, you know, I'm glad\n\nI don't have to put any real money on it.\n\nWeary-Farmer-4894 asks, Did RBG destroy her legacy\n\nby not retiring during Obama's presidency?\n\nYou know, this is a real debate,\n\nnot just about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\n\nbut about what a Supreme Court justice's\n\ncentral obligations are.\n\nFamously, Justice Ginsburg did not retire\n\nwhen President Obama was in office\n\nand Democrats controlled the Senate.\n\nAnd that meant that when she passed away\n\nafter a long battle with cancer, in September, 2020,\n\nit was President Trump who was able to fill her seat\n\nas he did with Justice Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nI think it's really tricky to think about this question\n\nbecause retiring solely for partisan political purposes,\n\neven if it's something that justices do,\n\nis maybe not in the best long-term interest\n\nof the institution.\n\nIf we view the court through the lens\n\nof just who controls which seats,\n\nthen we really are accepting the premise\n\nthat the court is a partisan institution\n\nand not just a judicial one.\n\nAt the same time,\n\njustices who care about their legacies have to care,\n\nespecially in this day and age,\n\nabout those partisan politics.\n\nOnly a justice knows their body,\n\nonly a justice knows their mind,\n\nbut I think it certainly looks in retrospect\n\nlike it probably would've been better for Justice Ginsburg\n\nif she cared about such things,\n\nto step down when President Obama\n\ncould have chosen her successor instead of President Trump.\n\n@PoBoyReeves asks,\n\nHow ugly was the Kavanaugh confirmation?\n\nIt was pretty ugly.\n\nThere were seemingly quite plausible charges\n\nof sexual misconduct on the part\n\nof a much, much younger Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nYou had a rushed FBI report\n\nand you had I think a fair amount of railroading\n\non both sides to the fight\n\nover who would replace justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nAnd then we have to remember that part\n\nof what was going on there, was you had the Justice\n\nwho had become the median vote on the court.\n\nIt was his seat that was at issue,\n\nand I think that's part of why\n\nyou saw the emotions get so high.\n\nHow do we fix that?\n\nWell, I think this is a larger\n\nand deeper conversation about our institutions\n\nand about pushing presidents, pushing senators,\n\npushing everybody to a point\n\nwhere we view the courts in general\n\nand the Supreme Court in particular\n\nas a critically important check\n\non the other branches of government,\n\na check where we're gonna want judges and justices\n\nnot just who believe things we agree with,\n\nbut who are going to assert the power of the courts\n\nover the other branches of government.\n\nThat to me is the real unfortunate consequence\n\nof the Kavanaugh confirmation, is that if anything\n\nthat's moved us more into our political corners\n\nand not more toward\n\nthat kind of institutional understanding.\n\n@theylove_sierra, How did Plessy versus Ferguson\n\nchange law and society?\n\nSo Plessy versus Ferguson is the infamous 1896 decision\n\nin which the Supreme Court articulated the separate\n\nbut equal understanding\n\nfor racial discrimination in public places.\n\nYou can draw a straight line from Plessy versus Ferguson\n\nto the era of Jim Crow, to the idea\n\nthat you would have segregated drinking facilities,\n\nsegregated schools, segregated bathrooms\n\nin cities and jurisdictions,\n\nespecially throughout the south.\n\nI think there's a debate\n\nabout just how much Plessy itself caused those changes\n\nor how much Plessy at least meant the courts\n\nhad no way to stop those changes,\n\nwhich in many respects were already well underway.\n\nIndeed, it wouldn't be\n\nuntil Brown versus Board of Education in 1954\n\nand the Civil Rights Movement\n\nthat Brown was an early part of\n\nthat you really see efforts to push back against\n\nto dismantle Jim Crow.\n\nThe Supreme Court's obviously part of that story.\n\nIt's probably a little much to say\n\nthat the court was solely responsible for it.\n\n@SteveO2385 asks, When did the left\n\never have control of SCOTUS?\n\nSeriously, when was the last time\n\nthere was a liberal majority?\n\nSo I think there's actually some debate about this\n\nbecause until 2010, you had a long history\n\nof Supreme Court appointments\n\nthat were not necessarily party and ideology aligned.\n\nFor example, Justice William Brennan, who for a long time\n\nwas the liberal lion of the Warren Court,\n\nwas appointed by a Republican president,\n\nby Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nThe last time that a majority of the Supreme Court\n\nincluded justices appointed by Democratic presidents,\n\nwhich might be one way to think about this question,\n\nwas May 14th, 1969.\n\nThat was the day on which Justice Abe Fortas\n\nresigned from the court.\n\nActually Republican presidents\n\nwould have the next 11 appointments to the Supreme Court,\n\nwhich is a big part\n\nof why there was such this profound shift\n\nin the court's jurisprudence started in 1970.\n\nReddit user asked, At the time of Roe versus Wade,\n\nwas the Supreme Court overwhelmingly liberal?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nI mean, the Supreme Court in 1973\n\nwhen Roe versus Wade was decided\n\nwas in some respects a court in transition.\n\nAnd so you had a seven to two majority in that case,\n\nbut there were multiple justices in the majority\n\nwho had been appointed by Republican presidents,\n\nand one of the two dissenters, Justice Byron White,\n\nwas actually a democratic appointee.\n\nHe was appointed by President John F. Kennedy.\n\nAt the time Roe versus Wade was decided,\n\nthe question of the constitutionality\n\nof protections for abortion\n\njust didn't quite divide us so strictly\n\ninto ideological camps\n\nas it came to in the years and decades to follow.\n\n@koreflautas asks,\n\nHow did Citizens United affect elections?\n\nSo the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United\n\nis actually part of a larger series of decisions\n\nin which the Supreme Court\n\nhas interpreted the First Amendment\n\nto prohibit a number of restrictions on campaign finance\n\nand to prohibit a number\n\nof campaign finance reform initiatives enacted by Congress.\n\nThe result has been a much larger amount\n\nof dark money in our elections, local elections,\n\nstate elections, federal elections.\n\nThe real impact here\n\nis not that it's obviously pro-Republican or pro-Democratic.\n\nIt's pro-money.\n\nMoney interests have had much more say\n\nin our elections in the last 15 or 20 years.\n\nCertainly then was true for a long time before that.\n\n@jsc1835 asks, Trump is asking the Supreme Court\n\nto partly allow birthright citizenship restrictions.\n\nWill the Supreme Court allow this\n\nbreach of the Constitution?\n\nThis is getting a bit into the weeds,\n\nbut one of the things that's really tricky\n\nabout the three birthright citizenship cases\n\nthat the Supreme Court is deciding during its current term\n\nis that the court is being asked not to uphold the policy\n\nbut rather just to let it go into effect\n\nas applied to at least some people\n\nthrough a procedural debate.\n\nBasically the argument is the lower courts ruled too broadly\n\nin blocking President Trump's efforts\n\nto limit birthright citizenship.\n\nI suspect that the court is going to narrow\n\nthose lower court rulings in at least some way,\n\nbut also that either the Supreme Court\n\nor the lower courts pretty quickly\n\nare gonna reach the end of this case\n\nand rule conclusively that the president's efforts\n\nto limit birthright citizenship are in fact unlawful,\n\nwhich will mitigate the effect of a procedural ruling\n\nthat makes those lower court decisions less effective.\n\n@julietfes asks, In the country's history,\n\nhas a Supreme Court justice ever resigned?\n\nSo a number have resigned.\n\nPerhaps the most notorious resignation was in 1969\n\nwhen Justice Abe Fortas resigned\n\nbecause of alleged improprieties\n\nwith a financier named Louis Wolfson.\n\nBut there actually have been a number of justices\n\nwho have resigned for other reasons, for health reasons,\n\nfor personal reasons, in some cases\n\nbecause they wanted or were appointed to different jobs.\n\nIt's really only in the last 10 or 15 years\n\nthat we've seen high profile deaths by sitting justices.\n\nWe actually had gone a very long time.\n\nFrom 1954 to 2005,\n\nthere wasn't a single justice who died on the bench.\n\nThe norm had become resigned before.\n\nThe actuarial tables catch up with you.\n\n@thedrivein47 asks,\n\nWhat are the duties of the chief justice?\n\nSo the chief justice is in some respects\n\nthe first among equals.\n\nHe doesn't have special extra powers\n\nthat the other eight justices lack.\n\nWhat makes him special is he is the senior justice.\n\nHe basically presides over all of the court sessions.\n\nHe gets to decide whenever he's in the majority\n\nwho's gonna write the decision for the court.\n\nAnd he is in various respects the ceremonial figurehead\n\nof the judicial branch\n\nas set out in Article III of the Constitution.\n\nBut when the justices are in their conference room\n\nand they're voting on cases,\n\nthe chief justice really is just one of nine.\n\n@christo53294495 ask, Can you tell me in US history\n\nwhich president has appointed a justice\n\nrepresenting the opposite of his beliefs?\n\nPerhaps the most famous of these is President Eisenhower\n\nappointing Justice William Brennan in 1956,\n\nis a Catholic democratic state court judge from New Jersey,\n\nnot because of his ideology, but perhaps despite it.\n\nBut in general, I mean, really until the 1950s and 1960s,\n\nthere are a lot of examples throughout American history\n\nof president's prioritizing geographical diversity,\n\nother types of experience,\n\nof presidents cashing in political chips,\n\nor even in some cases of presidents\n\nusing Supreme Court appointments\n\nto neutralize the folks they were, you know, rivals with.\n\nIt's really only in the last generation\n\nthat we've come to think of Supreme Court appointments\n\nas being purely about maximizing ideology.\n\nA Reddit user asks,\n\nWhy did LBJ nominate Thurgood Marshall?\n\nJustice Marshall, when he was nominated\n\nto the court in 1967, was the first justice\n\nin the court's history who was not white,\n\nand this was a really important step by President Johnson.\n\nPresident thought it was long past time\n\nthat the Supreme Court have a Black justice.\n\nIndeed, he actually manipulates the circumstances\n\njust to create a seat for Justice Marshall.\n\nHe took Ramsey Clark, who was the son\n\nof a sitting Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark,\n\nand he appointed Ramsey Clark as the Attorney General.\n\nThat would have meant Tom Clark would've had to recuse\n\nfrom every case in which the federal government was a party.\n\nLBJ knew he wouldn't do that.\n\nLBJ knew that Tom Clark would resign from the court,\n\nthereby creating the seat for Thurgood Marshall.\n\n@punycitizen asks, How does the shadow docket work?\n\nThe shadow docket is a term that was coined\n\nby a University of Chicago law professor Will Baude in 2015,\n\nand it was meant to describe everything\n\nthat the Supreme Court does other than the 65 or so cases.\n\nIt decides after briefing an argument every year.\n\nSo that includes all of the rulings\n\nwhere the Supreme Court declines to take up an appeal\n\nand it includes this other chunk of decisions\n\nwhere the Supreme Court is asked\n\nto provide something called emergency relief.\n\nEmergency relief is when you have a case in the lower courts\n\nthat has not gotten to the Supreme Court yet,\n\nbut one party, presumably whoever lost below,\n\nwants to change the status quo\n\nwhile the case works its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd that's become an increasingly prominent part\n\nof the Supreme Court's workload.\n\nIt's why the shadow docket has become so much more,\n\nI think, a subject of popular interest,\n\nespecially as we've seen\n\nduring the second Trump administration,\n\nso many cases where the federal government\n\nis asking the Supreme Court\n\nto temporarily pause lower court rulings\n\nblocking various policies\n\nwhile those cases worked their way through the courts.\n\nA Reddit user asked,\n\nWhat was the first Second Amendment Supreme Court case?\n\nReally, the first time the Supreme Court\n\ndiscussed the Second Amendment in detail was in the 1930s\n\nin a case called Miller where the court basically said\n\nthat the Second Amendment\n\ndidn't protect an individual right to self-defense.\n\nIt was mostly a collective right\n\nto resist tyrannical government.\n\nOf course, it was that understanding\n\nthat the Supreme Court overruled.\n\nIn 2008, since the Supreme Court's decision\n\nin its five four decision in Heller,\n\nwhat we've seen is a lot more litigation challenging\n\nand succeeding in striking down limits on gun sales,\n\ngun possession across the country.\n\nyukicola asks, What do the US Supreme Court justices\n\nactually do during a regular workday?\n\nMost of the justices work goes on in their chambers.\n\nIn the Supreme Court's official headquarters in Washington,\n\na building, by the way, the court has only had since 1935,\n\nthe justices each have their own chambers,\n\nthey have their own staffs, they have four law clerks\n\nwho are recent law school graduates,\n\nand of course they have administrative support as well.\n\nAnd most of what they're doing is reviewing cases,\n\neither which cases they're going to choose to hear or not,\n\nor in the subset of cases the justices have chosen to hear,\n\nreading the briefs, preparing for argument,\n\nwriting opinions, reviewing other justices' opinions.\n\nThe justices really only gather in person formally\n\nwhen they're on the hearing arguments\n\nor handing down decisions\n\nor when they are back in what's called their conference,\n\nwhere they decide how they're gonna rule on specific cases.\n\nBlanckToHideFromWife,\n\nCan the US Supreme Court in practice make law?\n\nThis has been really a bit of a metaphysical debate\n\namong scholars for a very long time.\n\nEveryone agrees that judges\n\nand the Supreme Court in particular\n\nhave a responsibility to interpret the law.\n\nThe difference between that\n\nand what we might call making law is often elusive.\n\nAnd actually there are contexts in which we expect judges\n\nto do more than just resolve ambiguity,\n\nperhaps to fill in language that Congress\n\nor the state legislature has left out.\n\nSo yes, I mean I think there are lots of contexts\n\nin which the judges and justices\n\nare and should be allowed to make law.\n\nWe just tend to think of those in the context\n\nof interpreting statutes, constitutional provisions,\n\nand other legal texts.\n\nHagisman asks, Ideally, should the Supreme Court\n\nlean toward originalism or living constitutionalism?\n\nThis is an age old debate about how judges and justices\n\nshould interpret the text of the Constitution\n\nwhen that text is ambiguous.\n\nNo one really disputes that when the Constitution\n\nsays the President has to be 35 years old, it means 35.\n\nBut when the Eighth Amendment says something\n\nlike there can be no such thing as cruel\n\nand unusual punishment, that of course raises questions.\n\nWhat makes a particular punishment cruel and unusual?\n\nThroughout the court's history,\n\none of the ways we've addressed this issue\n\nis by having justices who were diverse,\n\nwho were from different parts of the country,\n\nwho are from different backgrounds,\n\nwho had different methodological commitments.\n\nAnd it's really only in the last generation\n\nthat there has been this concerted push toward the idea\n\nthat there really can only be one accepted way\n\nto interpret the Constitution.\n\nI'll just say that I think the better answer\n\nis different people are gonna have different commitments\n\nbased upon their own views, their own experiences,\n\ntheir own background,\n\nand part of why we have nine Supreme Court justices\n\nand not just one, part of why we have humans\n\ninterpreting these texts and not machines,\n\nis because those differences,\n\nthat diversity is actually a really important part\n\nof the project of legal interpretation.\n\n@DJvsEverybody asks, How do state's rights\n\nfit into having the Supreme Court\n\nhave the ability to overrule state courts?\n\nThe Constitution divides sovereignty\n\nbetween the federal government and the states.\n\nOne of the ways it does so\n\nis it leaves questions of state law\n\nup to state Supreme Court.\n\nSo if the Missouri Supreme Court\n\ninterprets Missouri law in a particular way,\n\nthe Supreme Court has no power to disagree with them.\n\nThe difference is when it's about federal law.\n\nAnd so if a state court interprets a federal statute\n\nor the federal constitution\n\nor if a state court interprets state law\n\nin a way that is inconsistent with federal law\n\nor the federal constitution,\n\nthat's where the US Supreme Court is able to come in\n\nand is able to reverse that decision.\n\namwreck asks, How does the Supreme Court\n\ngo about overturning a previous ruling?\n\nIt's actually not that complicated procedurally.\n\nIt's just fraught in the sense\n\nthat it tends to be controversial\n\nwhen the Supreme Court overturns a prior decision.\n\nThere's nothing that actually prevents any justices\n\nin any case from saying,\n\nHey, we actually think this prior decision is wrong\n\nand should be overruled.\n\nYou need a majority, of course,\n\nand presumably you need some compelling reason\n\nwhy that older decision should be overruled.\n\nThe principle of stare decisis is the idea\n\nthat all things being equal,\n\ncourt should follow the decisions of their predecessors.\n\nIf and when there are especially persuasive reasons\n\nto overrule a prior precedent,\n\nthat's when the court is I think more free to do so.\n\nkwertix asks, Why does the US Supreme Court\n\nrely on presidential cases?\n\nThis isn't just the US Supreme Court.\n\nThis is actually a feature\n\nof any so-called common law legal system.\n\nAnd the idea is that precedent is itself part of our law,\n\nthat what separates judges\n\nand justices from ordinary politicians\n\nis that they're not just voting their preferences\n\nin every individual case,\n\nthat there is actually this abstract idea of what the law is\n\nthat binds not just current judges but future judges\n\nuntil and unless there's some compelling reason\n\nto overrule it.\n\nThat's not just a sort of principle of laziness.\n\nIt's actually a really important foundation\n\nof what separates judicial power\n\nfrom ordinary political power.\n\n@Andrevin20, Do I think the Supreme Court\n\nwas always nine seats?\n\nHow did it get to nine?\n\nIn fact, I know it wasn't.\n\nThe Constitution itself says nothing\n\nabout how big the Supreme Court ought to be.\n\nCongress, when it created the court in 1789,\n\nstarted with a very strange number with six.\n\nThat was really based\n\non how many lower appeals courts there were.\n\nBetween 1789 and 1869,\n\nthe size of the court fluctuates seven times\n\nbetween as many as 10 justices\n\nfor a brief period in the 1860s\n\nand at one point as few as five justices.\n\nIt's only in April of 1869\n\nthat Congress for the first time hardwires the number nine\n\ninto the identity of the Supreme Court\n\nand we've been set at nine ever since.\n\nThere have been proposals at various points\n\nin the recent past,\n\nespecially during the Biden administration,\n\nto pack the court by adding perhaps four seats.\n\nPractically, you're never gonna be able to do it\n\nunless the same party simultaneously controls\n\nnot just the White House, but both chambers of Congress\n\nand has a filibuster proof majority in the Senate.\n\nAnd in the long-term,\n\nI mean, if you're expanding the court solely\n\nto maximize short-term partisan political advantage,\n\nI think that probably re-downs to the detriment\n\nof the integrity of the court, of public faith in the court,\n\neven if part of why folks are proposing that as a reform\n\nis because they think that damage has already happened.\n\nI'm not sure this is an example\n\nof two wrongs making the right.\n\n@myopinion6810 asks,\n\nHow do Supreme Court justices get impeached?\n\nHas that ever happened?\n\nSo it's the exact same process in the Constitution\n\nfor impeaching a Supreme Court justice\n\nas it is for the President.\n\nIt takes a majority\n\nof the House of Representatives to impeach,\n\ntwo-thirds of the Senate to vote to convict\n\nand thereby remove.\n\nIt's happened exactly once with the Supreme Court Justice.\n\nIn 1804, the sort of Jeffersonian controlled Congress\n\nimpeached and tried to remove Justice Samuel Chase,\n\nwho has perhaps the greatest nickname\n\nin Supreme Court history.\n\nHe was known as Old Bacon Face.\n\nAnd Justice Chase was impeached because the Jeffersonians\n\nthought that he was basically a partisan hack.\n\nBut the Senate refused to remove Justice Chase.\n\nIt wasn't that they decided that he was not a partisan.\n\nIt was that they decided that wasn't enough,\n\nand that to remove a Supreme Court justice,\n\nyou need actual misconduct.\n\nAnd that's really stood as a pretty important precedent\n\nfor judicial independence ever since.\n\nOdd-Flower2744, What actually happens\n\nif Supreme Court decisions are just ignored?\n\nWhat mechanisms actually enforce a Supreme Court decision?\n\nIt depends on who's doing the ignoring.\n\nOf course, if it's private parties, there are lots of ways\n\nto compel their obedience to Supreme Court decisions,\n\nwhether it's monetary sanctions or otherwise.\n\nIt is, of course, trickier\n\nif the relevant party is the federal government.\n\nHistorically, the way the Supreme Court has been allowed to,\n\nbeen able to effectuate its mandates\n\nis because the political consequences\n\nof a president defy on the Supreme Court\n\nhave just been too high.\n\nPresident Nixon turned over the Watergate tapes,\n\nincluding the tape that led directly to his resignation\n\nbecause he concluded with the support of his advisors\n\nthat he couldn't defy the Supreme Court.\n\nPresident Eisenhower sent the army into Little Rock in 1957\n\nto desegregate Central High School\n\nbecause he was persuaded\n\nthat he couldn't not enforce the Supreme Court decision\n\nin Brown versus Board of Education.\n\nThat's why the Supreme Court's legitimacy\n\nwhy public faith in the court is so important\n\nbecause if we get to a point where a president\n\ncould stick his thumb in the Supreme Court's eye\n\nand have no similar political backlash,\n\nthat would be the point where the Supreme Court's power\n\nas an institution would be critically\n\nand perhaps irrevocably damaged.\n\n@ajebolawyer asks, Do I know the difference\n\nbetween the Supreme Court of a state of the United States\n\nand the Supreme Court of the United States?\n\nIn fact, I do. So every state has a Supreme Court.\n\nActually, Texas and Oklahoma have two,\n\none each for criminal cases and for civil cases,\n\nbut those courts are principally tasked\n\nwith interpreting state law.\n\nSometimes you can have federal issues\n\ncome up in those cases.\n\nA state criminal prosecution, for example,\n\ncan raise Fourth Amendment issues.\n\nBut typically the state Supreme Courts get the last word\n\non the meaning of their state's laws\n\nand the US Supreme Court gets the last word\n\non the meaning of federal law.\n\nA Reddit user asks, What government entity has oversight\n\nover the US Supreme Court\n\nthat's now showing almost open corruption\n\nfrom payments for housing vacations\n\nand payment of schooling for children?\n\nSo this has always been a little tricky.\n\nI mean, the Supreme Court is an independent branch.\n\nIt is not supposed to be subject to oversight\n\nin quite the same ways that maybe lower courts might be\n\nor the executive branch agencies.\n\nHistorically the way this has worked\n\nis there has been a healthy, but sometimes heated,\n\nback and forth between the political branches\n\nand the Supreme Court.\n\nCongress controls the Supreme Court's budget,\n\nCongress controls the Supreme Court's docket,\n\nand those have been levers\n\nthat historically Congress has pulled\n\nas a way of pushing on the justices to behave better.\n\nOne of the things that has really happened\n\nin the last 25 or 30 years that has gotten us\n\nto where we are today with the Supreme Court\n\nis Congress has mostly stopped pulling those levers.\n\nAnd so when we talk about problems\n\nwith the current Supreme Court,\n\nwhen we talk about opportunities\n\nfor reform of the current Supreme Court,\n\nI like to start with the accountability question.\n\nHow can Congress impose more accountability on the justices\n\nwithout interfering with judicial independence?\n\nMaybe part of that starts\n\nwith an inspector general within the judicial branch,\n\nsomeone who could supervise\n\nwhether the justices are complying with the relevant ethics\n\nand financial disclosure rules.\n\nMaybe it starts with getting back into the norm\n\nof having the justices testify before Congress,\n\nsomething that used to happen with somewhat more regularity.\n\nWhatever you think the specific answer is though,\n\nI think a big part of how we've gotten to where we are today\n\nwith the Supreme Court is we have a court that is not\n\nand does not think it ought to be accountable\n\nto the other branches the way that was true\n\nfor most of American history.\n\nWell, I think that's it.\n\nI've tried to answer all your questions.\n\nHope you've liked the answers.\n\nThanks for joining us.

We're ready.\n\nFirst question.\n\nWhen did F1 first start?\n\n1950, at Silverstone. 1950.\n\nIt was called the Grand Prix de Europe,\n\nbecause, I don't know, the FIA was French\n\nI think at the time.\n\nAh, yeah, true.\n\nThere were the FIA back then?\n\nOkay.\n\nWhy do F1 drivers train their neck?\n\nBecause we are strapped down\n\nwith our whole body except the neck.\n\nSo our head is the only thing that can really move.\n\nHonestly, nothing beats just driving.\n\nI don't train the neck.\n\nYou don't do it at all, do you?\n\nWhat, off season?\n\nNever.\n\nThen how do you do the first test?\n\nI arrive to a first test.\n\nI die one day and.\n\nThen you're fine.\n\nReally?\n\nIt's the endurance which is hard to reproduce, basically.\n\nSo, we can get the strength in the gym,\n\nbut you can't hold, you know, your neck for an hour.\n\nDo some F1 tracks have more physical impact\n\non you than others?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nYes.\n\nWell, the most one, Singapore,\n\nI think we agree, Singapore is.\n\nYeah. Qatar.\n\nQatar 23.\n\nThere's two tracks.\n\nQatar and Singapore.\n\nI think the sun board is underrated.\n\nHow much time is an F1 race?\n\nThat's such an easy question.\n\nIt's one hour 40.\n\nBut depends on which race.\n\nExactly.\n\nOkay, Monaco is 1 50.\n\nFour days long, the race.\n\nWhy do I find drivers drive zig-zag?\n\nTo heat. To warm up the tires.\n\nThe tires up.\n\nDrive zig-zig.\n\n[driver laughs]\n\nPutting energy on your tires, turning right.\n\nYou can imagine in a straight line\n\nyou don't got any energy on the sides of the tires.\n\nSo when you do zig-zags, you're loading,\n\nyou're, you're, you're,\n\nyou're stretching the sides of the tires.\n\nWhy does a tire have more grip, Alex?\n\nWhen it's warm.\n\nAnd they're round and they're smooth.\n\n'Cause they are not smooth.\n\nAre F1 cars manual?\n\nKind of.\n\nYou respond to this.\n\nFor sure they're not automatic in terms of,\n\nwe need to drive them.\n\nWe don't clutch or anything to shift.\n\nIt's like your tiptronic car\n\nthat you can put in sport mode.\n\nWe are drivers.\n\nWe are Formula 1 drivers.\n\nThere's no H pattern there.\n\nClutch for first gear and then all up full throttle.\n\nCan F1 cars reverse?\n\nYes they can.\n\nIt's a bit more difficult than my Alfa Romeo road car.\n\nYes.\n\nYou can't see, that's the problem.\n\nThere's no reversing camera.\n\nThe mirrors are very hard to see as well.\n\nSee the problem is when you need to use reverse,\n\nyou're in panic mode because that means you've.\n\nDone something wrong. Done something wrong.\n\nSo you always are like trying to find reverse.\n\nAnd it's a simple way of finding reverse,\n\nbut it takes five, five seconds to find it more or less.\n\nBut it's precious time.\n\nWhy do F1 cars have the halo?\n\nTo protect our heads.

Yes.\n\nIt protects from car going,\n\nit can happen, a car.\n\nIt can happen.\n\nIt has happened.\n\nYeah, it has happened.\n\nA car going into your head like on your side\n\nand it's very, very resistant.\n\nI don't like this question.\n\nNo, you go read it, what is it?\n\nWhy is F1 better than NASCAR?\n\nI mean, no offense.\n\nI like NASCAR a lot. Me too.\n\nMe too.\n\nWe didn't say that.\n\nThat's, that's what you put in our mouths.\n\nYeah, I, I think it's just different.\n\nWe can't take as many curbs as NASCAR.\n\nI would love to take like the last chicane in Canada.\n\nImagine if we're in NASCAR.\n\nWell you make it a straight line.\n\nYeah.\n\nMy only reason why I would say F1 is better than NASCAR\n\nis because it's way faster.\n\nAnd faster, for me, the better.\n\nBut I respect NASCAR drivers and what they do\n\nand I think it's a great motor sport to watch also.\n\nCan F1 drivers see behind them?\n\nYes, we can.\n\nWe have two very small mirrors.\n\nThat vibrate a lot.\n\nThat vibrates a lot\n\nAnd it's vibrates so much that you see sometimes\n\nfive cars in the same spot.\n\nBut it's the same car.\n\nIt's the same car just doing this.\n\nWho is the Formula 1 movie about?\n\nRetired Formula 1 driver, Sonny Hayes,\n\ncomes back to an American team.\n\nBut he was never in F1.\n\nYeah, he was in F1. He was, he was, he was.\n\nIn the beginning.\n\nHad a big crash, yeah.\n\nHe had a massive shunt.\n\nOkay, spoiler.\n\nSo he comes back to Formula 1\n\nto help American team Apex GP\n\nto get to be successful in Formula 1.\n\nTry and hit the screen. Whoa.\n\nNearly killed someone.\n\nWhat g-force do F1 drivers experience?\n\nDepends if you crash or not.\n\nIt can be like 50 if you have a big shunt.\n\nA normal race, I guess like five,\n\nmaybe six in breaking.\n\nSustained. Peak.\n\nYeah. Peak.\n\nBecause peak is six in breaking and the sustained five in.\n\nCorners.\n\nTurn three in Barcelona, maybe.\n\nMaybe six for McLaren.\n\nBut biggest crash I've had is 46 G.\n\nAny big crashes?\n\nNever had one. The Miami one.\n\nThat hurt.\n\nI had it the year before.\n\nIn the concrete, no?\n\nI peed red the following day.\n\nOh. That's a nice.\n\nWow. That's disgusting.\n\nYeah, sorry guys.\n\nI was like, is that what he said or, wow.\n\nYeah, yeah. Why?\n\nIt was a high impact, yeah I don't know.\n\nDo F1 drivers ever think about anything other\n\nthan the race during the race?\n\nYes, we definitely do.\n\nIf it's a very boring race.\n\nThe party afterwards.\n\nHow slow can I go?\n\nI did a challenge in Monaco to try and do a full lap\n\nwithout doing full throttle.\n\nOh my god.\n\nAnd I managed it.\n\nI didn't lose any time actually.\n\nLots of focus.\n\n[drivers laugh]\n\nReaction time.\n\nF1 drivers don't fight.\n\nDo F1 drivers drive with both feet?\n\nIt's right foot break.\n\nYes.\n\nNo you don't actually, right foot break.\n\nNo.\n\nI break right foot.\n\nNo, he's kidding.\n\nYou almost believe me.\n\nNo, we, we, we drive with both feet.\n\nSo right foot is the throttle, left the break,\n\nand the clutch is on the hands.\n\nSo it's just for first gear, when we pull out the garage\n\nor we do the race start,\n\notherwise we don't need to use the clutch.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhen does the F1 season start?\n\nLate February, start of March.\n\nWhat fuel do F1 cars use?\n\nI have no idea.\n\nPetrol?\n\nNo, it's 10% ethanol and the rest is the race fuel\n\nthat's our providers basically.\n\nBut it's like super 98, no equivalent.\n\nSuper 98. No it's a hundred.\n\nIt's gotta be more than 98. It's 110 octane.\n\nYeah. Really?\n\nSo the ethanol is 114 and then we have a bit less.\n\nI had no idea.\n\nWhat's are F1 drivers' favorite circuits?\n\nCan we all agree it's Suzuka?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nYeah, agree.\n\nSuzuka's pretty cool, yeah.\n\nCan we all agree the next one might be?\n\nMonaco.\n\nMonaco is up there.\n\nMonaco?\n\nOn the quarter lap?\n\nNo quarter lap, Alex.\n\nI like Austin.\n\nI love Austin.\n\nSuzuka narrow, I would say.\n\nYou feel like there's a chance to crash\n\nwhich gives you the adrenaline.\n\nNo the risk and reward, I would say.\n\nYeah, when you finish a lap\n\nand your heart rates like this,\n\nthat's a good track.\n\nAre F1 cars all the same?\n\nYes.\n\nCompletely the same.\n\nThey're close enough so we can compete,\n\nbut then they're all completely.\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nEvery team makes their own car.\n\nAnd we are currently in the year\n\nof the closest ever year in F1.\n\nI think all cars are within eight tenths of each other.\n\nEight tenths is that after a lap,\n\nI could do a lap in a Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull,\n\nand then I jump in another car and I go eight tenths slower.\n\nBetween first and last is.\n\nBetween first and last.\n\nYeah, is eight tenths\n\nQuite impressive.\n\nBut what people need to know is that\n\nbetween F1 drivers there's no more than two or three tenths.\n\nSo those eight tens are, is still quite a lot.\n\nWhich F1 car is the fastest?\n\nMcLaren is the fastest.\n\nEveryone agrees, right?\n\nYes.\n\nIt's quite close.\n\nThis year's McLaren to the 2020 Mercedes actually.\n\nWhy is Formula 1 called Formula 1?\n\nBecause it's about formula two and three and four.\n\nNo, I think the way a car is built is a formula.\n\nIt's number one formula.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nIt's a good point, yeah.\n\nSo it's a formula of things.\n\nAnd it's the first one.\n\nIt's the top one.\n\nIt's the number one.\n\nNumber one. Yeah.\n\nWhy are F1 tires smooth?\n\nI think they mean why are they sleek?\n\nI'm thinking of it literally like why they're not square.\n\n[drivers laugh]\n\nTo offer the highest level of grip available for the tire.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nIf you put your hand like that,\n\nit's not gonna grip much.\n\nIf you put it like this, it grips more.\n\n[driver laughs]\n\nWhat F1 drivers are in the F1 movie?\n\nYou. All of us.\n\nI'm not in the movie.\n\nYes, you are in the title at the end.\n\nAt the title, in the credits?\n\nI've seen you in the credits.\n\nCarlos is clearly the one featured the most.\n\nHe has, he has a whole sentence.\n\nYeah, he does. Yeah.\n\nDude. It's a great scene.\n\nSpoiler alert.\n\nThose are all the questions.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n[upbeat music]", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"right\", \"questions\", \"f1\", \"dont\", \"answer\", \"googled\", \"theyre\", \"car\", \"drivers\", \"thats\", \"think\", \"formula\", \"cars\"]", "content_hash": "b1857a8db28eccc0ffd814c3b75828a3949ad609dd3845047d735079a5adad12", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:54:13.615191+00:00"}

Here are a few more products that are still available which we liked but didn't love as much as the ones above.\n\nThe Saatva Contour5 for $2,999: The Contour5 is a new offering from Saatva, replacing the popular Loom & Leaf in the company's lineup. Like other Saatva mattresses, but unlike most others on this list, it is not roll-packed and comes delivered on a moving truck. The Contour5 has two firmness options and updated cooling tech that uses airflow channels in its gel foam layer, which is thinner than its predecessor, meaning it retains less heat. In my two weeks of testing, I found the Contour 5 was very good at remaining cool through summer nights, which is extra impressive given that it uses very dense 5-pound-weight memory foam. The Contour5 is soft enough for side sleeping without feeling like a saggy hammock and has excellent build quality, which is impressive for an all-foam mattress without springs. I prefer a hybrid with microcoils, but Saatva is popular for a reason, and as all-foam mattresses go, it has a true luxury feel. —Martin Cizmar. $1,899 to $3,599\n\nThe Big Fig Classic for $1,899: The Big Fig is designed for larger body frames. Being a bit overweight myself, I was eager to see how well this mattress, which is advertised as comfortably handling 550 pounds per sleeper, performed. It is a well-built mattress with an effective gel cooling layer; however, the aggressive edge support created a hammock-like feel despite the sturdy springs and three layers of high-density foam in the middle of the mattress. This was true both on my back and on my side. Others may appreciate the effect of sinking a bit into the center of the bed more than I do. —Martin Cizmar. $1,499 to $2,699\n\nThe Boring Hybrid Mattress for $799: Boring Mattress is a new company founded by two alums from Tuft & Needle. Simplicity is the company's selling point. There is just one option: the Boring Hybrid Mattress. (You are allowed to pick a size.) This 10-inch hybrid has four layers of both foam and springs. I’m very sensitive to joint pain, and certain beds tend to make it worse, which is why pressure relief is super important for me. Having slept on a variety of different mattresses throughout the years, I was doubtful that this one would work. But I’ve slept on the hybrid mattress for months now and have yet to feel any pain at all. It strikes an excellent balance between firmness and support that my very particular self hasn’t been able to find with other options on the market. It’s worth noting, however, that its layers come equipped with an open-cell design that’s designed to move heat from your body while sleeping. I’m usually cold, so this feature isn’t that important to me. But on nights when I’ve cranked the heat up in my room and woken up sweating a bit, I can’t say it worked all that well for me. This isn’t a deal breaker, but I wouldn’t buy it solely for that. —Brenda Stolyar. $599 to $999\n\nCasper The One for $799: Casper was a leader in the first wave of bed-in-a-box makers in 2014. The company has changed ownership and design a few times over the past decade but last year's launch of The One finds the company keeping pace with competitors. This is an all-foam mattress that stands 11 inches tall. Because it's all foam, it’s on the light side, with a queen weighing an easily movable 66 pounds. One of the main issues with all-foam beds is that they get too hot, but Casper’s The One uses an open-cell foam layer called Breathe Flex Foam on the top, which makes it both pleasantly squishy and breathable. Two more layers of foam add up to a medium-firm feel, with the middle layer designed to cradle your hips, and the base layer designed to provide support. —Martin Cizmar. $749 to $1,698\n\nThe Winkbed for $1,499: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu slept on the luxury firm version of the WinkBed for almost two years and he was quite happy in that time. His favorite perk? The edge support is fantastic, so his partner never wakes when he slips into bed late at night. The plush pillowtop also adds a luxe, hotel-like feel to a relatively firm bed. —Martin Cizmar. $1,149 to $2,049\n\nS&S Organic for $1,000: I wouldn't expect this to feel silky-soft, but the latex is something even more supportive for sleep. I love how responsive (read: bouncy) this bed is, especially as someone who tosses and turns often. It's able to move with me so I never feel unsupported, or overheated for that matter. Latex and coils are breathable, as are the organic cotton cover and wool fire barrier are. —Julia Forbes. $800 to $1,300\n\nNest Bedding Quail for $1,299: When it comes to all-foam mattresses from classic bed-in-a-box brands, I prefer the Casper above, but the Quail by Nest is a nice option if you want an all-foam bed that's a little firmer and you're willing to pay a little more. My biggest issue with the Nest was that despite its claimed cooling system—the foam is infused with minerals and designed with an airflow layer—I did sleep a little hot on it during my week of testing. —Martin Cizmar. $849 to $1,499\n\nCourtesy of Helix Sleep\n\nHelix Sunset Elite for $3,748: Our top pick, Helix, also has an Elite collection that consists of seven mattresses along a spectrum of softness. At 16 inches high, this is \"the tallest mattress on the internet,\" and comes shipped in two separate boxes, each heavy enough to max out FedEx requirements. The firmness is dictated by the foam density of the upper layer, which zips into a larger support system. This makes the mattress adjustable if you end up regretting your order. The bottom section has two separate layers of microcoils. I spent a month sleeping on the softest model from the Elite line, dubbed the Sunset, and appreciated the deep cradling effect. Helix offers a 100-day trial period on all of its mattresses. —Martin Cizmar. $2,499 to $4,499\n\nDreamCloud Hybrid for $1,698: Don't be turned off by that price just yet. This is one mattress that my husband begged me to keep, because the support and pressure relief set the bar so high. It's been one of the most consistently performing mattresses I've tested over the years. And that seemingly high price? DreamCloud runs sales often, so expect to slash that in half. —Julia Forbes. $1,148 to $2,562\n\nWayfair Sleep 14-Inch Plush Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress for $410: This plush mattress has a top layer of cooling gel that conforms to your body for comfort and has classic pocket coils below for structure and support, with layers of memory foams with varying thickness surrounding the coils for extra support (the coils and memory foam mixture helps with low motion transfer, too). The top knit cover and sides help with breathability and the overall cooling effect. The mattress is also compatible with an adjustable bed base, has solid edge support, is CertiPUR-US and Oeko-Tex Certified (ensuring no harmful toxins), and has a 10-year warranty. This bed is super comfy if you like a more plush mattress. —Molly Higgins. $400 to $700\n\nMattresses to Avoid\n\nThere are some models you should avoid. Many of these beds are extremely affordable, and if you aren't picky, they may feel fine. In other cases, the mattress is decent but the price is not.\n\nTempur-Pedic Tempur-Adapt for $2,199: Tempur-Pedic is one of the country's best-known and loved mattress brands, but two separate WIRED reviewers (Martin Cizmar and Nena Farrell) have both disliked different mattresses from the company over the past two years. Nena found the Tempur-Adapt totally lacking in support, and felt like she was sinking into a void when she lay on it. Her spine and muscles both ached after sleeping on it so she gave it to her sister who also hated it, describing it as like sleeping on a leaky air mattress. —Martin Cizmar. $1,699 to $3,398\n\nMagniflex Magnistretch 12 for $4,399: This mattress is Italian-made and advertises itself as stretching the spine. It’s endorsed by retired Italian soccer player Giorgio Chiellini and current pro basketballer Stefano Tonut, who plays for the Italian equivalent of the Boston Celtics. Well, the Magniflex definitely does something to the spine, though I found it very unwelcome. (It's worth noting that I am not the same Martin Cizmar who played a little pro soccer in Slovakia.) I lasted only two nights on the Magnistretch before crying uncle and limping over to my next tester. The morning-after sensation was as if I'd slept on a hammock made of chainlink fence, and my lower back was left feeling weak and creaky—very possibly it was stretched, and if so, it turns out I don't like having my back stretched. —Martin Cizmar. $3,699 to $5,299\n\nSleep Number Climate360 Smart Bed for $10,249: This bed can be temperature-controlled, which is amazing. The adjustable base means you can be comfortable when watching TV, reading, or sleeping. Unfortunately, the price tag has too many digits, and sleep experts recommend avoiding electronic usage before bed—advice the Sleep IQ app defies. Did we mention it costs as much as a used Buick and the weight is not far behind? —Martin Cizmar. $10,249 to $14,449\n\nAmazon Basics mattress for $170 (Twin): This one is made of cheap foam that isn't dense enough, causing too much sinkage. —Martin Cizmar. $170 to $436\n\nParachute Eco Comfort Mattress for $2,650: This mattress just doesn't live up to its extravagant price. The model we tested didn't have enough proper padding above its coils. —Martin Cizmar. $1,550 to $2,850\n\nFrequently Asked Questions How We Test Mattresses AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED has tested mattresses since 2019. The very first version of our buying guide was made by sourcing two dozen beds and having our staff lay on them in a conference room to pick a favorite. But anyone who has bought a few beds in person from a mattress store can tell you the mattress you prefer when lounging in a well-lit store at 4 pm may not be the mattress you want while trying to get a few last winks at 4 am. We subsequently learned that there is no substitute for actually sleeping on tester mattresses in our own homes. We don't rely on surveys of random shoppers or labs with falling bowling balls to make our recommendations. We bring each bed into our homes for at least seven nights of real-life testing. Only after a week of good, restful sleep—as our lead reviewer I have personally tested 40-plus beds in the past two years—will we recommend a product. Everything we test gets at least a few nights to make a positive impression, but when we decide we hate a product we will stop short of testing it for seven nights and get ourselves some better sleep. How Firm or Soft Should Your Mattress Be? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The biggest decision in every mattress purchase is how firm to go. Generally, heavier people and back sleepers or stomach sleepers will do better with firmer beds, while lighter people and side sleepers enjoy softer. Temperature is also an issue: Softer mattresses sleep warmer since your body is sinking into a layer of fabric and foam. Keep in mind that all mattresses have a break-in period, and the way the mattress feels on your first night won't be how it feels after a week or two. It's also worth considering that if you buy a firmer mattress and want to soften it up, a mattress topper is a great option—we've got a full guide to the best—but it's much harder to make a soft mattress firmer. Should You Wait for a Sale? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Mattresses go on sale often—Presidents’ Day has somehow become the biggest sale day of the year, as famously mentioned on Nate Bargatze's Saturday Night Live skit. Labor Day and Memorial Day also somehow become mattress sale holidays. Additionally, online mattresses are often advertised as being on sale perennially. There's a strong chance you can save hundreds of dollars by waiting for the next big sale event. WIRED covers all of these sales and carefully tracks prices throughout the year so we can alert you to the best actual deals as opposed to “sales” that are not much different than the normal asking price. Can You Set Up a Bed-in-a-Box by Yourself? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Take it from someone who has dealt with dozens over the past year: Bed-in-a-box mattresses delivered by FedEx are relatively easy to deal with. Most of these mattresses are delivered vacuum-sealed and rolled up. Some are pretty heavy—up to 150 pounds—and if you're ordering one of those, be sure someone is there to help you. After you unroll your bed-in-a-box mattress and cut the vacuum bag open, it'll immediately begin to inflate, so unbox it on your bed frame or near it. We have a helpful guide on how to set up the mattress you bought online with more tips. The mattresses are usually ready to go in a few hours, but most manufacturers recommend giving them two days to reach their normal state. What if You Don't Like the Mattress You Bought Online? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Most of the picks we've tested and recommend have at least a 100-night testing period and a 10-year warranty. Before you buy, be sure to look at the company's policy as you may be on the hook for a nominal return fee. Set yourself a reminder a few days before the return deadline to make a final assessment. Should You Buy a Hybrid or an All-Foam? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Old school mattresses were made of springs with thin layers of foam and cloth and usually sat on a box spring. Bed-in-a-box mattresses, on the other hand, are either foam or hybrids that layer foam with built-in springs. (I have never tested one that required a box spring.) We tend to recommend hybrids because they are more stable and supportive, and they usually stay cooler because the springs leave room for airflow. Hybrids are often slightly pricier. Foam mattresses tend to be softer, lighter, and cheaper. What Size Mattress Should You Buy? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The prices in our guide are based on the queen size, which is the most popular size in the US. But everything we've included comes in various standard sizes, usually standard twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king. You'll want to buy based on the size of your bed frame. Are Online Mattresses Safe? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Mattresses sold in the US are subject to consumer protection rules on things like flammability and have requirements for tags that show when and where they were made (you remember the verbiage that says you can't remove tags under penalty of law, which has inspired generations of comedians). Any mattress you buy online should be safe, but it's always better to do business with reputable companies. How does WIRED acquire the mattresses to test? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron There are a couple of ways we get mattresses into our testing queue. Often brands reach out to introduce themselves. Sometimes we see a mattress has been given a great review by a competitor and we want to test for ourselves. All of the beds on the current vesion of this story were provided as free samples by each of the brands you see here, with the exception of Wayfair and Amazon Basics which WIRED purchased. What does WIRED do with the mattresses after testing them? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED's Reviews team is always testing new mattresses, cycling through about 50 in a year. We recently hired a dedicated sleep writer, Julia Forbes, to help keep pace with testing needs. The majority of beds are considered “samples” and are sent to us for free by companies hoping to be given a good review. We don't keep them though. We are happy to send them back. Mattress companies cannot resell used mattresses and shipping is expensive, so this is rarely the path them choose. Once testing is through and all data has been recorded, our team passes them on to the community without getting any personal benefit. Commerce director Martin Cizmar has given away dozens of mattresses on Facebook Mareketplace—if you're in Kansas City and need a free lightly used mattress keep your eyes peeled. We also purchase (and expense) some mattresses we want to test. We won't say we like something we don't based on the commission rate. What should you look for when buying a mattress? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron This may seem like a vague question, but it's actually requiring you to do some introspection. You'll need to honestly ask yourself about your body type, sleeping position(s) of choice, the materials you want, and other checklist items. From there, this will help you hone in on the bed that best fits you—with expert advice from our team along the way, of course. What are mattress certifications? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We actually have a whole article outlining the various certifications associated with different mattress materials. In a nutshell though, these are the baseline qualifications ensured by a third-party evaluation so that there is no sway. Qualifications ensure things like memory foam don't contain chemicals that could harm you, or that questionable substances aren't present in a finished mattress.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

You can customize all the colors and components of this folding electric bike, and it has a surprisingly powerful motor for its size. The Brompton above is more widely available and easier to use, but I love this little bike a lot.\n\nRadio Flyer Via Pro for $2,899: Editor Julian Chokkattu could not have had a better experience than this easy-to-use and easy-to-assemble class 2 electric cargo bike. For more info, check out our guide to the Best Electric Cargo Bikes.\n\nAventon Level 3 for $1,899: The Aventon Level 3 is an easy-to-ride ebike that features a clean, step-through design and every feature you could want in a standard-size ebike for riding around town. There are built-in fenders and lights, and a big color display shows you how much of the up to 70 miles of advertised range you have remaining. I have ridden it up to about 25 miles at a time with my heavy 6'2\" frame, easily ending my rides with 20 percent of battery left. The frame feels comfortable and sturdy, thanks to a double-walled construction and improved Shimano gears and brakes. The front suspension fork and semi-hidden suspension seat post add to comfort relative to other bikes I’ve tested in this price range, and I like that the Aventon app lets you set up things like remote locking and geofencing, so you can keep an eye on your expensive bike from afar. The built-in turn signals, which use the bike’s rear lights, are another bonus when riding in cities at night. —Parker Hall\n\nTenways CGO800S for $1,999: This is a budget step-through city ebike. It boasts up to 50 miles of battery life, and I got more than 30. The torque sensor is smooth and responsive to pedaling at various speeds. However, there's no throttle, and because this bike is meant to fit riders of a huge range of sizes (they say 5'1'' to 6'3''), the frame was not as comfortable to pedal for me (5'11\") as some large-size bikes. —Martin Cizmar\n\nEngwe LE20 for $1,899: The selling point of this bike is that for $1,500, you get a cargo bike with room for a massive payload and two high-capacity batteries, which is theoretically able to traverse 211 miles while carrying a 165-pound rider. The batteries only carried me about 80 miles on a single charge (I weigh a lot more and didn't pedal as much as I could have) during three days of testing on America's longest rail-to-trail project, but still, that's a wow stat. This is the roughest assembly job I've had with a DTC ebike, and I ultimately did take it into a shop where the owner congratulated me on the wise decision to not ride it as-is. With weight pushing 100 pounds, it's not easy to load up for travel—you're not putting this thing on a rack. It carries cargo with ease, and with the $170 fast-charger upgrade, you can cover serious mileage in a day. —Martin Cizmar\n\nAventon Ramblas for $2,599: Aventon made a mountain bike! It's a lot of bike for an affordable price, but just a little too heavy to take out for its intended use case. It makes a nice, rugged commuter, however.\n\nLinus eDutchi for $1,799: Need a comfy cruiser? The Linus eDutchi is a comfy class 1 ebike with beautiful colors and loads of proprietary accessories.\n\nElectra Loft Go! Photograph: Electra\n\nElectra Loft Go! for $1,200: I also love the Electra Loft Go! (7/10, WIRED Recommends), which is another comfy sit-up beach cruiser, but the Priority has a slightly more powerful motor for the same price.\n\nXtracycle Estoker for $4,499: This is probably the bike that I see most often in my Portland, Oregon, neighborhood. It has a durable, sturdy Chromoly steel frame and larger 24-inch wheels, along with a Shimano mid-drive motor that makes it perfect for more grueling conditions. Unfortunately, you do have to be over 5'6\" (which I am not) to ride it.\n\nGazelle Eclipse for $6,399: If you want to know just how great the Bosch system can be, the Eclipse (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the more expensive version of the Radster Road above. It has a nicer shifter, a smarter motor—even the paint job is nicer. It's just much more expensive.\n\nHeybike Tyson for $1,399: You get a lot of stuff for not very much money with the Tyson (6/10, WIRED Review), a fat-tire, folding ebike that includes suspension, blinkers, a throttle, and one of the most obnoxious horns I've ever heard. The components are not super-high-quality, but it's an affordable, comfortable way to dip your toes into ebike waters.\n\nThe Gocycle G4I+ for $5,999: Gocycle's high-end, fast-folding luxury bikes are designed by a former McLaren engineer. This quieter, lighter iteration has better torque, a new carbon-fiber front fork, and an even more painful price.\n\nThe Bunch Original Electric Cargo Bike for $6,499: I didn't care for the Bunch (5/10, WIRED Review), but my family did. It's a standard, if slightly expensive, box bike as you might see in Europe. It'll work well if you live in a flat area and don't have to go very fast.\n\nBikes We Dislike\n\nPass on the left.\n\nThe Retrospec Jax Rev Photograph: Retrospec\n\nThe Retrospec Jax Rev for $1,000: We wanted to love this sleek, stylish folding bike, but we couldn't help worrying about its durability.\n\nNiu Electric Bike BQi-C3 Pro for $1.699: Commerce director Martin Cizmar tested this bike and had a litany of complaints. The riding position is too aggressive, and the bike frame doesn't fit common components like a water bottle and his pannier. The disc brakes weren't suited to stopping it from 28 mph.\n\nFAQs How Does WIRED Procure Ebikes? Bike companies reach out to me, and I request testers in my size. Once I have finished testing, I either return the bikes to the manufacturer, the shop that assembled them, or donate them to nonprofit organizations. How Do You Secure an Ebike? Many ebikes have removable batteries, displays, or built-in wheel locks that make securing your bike much easier. Other bikes, like the Specialized Turbo Vado SL 2, are also compatible with Apple Find My. Check out our Best Ebike Locks guide for more options. Should I Build My Own Bike? Many affordable bikes now come direct-to-consumer—meaning that they are pre-tuned or partially assembled in a box. As Peter Flax recently noted in Bicycling magazine, these bikes do not get nearly the testing or vetting that bikes from a bigger manufacturer get. Unless you're not riding much or for many miles, or are experienced with modifying your own bike, I recommend working with an established manufacturer that has a dealer network. What Terrain Do You Live On? If you live in a flat area, you're probably fine with a 250-watt motor, which is the European speed standard. However, if you live near hills or haul a lot of stuff, you might want to consider a 500-watt or 750-watt motor and a few extras, like hydraulic disc brakes, which will help prevent you from skidding into traffic. How Do I Prevent Bike Fires? The idea of your garage suddenly setting alight is terrifying, but don't worry—the batteries that manufacturers use today are much safer than those of yore. We only write about bikes that have been certified safe by a third-party organization. Also, exercise a bit of common sense. Do not leave your bike battery charging overnight in a boiling hot garage. Don't use aftermarket accessories to charge your bike. And don't plug in a battery that has deformed or smells weird, or try to turn on a bike with a cracked display or computer. Follow Some Basic Safety Tips Not sure where to start? The biking advocacy group PeopleForBikes has a safety education program, E-Bike Smart, which it created in collaboration with the League of American Bicyclists and Bicycle Colorado. Do not let your children ride your bike unsupervised. An 80-pound child should not be piloting a 65-pound bike, even if the motor makes it possible for them to do so. And always wear a helmet, but you already know that. Right? How We Test AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Over the past few years, WIRED's Reviews team has tried almost every kind of electric bike, from the best heavy-duty cargo bikes to high-end mountain bikes. We review upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we also evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components. It Costs What Now? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Whenever I talk to anyone about a possible ebike purchase, the biggest deterrent is usually the price. If this is you, check out our guide to the Best Cheap Ebikes. But I do want to say here that these are vehicles, not toys. When I'm carrying my kids to school or flying down a hill at 25 mph, I want the safest possible ride, and I think you should too. Reasonable auto financing options are the only reason a $2,000 electric bike can feel prohibitively expensive while a $6,000 beater gas-powered car has easy monthly payments. Many states now feature incentive programs that offer rebates or tax credits for ebike purchases. Some bike manufacturers and retailers offer financing through companies like Affirm or PayPal. Your bank might cover ebikes under its vehicle loan program, and I also recommend looking at eBay locally, Craigslist, or local Facebook groups. You probably have more options than you think. Ebike Classifications and Rules AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Before you buy your electric bike, make sure you can actually use it! Many cities and states have laws regulating when and where you can ride an ebike. Check out our guide on the three classes of ebikes. At least 22 states now use this three-class system, and they may restrict when and where different classes of ebikes are used, depending on whether they have a throttle or can assist above 20 mph. Cities may also have laws about whether mountain ebikes are allowed on single-track trails. If your state classifies ebikes under the same laws governing motorcycles and mopeds, you may need a license to ride one.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

{"url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-soundbars/", "title": "13 Best Soundbars We’ve Tested and Reviewed (2025): Sonos, Sony, Bose", "authors": "[\"Parker Hall\", \"Ryan Waniata\", \"Adrienne So\", \"Brenda Stolyar\", \"Christopher Null\", \"Simon Hill\", \"Martin Cizmar\", \"Luke Larsen\"]", "published": "2018-10-01T12:00:00+00:00", "text": "Honorable Mentions\n\nPhotograph: Parker Hall\n\nThere are a lot of great soundbars out there, and we don’t have room to feature them all. Here are some others you might want to consider.\n\nLG's S95TR for $1,000-1,500: LG's 9.1.5-channel soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) doesn't perform as well as Samsung's flagship Q990 series, but it could be a better choice for those with newer LG TVs like the C4, which can connect wirelessly and use its speakers in tandem with the bar for more immersion. It also supports gaming features like 120-Hz pass-through, but only includes one spare input.\n\nSony Bravia Theater 9 for $1,400: Sony’s follow-up to the potent HT-A7000 flagship soundbar regresses in some key ways. There are fewer inputs (no more analog), a more mundane fabric-wrapped design, and minimal sound settings. The Theater 9's leaner frame equates to a less meaty and immersive soundstage, but this is still a Sony flagship soundbar, which means great musicality, superb detail, and advanced spatial imaging for 3D audio. Premium features like an HDMI 2.1 input for connecting modern game consoles and advanced integration with newer Sony TVs sweeten the deal, but at $1,400, it’s a pricey proposition.\n\nVizio 2.1 Soundbar (SV210M) for $170: Vizio’s curvy little combo brings enticing value, with solid sound quality and some cinematic punch from the teensiest subwoofer you’ll ever see. There’s no optical input or remote included, but the Vizio app makes adjusting settings or swapping to Bluetooth simple enough. The main drawback is that dialog sometimes (but not always) gets lost, reducing the main draw of a cheap soundbar. That said, good musical chops and features like DTS Virtual X expansion make it worth considering on sale.\n\nSamsung HW-Q800C for $598: If Samsung's HW-Q990C everything bar is too rich for your blood, the two-piece HW-Q800C (8/10, WIRED Recommends) could be a good compromise. This bar offers a similar sound signature as Samsung's flagship bars and many of the same features, packed into a smaller bar-and-subwoofer combo for a notable discount–especially since it's now almost always on sale.\n\nSennheiser Ambeo Mini for $700: This pint-sized luxury bar is great for those with money to burn in very small spaces. Sennheiser's built-in Ambeo virtualization technology brilliantly throws sound all around you for exhilarating TV shows and movies, and offers advanced features like support for Google Assistant and Alexa.\n\nSony HT-X8500 for $300: Sony's HT-X8500 is getting harder to find, but it's still one of our favorite options for those after a single bar with solid bass response and expansive sound, including decent Dolby Atmos virtualization. While it's pricier than our top bar, it's a great alternative for those after a bit more, and worth considering while it's still available.\n\nSennheiser Ambeo Plus for $1,200: Given the price and the physical dimensions of the soundbar—which doesn't even include a subwoofer—the Ambeo Plus might look like a poor deal. But thanks to its 400 watts of power and its nine carefully developed and even more carefully positioned drivers, this Sennheiser is capable of big, enveloping sound with a strong suggestion of the sonic height that Dolby Atmos soundtracks thrive on. By way of an encore, it turns out to be a hugely capable wireless speaker when you want to listen to some music, too. —Simon Lucas\n\nThe Polk React for $269: This soundbar works if you want to get surround sound eventually but don’t have the cash right now. The Alexa-enabled soundbar is fine on its own, with surround speakers and subwoofers available from Polk if you want to upgrade.\n\nHow to Connect Your Soundbar AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We’ve included a list of available connectivity options next to every soundbar on our list. Most soundbars will connect to your TV via optical or HDMI cables, though the optical input is starting to go away for newer models, including even pricey flagship options. In most cases, HMDI is the preferable connection anyway. If your TV and soundbar both have an HDMI ARC/eARC port (the cable port looks like regular HDMI, but it’s labeled ARC or eARC), connect it that way. It will allow you to use the volume buttons on your TV remote to control the soundbar’s volume. Also, make sure CEC is enabled. Use an optical cable only if HDMI isn’t available, as HDMI is also necessary for Dolby Atmos and other 3D audio formats. Finally, check your TV audio menus to make sure your TV’s internal speakers are set to off (so you don’t get any weird audio fluttering) and find the best spots to place your speakers and sub. Why You Need a Soundbar AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have yet to test a new TV that didn’t sound better with an audio accessory. That’s mostly due to the way televisions are designed. Great-sounding speakers are bulky, and as TVs have gotten thinner with shrinking bezels and sleeker designs, manufacturers are having a harder time building good speakers into them. You can spend as little as $100 to $150 on a new soundbar, and it’s essential to getting the most out of your TV experience. Our list of the best soundbars we’ve tested includes soundbars sold on their own and models that come bundled with a subwoofer and surround speakers at a wide variety of price points. Are Soundbars as Good as Speakers? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Stumble onto any A/V or home theater subreddit or forum and you’ll see a mob of people claiming even the idea of a soundbar matching up to a pair of speakers is heresy. The truth, as far as we’re concerned, is that it all depends on your individual wants and needs. If you’re looking for the most musical bang for your buck, especially when it comes to hi-res audio and vinyl record collections, a great pair of bookshelf speakers is likely your best value option. Even if you’re not keen on shopping for an amp and running speaker wires, our best bookshelf speakers guide offers plenty of powered/active pairs that include all the inputs and amplification built-in, like a soundbar system for audiophiles. That may not be the best option for everybody, though. If you’re just after something cheap and simple to soup up your TV sound, or conversely, a convenient way to explore exciting audio formats like surround sound and Dolby Atmos, a soundbar could be the perfect choice. Soundbars are affordable and hassle-free solutions, many of which offer sound and features that may match your needs better than a pair of speakers or a traditional home theater setup. We take no sides here, we just love good sound and great features. For many, a soundbar is the best way to get there. Do You Need a Subwoofer? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron This is a question only you can answer, but there are a few points to consider before making a call, starting with your living space. If you live in a smaller apartment or multiplex, a subwoofer may not be the best choice due to both its size and its likelihood of arousing noise complaints. Larger modern soundbars have gotten increasingly good at reproducing convincing bass from a single bar, often utilizing multiple speakers in concert to bring more punch to lower frequencies without causing lots of boom and bombast. If you're less concerned about close quarters and looking for more cinematic punch, you should highly consider a soundbar with a subwoofer. Physics can only be stretched so far, and no multi-speaker system we’ve heard can match the punch and potency of a dedicated large driver and acoustic cabinet. Even many affordable soundbar models include a subwoofer. If you want full-throttle sound, we suggest considering going all in for a subwoofer, or at the very least a bar that allows you to add one later.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

{"url": "https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-tvs/", "title": "The Best TVs We’ve Reviewed from Sony, Samsung, LG, and More", "authors": "[\"Ryan Waniata\", \"Parker Hall\", \"Luke Larsen\", \"Daniel Thorp-Lancaster\", \"Julian Chokkattu\", \"Simon Hill\", \"Christopher Null\", \"Scott Gilbertson\"]", "published": "2018-12-02T13:00:00+00:00", "text": "Honorable Mentions\n\nThere are so many good TVs available, we can't add them all to our top list. Here are some great options that either missed the cut or got knocked off our top list by their replacements.\n\nHisense U8QG: The U8QG (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great buy at its lowest price (around $1,000 for a 65-inch model) and a solid pick above that price, especially if you want eye-searing brightness above all else. I noticed some SDR color accuracy issues (some images looked way too red) and found it difficult to keep it from wildly over-brightening some content. Thankfully, you can always turn it down, and its nuclear power plant is paired with excellent black levels, deep contrast, and plenty of features. I actually prefer last year's similarly punchy U8N (8/10, WIRED Recommends), but it's getting harder to find in stock.\n\nTCL QM7K (2025): I’ve had a love/hate relationship with the QM7K. Part of TCL's new Precise Dimming series, its opulent black levels and contrast reach toward OLED heights, matched by good brightness for some spectacular moments. The problem? My review model’s colors were off-kilter, with an odd green tint in select black and grayscale content. Thankfully, I confirmed that TCL's latest firmware update fixed the issue. The TV's picture processing and colors still don't catch premium TVs, and this is the second year in a row I've found a troubling performance issue with the QM7. You shouldn't buy it at full price, but if you can get the 65-inch model for $1,000 or less, it's an enticing choice.\n\nHisense U7N: If you’re after a TV at similar pricing to the QM6K but with some extra eye tingle, last year's Hisense U7N (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a serious brightness boost over our top pick and still ranks among our favorite options for your money. Its blooming control and screen uniformity aren’t as refined as the QM6K's but it’s got plenty of features, including great gaming credentials and a streamlined Google TV interface. It's still a great buy while stock lasts, especially at $700 or less.\n\nSony A95L: Sony finally replaced this sweet screen with the 2025 Bravia 8 II, which offers similarly incredible picture processing and upscaling alongside enhanced colors and higher HDR brightness. That shouldn't deter you from considering the A95L (9/10, WIRED Recommends) at a lower price. With fabulously immersive image quality and an intuitive Google TV interface, this is a premium package that's very enticing on a good sale.\n\nSony Bravia 7: The Bravia 7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a gorgeous display, offering brilliant brightness, naturalistic colors, and suave finesse in the subtle details. Its biggest knock is very poor off-axis viewing, which could be tough to swallow at its high list price. Otherwise, it's worth considering for fans of that Sony glow, especially since Sony seems to be discounting its best QLED TVs much more liberally than its OLED models.\n\nOther TVs We've Tested\n\nSamsung The Frame Pro: I put the Frame Pro through our full review process and came away both in limbo due to software issues and (so far) unimpressed with the performance. The matte screen looks slick when displaying art, especially if you purchase one of the add-on frames (a frame for the Frame?) from Samsung or Deco TV Frames. Picture performance was otherwise middling at best. It's much brighter than the traditional Frame and the colors pop, but its edge-lit mini LED system does not look good with dark 4K HDR content, even in the day. Moreover, I had trouble with its very sluggish operating system (which others have reported) and stuttering Blu-ray playback. We're awaiting a second model, which we hope relieves the software issues, but steer clear for now.\n\nTCL QM7: There's only one thing holding back 2024's beautifully balanced QM7 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed): a software glitch. During my review, I experienced an issue where adjusting SDR backlight levels affected HDR, which can lead to severe brightness limitations. While TCL fixed the issue in a firmware update for me, I never got confirmation on a broader OTA fix. Most folks probably won't have this issue, so the QM7 is still worth considering, but make sure and check it before throwing out the box.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.

Some won't touch anything that isn't air-cooled, convinced that everything went wrong when emissions and efficiency finally forced radiators into the car. Others love the \"Mezger\" engines; designed by engineer Hans Mezger, they trace their roots to the 1998 Le Mans-winning car, and no Porschephile can resist the added shine of a motorsports halo.\n\nI'm quite sure none of them will feel the same way about the powertrain in the new 911 Carrera GTS T-Hybrid (MSRP: $175,900), and I think that's a crying shame. Because not only is the car's technology rather cutting-edge—you won't find this stuff outside an F1 car—but having spent several days behind the wheel, I can report it might just be one of the best-driving, too.\n\nT-Hybrid\n\nThis is not just one of Porsche's existing flat-six engines with an electric motor bolted on; it's an all-new 3.6 L engine designed to comply with new European legislation that no longer lets automakers rich out a fuel mixture under high load to improve engine cooling. Instead, the engine has to maintain the same 14.7:1 stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio (also known as lambda = 1) across the entire operating range, thus allowing the car's catalytic converters to work most efficiently.\n\nJonathan Gitlin The 911 Carrera GTS T-Hybrid at dawn patrol.

Jonathan Gitlin\n\nBecause the car uses a hybrid powertrain, Porsche moved some of the ancillaries. There's no belt drive; the 400 V hybrid system powers the air conditioning electrically now via its 1.9 kWh lithium-ion battery, and the water pump is integrated into the engine block. That rearrangement means the horizontally opposed engine is now 4.3 inches (110 mm) lower than it was before, which meant Porsche could use that extra space in the engine bay to fit the power electronics, like the car's pulse inverters and DC-DC converters.\n\nAnd instead of tappets, Porsche has switched to using roller cam followers to control the engine's valves, as in motorsport. These solid cam followers don't need manual adjustment at service time, and they reduce friction losses compared to bucket tappets.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"tracks\", \"gts\", \"thybrid\", \"jonathan\", \"porsche\", \"carrera\", \"sure\", \"engines\", \"daily\", \"911\", \"best\", \"driver\", \"different\", \"porsches\", \"gitlin\", \"2025\", \"engine\", \"review\"]", "content_hash": "142ac07adb02ab6911395e4ad7ced793164ed20eac58c2c0dabeb1826700e4b8", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:54:35.655863+00:00"}

Ground crews then rolled the ship back to a nearby hangar for engine inspections, touchups to its heat shield, and a handful of other chores to ready it for liftoff.\n\nSpaceX has announced the launch is scheduled for no earlier than next Sunday, August 24, at 6:30 pm local time in Texas (23:30 UTC).\n\nLike all previous Starship launches, the huge 403-foot-tall (123-meter) rocket will take off from SpaceX's test site in Starbase, Texas, just north of the US-Mexico border. The rocket consists of a powerful booster stage named Super Heavy, with 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. Six Raptors power the upper stage, known simply as Starship.\n\nWith this flight, SpaceX officials hope to put several technical problems with the Starship program behind them. SpaceX is riding a streak of four disappointing Starship test flights from January through May, and and the explosion and destruction of another Starship vehicle during a ground test in June.\n\nThese setbacks followed a highly successful year for the world's largest rocket in 2024, when SpaceX flew Starship four times and achieved new objectives on each flight. These accomplishments included the first catch of a Super Heavy booster back at the launch pad, proving the company's novel concept for recovering and reusing the rocket's first stage.\n\nStarship's record so far in 2025 is another story. The rocket's inability to make it through an entire suborbital test flight has pushed back future program milestones, such as the challenging tasks of recovering and reusing the rocket's upper stage, and demonstrating the ability to refuel another rocket in orbit.

But in reality, most of today's cards top out around 900MB per second, roughly the amount of bandwidth available from a single PCI Express 3.0 lane.\n\nOriginally showcased in March, Biwin says its Mini SSD uses LGA packaging to squeeze NAND chips and an SSD controller onto the tiny cards, which are inserted into small metal trays and inserted into systems like a SIM card.

Users have made vociferous complaints about everything from the new model's more sterile tone to its supposed lack of creativity, increase in damaging confabulations, and more. The user revolt got so bad that OpenAI brought back the previous GPT-4o model as an option in an attempt to calm things down.\n\nTo see just how much the new model changed things, we decided to put both GPT-5 and GPT-4o through our own gauntlet of test prompts. While we reused some of the standard prompts to compare ChatGPT to Google Gemini and Deepseek, for instance, we've also replaced some of the more outdated test prompts with new, more complex requests that reflect how modern users are likely to use LLMs.\n\nThese eight prompts are obviously far from a rigorous evaluation of everything LLMs can do, and judging the responses obviously involves some level of subjectivity. Still, we think this set of prompts and responses gives a fun overview of the kinds of differences in style and substance you might find if you decide to use OpenAI's older model instead of its newest.\n\nDad jokes\n\nPrompt: Write 5 original dad jokes\n\nOpenAI / ArsTechnica Five dad jokes from GPT-5...

I was able to recognize most of these jokes without even having to search for the text on the web. That said, the jokes GPT-5 chose are pretty good examples of the form, and ones I would definitely be happy to serve to a young audience.\n\nGPT-4o, on the other hand, mixes a few unoriginal jokes (1, 3, and 5, though I liked the \"very literal dog\" addition on No. 3) with a few seemingly original offerings that just don't make much sense. Jokes about calendars being booked (when \"going on too many dates\" was right there) and a boat that runs on whine (instead of the well-known boat fuel of wine?!) have the shape of dad jokes, but whiff on their pun attempts.

Kennedy Jr. is reviving a long-defunct federal vaccine panel that anti-vaccine advocates, including Kennedy, have long sought and health experts fear will be used to dismantle evidence-based recommendations for life-saving childhood shots.\n\nThe panel is a task force outlined in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which is best known for setting up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The law states that the task force's goal is to \"promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions than those vaccines on the market on the effective date of this part and promote the refinement of such vaccines.\"\n\nThe federal government has multiple overlapping procedures and systems that evaluate, review, and continuously monitor the safety of childhood vaccines, which have gone through rigorous testing and are well-established to be safe. Further, the government does, in effect, promote improved vaccines by providing grants to academic and industry researchers to develop advanced shots. It also conducts its own vaccine research toward that goal. For instance, researchers at the National Institutes of Health were critical in developing the mRNA vaccine technology that enabled the swift creation of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that saved millions of lives at the height of the pandemic.\n\nAs such, the task force under the 1986 law has never been active. Though there are federal records of the task force existing between 1990 and 1998, it didn't produce any reports to Congress in that time. According to the law, it's supposed to report to Congress every two years.\n\nBut anti-vaccine advocates have for years fought for the creation of the panel, likely seeing it as a tool to further erode confidence in the safety of childhood vaccines. Kennedy himself sued the government in 2018 for information on the task force.\n\nEarlier this year, the outside counsel for the anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded and previously ran, Children's Health Defense, filed a lawsuit against Kennedy, seeking the creation of the task force. \"Why is he not dealing with vaccines?

Google says the new Gemma 3 270M can be tuned in a snap and maintains robust performance despite its small footprint.\n\nGoogle released its first Gemma 3 open models earlier this year, featuring between 1 billion and 27 billion parameters. In generative AI, the parameters are the learned variables that control how the model processes inputs to estimate output tokens. Generally, the more parameters in a model, the better it performs. With just 270 million parameters, the new Gemma 3 can run on devices like smartphones or even entirely inside a web browser.\n\nRunning an AI model locally has numerous benefits, including enhanced privacy and lower latency. Gemma 3 270M was designed with these kinds of use cases in mind. In testing with a Pixel 9 Pro, the new Gemma was able to run 25 conversations on the Tensor G4 chip and use just 0.75 percent of the device's battery. That makes it by far the most efficient Gemma model.\n\nCredit: Google Gemma 3 270M shows strong instruction-following for its small size.

They relied on the khipu system to track people, taxes, produce, livestock, and products like woven cloth and beer.\n\nBecause khipu were so vital to the Inca government, and because the khipu itself is such a sophisticated way of recording numbers, colonial writers decided that these tools must be the exclusive knowledge of a very specialized, elite class of bureaucrats.

I wondered if this was from a very high-status person indeed,” Hyland told Ars. “It was [a] surprise when we got the results back, and it showed that this person had the diet of a commoner.”\n\nThe threads that made up the khipu’s knotted strands had come from a camelid (probably an alpaca or llama), but those strands hung from a cord of human hair: a 104-centimeter-long set of locks, folded in half and twisted into a sturdy cord. Almost certainly, the person who made the khipu intended their hair to serve as a deeply personal signature for their work.

It's the latest breakthrough to come out of the Virginia Tech lab of mechanical engineer Jonathan Boreyko.\n\nA few years ago, Boreyko's lab experimentally demonstrated a three-phase Leidenfrost effect in water vapor, liquid water, and ice. The Leidenfrost effect is what happens when you dash a few drops of water onto a very hot, sizzling skillet. The drops levitate, sliding around the pan with wild abandon. If the surface is at least 400° Fahrenheit (well above the boiling point of water), cushions of water vapor, or steam, form underneath them, keeping them levitated. The effect also works with other liquids, including oils and alcohol, but the temperature at which it manifests will be different.\n\nBoreyko's lab discovered that this effect can also be achieved in ice simply by placing a thin, flat disc of ice on a heated aluminum surface. When the plate was heated above 150° C (302° F), the ice did not levitate on a vapor the way liquid water does. Instead, there was a significantly higher threshold of 550° Celsius (1,022° F) for levitation of the ice to occur. Unless that critical threshold is reached, the meltwater below the ice just keeps boiling in direct contact with the surface. Cross that critical point and you will get a three-phase Leidenfrost effect.\n\nThe key is a temperature differential in the meltwater just beneath the ice disc. The bottom of the meltwater is boiling, but the top of the meltwater sticks to the ice. It takes a lot to maintain such an extreme difference in temperature, and doing so consumes most of the heat from the aluminum surface, which is why it's harder to achieve levitation of an ice disc. Ice can suppress the Leidenfrost effect even at very high temperatures (up to 550° C), which means that using ice particles instead of liquid droplets would be better for many applications involving spray quenching: rapid cooling in nuclear power plants, for example, firefighting, or rapid heat quenching when shaping metals.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"water\", \"metal\", \"surface\", \"ice\", \"discs\", \"effect\", \"meltwater\", \"temperature\", \"liquid\", \"vapor\", \"leidenfrost\", \"slingshot\", \"lab\"]", "content_hash": "e402dd555850f0e275baea4af5055efe85b1f944a8ddfa642ad67f4e451df76a", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:54:59.256384+00:00"}

As its name implies, placing the radiometer in light produces a measurable change: the blades start spinning.\n\nUnfortunately, many people misunderstand the physics of its operation (which we'll return to shortly). The actual forces that drive the blades to spin, called photophoresis, can act on a variety of structures as long as they're placed in a sufficiently low-density atmosphere. Now, a team of researchers has figured out that it may be possible to use the photophoretic effect to loft thin sheets of metal into the upper atmosphere of Earth and other planets. While their idea is to use it to send probes to the portion of the atmosphere that's too high for balloons and too low for satellites, they have tested some working prototypes a bit closer to the Earth's surface.\n\nPhotophoresis\n\nIt's quite common—and quite wrong—to see explanations of the Crookes radiometer that involve radiation pressure. Supposedly, the dark sides of the blades absorb more photons, each of which carries a tiny bit of momentum, giving the dark side of the blades a consistent push. The problem with this explanation is that photons are bouncing off the silvery side, which imparts even more momentum. If the device were spinning due to radiation pressure, it would be turning in the opposite direction than it actually does.\n\nAn excess of the absorbed photons on the dark side is key to understanding how it works, though.

Google later dropped that mode, but a new attempt at customization is now rolling out. Gemini is getting an option called Personal Context. When enabled, the chatbot will remember details about your past conversations, adapting its replies without being specifically prompted.\n\nGoogle claims Personal Context will produce more relevant responses, particularly when you ask the chatbot to make recommendations. This is separate from the saved instructions feature, which allows you to provide explicit instructions for Gemini to be used in crafting outputs. This does have the potential to make Gemini feel more engaging, but that's not always a good thing. AI chatbots that get too friendly with the user can reinforce misconceptions and lead to delusional thinking, something we've seen distressingly often with AI models.\n\nCredit: Google\n\nTo start, this feature will be available with the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, but you won't get customization in the Eurpean Union,the UK, or Switzerland. It's also limited to users over the age of 18. Google says it will eventually release this feature in additional regions and with support for the more efficient Gemini 2.5 Flash model. You can turn Personal Context on and off at will from the main settings page.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"learn\", \"chatsunless\", \"google\", \"model\", \"wont\", \"gemini\", \"tell\", \"option\", \"chatbot\", \"context\", \"feature\", \"personal\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "23223cde48015a02ab1c1b5f18335987759848e0a9d7c249b9687b51cda1a083", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:10.127211+00:00"}

Two test flights of the Vulcan rocket last year gave military officials enough confidence to certify it for launching the Pentagon's medium-to-large space missions.\n\nUnited Launch Alliance's third 202-foot-tall (61.6-meter) Vulcan rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 8:56 pm EDT Tuesday (00:56 UTC Wednesday). Two methane-burning BE-4 main engines, supplied by Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin, and four solid-fueled boosters from Northrop Grumman powered the rocket off the launch pad with nearly 3 million pounds of thrust.\n\nThe rocket steered east from Florida's Space Coast and climbed through the atmosphere, shedding its four strap-on boosters, core stage, and payload fairing to fall into the Atlantic Ocean. Vulcan's Centaur upper stage ignited its RL10 engines several times to maneuver into a near-circular geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator.\n\nThese maneuvers took approximately seven hours to complete before the Centaur upper stage released its payloads to begin their missions. One of the satellites is an experimental platform to test next-generation technologies that may improve GPS navigation. There was at least one additional satellite—and perhaps more—aboard the rocket that the Space Force declined to discuss publicly.\n\nTaking a bite of the apple\n\nULA and Space Force officials declared success early Wednesday, celebrating the Vulcan rocket's entry into service as ULA begins the challenging task of working through a firm backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches on contract. Nearly all of the Vulcan launches have been booked by the Space Force's National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program and by Amazon for its Kuiper satellite broadband network.\n\nCol. Jim Horne, USSF-106 mission director, said in a statement, \"It’s an exciting day for us as we launched the first NSSL flight of Vulcan, an outstanding achievement for United Launch Alliance and the nation’s strategic space lift capability.

They're not something you use to commute to work or run errands. Instead, they're for riding to the coffee shop on weekends. This is a flawed line of thinking, and I'll tell you why, using two motorcycles as examples.\n\nBut first, hear me out. I live in Los Angeles, which is famous for its hellacious traffic. For motorcyclists, it's also famous because you get the ability to legally split lanes (i.e., ride between cars on the lane-dividing lines) and filter (i.e., ride between vehicles at a stoplight to get to the front), as well as its consistently gorgeous climate with a 365-day riding season. These factors aren't the case in every major city, but many of the benefits of motorcycling still apply elsewhere with the right gear and a can-do attitude.\n\nThe Italian\n\nFirst, the 2025 Ducati Monster SP.

In all that time, I can't recall a game that required the use of two mice at once.\n\nThat was true until I spent some time with Nintendo’s utterly unique Drag x Drive. The game asks you to take a Switch 2 Joy-Con in each hand, turn them both so the narrow edge lies on a flat-ish surface, and then slide them around to power a game of full-contact wheelchair basketball.\n\nIt’s a fresh control scheme that comes with its share of issues, mostly stemming from the lack of convenient mouse surfaces in most living rooms. With a little bit of practice, a good playing surface, and some online friends to play with, though, I found myself enjoying the high-impact, full-contact, precision positional gameplay enabled by holding a mouse in each hand for the first time.\n\nStill kind of buff from using the mouse\n\nWhen you picture using two mice at once, you might imagine each wrist making a series of small, controlled movements, one controlling lateral movement and the other controlling directional angle. Drag x Drive's dual-mouse controls bear no resemblance to this vision. Instead, you end up vigorously swiping each mouse forward or backward in constant sweeps; side-to-side movement is neither required nor useful.\n\nThat repetitive front-and-back swiping is mirrored by your avatar’s hand on the top side of either wheel on the wheelchair, creating a sort of tank-like control scheme where you turn by moving one wheel forward and one wheel backward. Small swipes of the mice can be used for precision angling, but more often, you’ll be sweeping the mouse in long lines to build speed. To shoot, you simply lift up a Joy-Con and mime a basketball shot a la Wii Sports Resort (your accuracy seems to have more to do with distance and your angle to the basket than real-world form, thankfully).", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"mouse\", \"drag\", \"game\", \"drive\", \"fun\", \"used\", \"movement\", \"x\", \"uniquely\", \"frustrating\", \"wheel\", \"wheelchair\", \"using\", \"mice\", \"mode\", \"showcase\", \"switch\", \"hand\"]", "content_hash": "2f959fcc86eee28b2f027de2b327c6b9448acfc8fc4127e043f55aab05180e1b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:14.665296+00:00"}

But it does seem to explain the Bluesky conundrum. Bluesky has no algorithm, for example, yet the same dynamics still seem to emerge. I think Bluesky's founders genuinely want to avoid those dysfunctional issues, but they might not succeed, based on this paper. Why are such interventions so ineffective?\n\nPetter Törnberg: We've been discussing whether these things are due to the platforms doing evil things with algorithms or whether we as users are choosing that we want a bad environment. What we're saying is that it doesn't have to be either of those. This is often the unintended outcomes from interactions based on underlying rules. It's not necessarily because the platforms are evil; it's not necessarily because people want to be in toxic, horrible environments. It just follows from the structure that we're providing.\n\nWe tested six different interventions. Google has been trying to make social media less toxic and recently released a newsfeed algorithm based on the content of the text. So that's one example. We're also trying to do more subtle interventions because often you can find a certain way of nudging the system so it switches over to healthier dynamics. Some of them have moderate or slightly positive effects on one of the attributes, but then they often have negative effects on another attribute, or they have no impact whatsoever.\n\nI should say also that these are very extreme interventions in the sense that, if you depended on making money on your platform, you probably don't want to implement them because it probably makes it really boring to use. It's like showing the least influential users, the least retweeted messages on the platform. Even so, it doesn't really make a difference in changing the basic outcomes. What we take from that is that the mechanism producing these problematic outcomes is really robust and hard to resolve given the basic structure of these platforms.\n\nArs Technica: So how might one go about building a successful social network that doesn't have these problems?\n\nPetter Törnberg: There are several directions where you could imagine going, but there's also the constraint of what is popular use. Think back to the early Internet, like ICQ. ICQ had this feature where you could just connect to a random person. I loved it when I was a kid. I would talk to random people all over the world. I was 12 in the countryside on a small island in Sweden, and I was talking to someone from Arizona, living a different life.

A quick look inside his eye revealed it was all due to a small worm, which they watched \"moving sluggishly\" in the back of his eyeball.\n\nTo gouge out the parasitic pillager, the doctors performed a pars plana vitrectomy—a procedure that involves sucking out some of the jelly-like vitreous inside the eye. This procedure can be used in the treatment of a variety of eye conditions, but using it to hoover up worms is rare. In order to get in, the doctors make tiny incisions in the white parts of the eye (the sclera) and use a hollow needle-like device with suction.

For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.\n\nThese boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters fell off the launcher moments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"officials\", \"key\", \"force\", \"solid\", \"launch\", \"heights\", \"rockets\", \"ulas\", \"boosters\", \"space\", \"test\", \"ahead\", \"vulcan\", \"rocket\", \"secrecy\"]", "content_hash": "f6c60a699e18f2d2e375598e8a6800f4c5a6c348a69e7e00c7cbc0749fae9264", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:24.182020+00:00"}

But the market for cycles with an electric assist has existed for considerably longer, and a number of companies predate the recent surge. One of them, Rad Power, has been around long enough that it was already an established presence when we first reviewed its hardware four years ago.\n\nThe company offers a mix of cargo, folding, and commuter bikes, all with electric assists. Having looked at a cargo version last time around, we decided to try out one of the commuter bikes this time. The Radster comes in road and trail versions (we tried the road). It's an incredibly solidly made bike with equally solid components, and it has very good implementations of a few things that other manufacturers haven't handled all that well. It also can switch among the three classes of e-bikes using a menu option; unfortunately, nothing else about the bike's performance seems to change with the switch.\n\nThe Radster is priced a bit higher than a lot of its budget competitors. So, if you're shopping, you'll have to think a bit about whether some of these features matter to you.\n\nA solid option\n\nOne thing that is very clear early: The Radster is a very solid bike with a robust frame. While the frame is step-through, it has some added bracing just above the cranks. These two bars, one on each side of the frame, link the down tube to the seat tube and extend to form part of the rear triangle. While this means you'll have to step a bit higher to get in a position to mount the bike, they contribute to the sense that this is a frame that will withstand years of daily use.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"frame\", \"road\", \"solid\", \"powers\", \"radster\", \"tube\", \"commuter\", \"bike\", \"bikes\", \"nonradical\", \"number\", \"bit\", \"rad\", \"youll\"]", "content_hash": "0c917dce2a95a9236ceb5393ef168420e753c1489d425c6f03b399784f76ffab", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:27.264844+00:00"}

They've warned that a single lawsuit raised by three authors over Anthropic's AI training now threatens to \"financially ruin\" the entire AI industry if up to 7 million claimants end up joining the litigation and forcing a settlement.\n\nLast week, Anthropic petitioned to appeal the class certification, urging the court to weigh questions that the district court judge, William Alsup, seemingly did not. Alsup allegedly failed to conduct a \"rigorous analysis\" of the potential class and instead based his judgment on his \"50 years\" of experience, Anthropic said.\n\nIf the appeals court denies the petition, Anthropic argued, the emerging company may be doomed. As Anthropic argued, it now \"faces hundreds of billions of dollars in potential damages liability at trial in four months\" based on a class certification rushed at \"warp speed\" that involves \"up to seven million potential claimants, whose works span a century of publishing history,\" each possibly triggering a $150,000 fine.\n\nConfronted with such extreme potential damages, Anthropic may lose its rights to raise valid defenses of its AI training, deciding it would be more prudent to settle, the company argued. And that could set an alarming precedent, considering all the other lawsuits generative AI (GenAI) companies face over training on copyrighted materials, Anthropic argued.\n\n\"One district court's errors should not be allowed to decide the fate of a transformational GenAI company like Anthropic or so heavily influence the future of the GenAI industry generally,\" Anthropic wrote. \"This Court can and should intervene now.\"\n\nIn a court filing Thursday, the Consumer Technology Association and the Computer and Communications Industry Association backed Anthropic, warning the appeals court that \"the district court’s erroneous class certification\" would threaten \"immense harm not only to a single AI company, but to the entire fledgling AI industry and to America’s global technological competitiveness.\"", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"industry\", \"potential\", \"genai\", \"district\", \"court\", \"company\", \"class\", \"horrified\", \"copyright\", \"certified\", \"anthropic\", \"largest\", \"training\", \"ai\", \"action\", \"face\"]", "content_hash": "1babe99e43b63fc9cc12b4a796a99d2e748c0a43c2820456f461dc5bf687d30b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:28.604436+00:00"}

Not only is Framework navigating into a product category where its main innovation and claim to fame is totally unnecessary. But it’s actually doing that with a desktop that’s less upgradeable and modular than any given self-built desktop PC.\n\nThe Framework Desktop has a lot of interesting design touches, and it's automatically a better buy than the weird AMD Ryzen AI Max-based mini desktops you can buy from a couple of no-name manufacturers. But aside from being more considerate of PC industry standards, the Framework Desktop asks the same question that any gaming-focused mini PC does: Do you care about having a small machine so much that you would pay more money for less performance, and for a system you can't upgrade much after you buy it?\n\nDesign and assembly\n\nAndrew Cunningham Opening the Framework Desktop's box.

Raj Agrawal, the former commander of the Space Force's Space Mission Delta 2.\n\nIf it seems like there's a satellite launch almost every day, the numbers will back you up.\n\nThe US Space Force's Mission Delta 2 is a unit that reports to Space Operations Command, with the job of sorting out the nearly 50,000 trackable objects humans have launched into orbit.\n\nDozens of satellites are being launched each week, primarily by SpaceX to continue deploying the Starlink broadband network. The US military has advance notice of these launches—most of them originate from Space Force property—and knows exactly where they're going and what they're doing.\n\nThat's usually not the case when China or Russia (and occasionally Iran or North Korea) launches something into orbit. With rare exceptions, like human spaceflight missions, Chinese and Russian officials don't publish any specifics about what their rockets are carrying or what altitude they're going to.\n\nThat creates a problem for military operators tasked with monitoring traffic in orbit and breeds anxiety among US forces responsible for making sure potential adversaries don't gain an edge in space. Will this launch deploy something that can destroy or disable a US satellite? Will this new satellite have a new capability to surveil allied forces on the ground or at sea?\n\nOf course, this is precisely the point of keeping launch details under wraps. The US government doesn't publish orbital data on its most sensitive satellites, such as spy craft collecting intelligence on foreign governments.\n\nBut you can't hide in low-Earth orbit, a region extending hundreds of miles into space.

Many of those problems have persisted, but little by little, foldables have gotten better. With the release of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has made the biggest leap yet. This device solves some of the most glaring problems with Samsung's foldables, featuring a new, slimmer design and a big camera upgrade.\n\nSamsung's seventh-generation foldable has finally crossed that hazy boundary between novelty and practicality, putting a tablet-sized screen in your pocket without as many compromises. There are still some drawbacks, of course, but for the first time, this feels like a foldable phone you'd want to carry around.\n\nWhether or not you can justify the $1,999 price tag is another matter entirely.\n\nMost improved foldable\n\nEarlier foldable phones were pocket-busting bricks, but companies like Google, Huawei, and OnePlus have made headway streamlining the form factor—the Pixel 9 Pro Fold briefly held the title of thinnest foldable when it launched last year. Samsung, however, stuck with the same basic silhouette for versions one through six, shaving off a millimeter here and there with each new generation. Now, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has successfully leapfrogged the competition with an almost unbelievably thin profile.\n\nSpecs at a glance: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 - $1,999 SoC Snapdragon 8 Elite Memory 12GB, 16GB Storage 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Display Cover: 6.5-inch 1080×2520 120 Hz OLED\n\nInternal: 8-inch 1968×2184 120 Hz flexible OLED Cameras 200MP primary, f/1.7, OIS; 10 MP telephoto, f/2.4, OIS; 12 MP ultrawide, f/2.2; 10 MP selfie cameras (internal and external), f/2.2 Software Android 16, 7 years of OS updates Battery 4,400 mAh, 25 W wired charging, 15 W wireless charging Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, NFC, Bluetooth 5.4, sub-6 GHz and mmWave 5G, USB-C 3.2 Measurements Folded: 158.4×72.8×8.9 mm\n\nUnfolded: 158.4×143.2×4.2 mm\n\n215 g\n\nClocking in at just 215 g and 8.9 mm thick when folded, the Z Fold 7 looks and feels like a regular smartphone when closed. It's lighter than Samsung's flagship flat phone, the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and is only a fraction of a millimeter thicker. The profile is now limited by the height of the standard USB-C port.

Such an outbreak is not particularly surprising; the reason the vast majority of milk is pasteurized (heated briefly to kill germs) is because milk can easily pick up nasty pathogens in the farmyard that can cause severe illnesses, particularly in children. It's the reason public health officials have long and strongly warned against consuming raw milk.\n\nAt the time of the press release, officials in San Diego County had identified nine residents who had been sickened in the outbreak. Of those nine, three were children, and all three children had been hospitalized.\n\nOn October 25, the county put out a second press release, reporting that the local case count had risen to 12, and the suspected culprit—raw milk and raw cream from Raw Farm LLC—had been recalled. The same day, Orange County's health department put out its own press release, reporting seven cases among its residents, including one in a 1-year-old infant.\n\nBoth counties noted that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), which had posted the recall notice, was working on the outbreak, too. But it doesn't appear that CDPH ever followed up with its own press release about the outbreak. The CDPH did write social media posts related to the outbreak: One on October 26, 2023, announced the recall; a second on November 30, 2023, noted \"a recent outbreak\" of Salmonella cases from raw milk but linked to general information about the risks of raw milk; and a third on December 7, 2023, linked to general information again with no mention of the outbreak.\n\nBut that seems to be the extent of the information at the time. For anyone paying attention, it might have seemed like the end of the story. But according to the final outbreak investigation report—produced by CDPH and local health officials—the outbreak actually ran from September 2023 to March 2024, spanned five states, and sickened at least 171 people.

We present part of our discussion with Agrawal below, and we'll share the rest of the conversation later this week. The text has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nArs: The Space Force's role in monitoring activities in space has changed a lot in the last few years. Can you tell me about these changes, and what's the difference between what you used to call Space Situational Awareness, and what is now called Space Domain Awareness?\n\nAgrawal: We just finished our fifth year as a Space Force, so as a result of standing up a military service focused on space, we shifted our activities to focus on what the joint force requires for combat space power. We've been doing space operations for going on seven decades. I think a lot of folks think that it was a rebranding, as opposed to a different focus for space operations, and it couldn’t be further from the truth. Compared to Space Domain Awareness (SDA), Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is kind of the knowledge we produce with all these sensors, and anybody can do space situational awareness. You have academia doing that. You've got commercial, international partners, and so on. But Space Domain Awareness, Gen. [John \"Jay\"] Raymond coined the term a couple years before we stood up the Space Force, and he was trying to get after, how do we create a domain focused on operational outcomes? That's all we could say at the time. We couldn't say war-fighting domain at the time because of the way of our policy, but our policy shifted to being able to talk about space as a place where, not that we want to wage war, but that we can achieve objectives, and do that with military objectives in mind.\n\nWe used to talk about detect, characterize, attribute, predict. And then Gen. [Chance] Saltzman added target onto the construct for Space Domain Awareness, so that we're very much in the conversation of what it means to do a space-enabled attack and being able to achieve objectives in, from, and to space, and using Space Domain Awareness as a vehicle to do those things. So, with Mission Delta 2, what he did is he took the sustainment part of acquisition, software development, cyber defense, intelligence related to Space Domain Awareness, and then all the things that we were doing in Space Domain Awareness already, put all that together under one command ... and called us Mission Delta 2. So, the 18th Space Defense Squadron ... that used to kind of be the center of the world for Space Domain Awareness, maybe the only unit that you could say was really doing SDA, where everyone else was kind of doing SSA. When I came into command a couple years ago, and we face now a real threat to having space superiority in the space domain, I disaggregated what we were doing just in the 18th and spread out through a couple of other units ... So, that way everyone's got kind of majors and minors, but we can quickly move a mission in case we get tested in terms of cyber defense or other kinds of vulnerabilities.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"copheres\", \"domain\", \"say\", \"doing\", \"awareness\", \"used\", \"mission\", \"spoke\", \"objectives\", \"militarys\", \"kind\", \"space\", \"learned\", \"orbital\", \"situational\", \"traffic\", \"chief\", \"ars\"]", "content_hash": "2ac66c9d8d640fce9ba54aab777833d424f2764179240ed1e741f7f9eaba98fb", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:40.212812+00:00"}

That's a common practice in many courts, where overburdened judges historically rely on lawyers to draft orders. But that protocol today faces heightened scrutiny as lawyers and non-lawyers increasingly rely on AI to compose and research legal filings, and judges risk rubberstamping fake opinions by not carefully scrutinizing AI-generated citations.\n\nThe errant order partly relied on \"two fictitious cases\" to deny the wife's petition—which Watkins suggested were \"possibly 'hallucinations' made up by generative-artificial intelligence\"—as well as two cases that had \"nothing to do\" with the wife's petition.\n\nLynch was hit with $2,500 in sanctions after the wife appealed, and the husband's response—which also appeared to be prepared by Lynch—cited 11 additional cases that were \"either hallucinated\" or irrelevant.

The German marque has introduced a monthly subscription fee to access the full performance of some of its ID.3 electric vehicles.\n\nAuto Express spotted that the Volkswagen ID.3 Pro and Pro S were listed in the UK as producing 201bhp, but could hit 228bhp — if customers paid extra. For that extra 27bhp, buyers can pay £16.50 per month, £165 annually, or £649 for a lifetime subscription that transfers with the car if it’s resold.\n\nVolkswagen described the add-on as an “optional power upgrade.”\n\n“If customers wish to have an even sportier driving experience, they now have an option to do so, within the life of the vehicle, rather than committing from the outset with a higher initial purchase price,” the company said in a statement.\n\nVolkswagen is not the first automaker to introduce tiered subscription services. European car makers have proven particularly fond of the model, with the likes of BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Polestar all offering upgrades via monthly fees.\n\nThe companies argue that plans provide control, flexibility, and ongoing updates. They also give carmakers ongoing cash flow, upselling opportunities post-purchase, and a valuable source of customer data. In essence, they’re turning cars into platforms — replicating a model that’s become ubiquitous in software.\n\nGone are the days of one-off payments for apps. Subscriptions, popularised by Spotify, Netflix, and productivity apps in the early 2010s, are now the dominant model.\n\nThere’s even now a category of tools that cancel unwanted subscriptions.

Better yet, we could spark a good old-fashioned outcry. It worked for BMW customers, whose fury over monthly fees for heated seats already in their cars led the company to scrap the plans.\n\nAlternatively, we could simply wait for subscription creep to spread across our entire lives, until some tech lord starts charging a monthly fee for the air we breathe.

Over the last decade, we’ve laid the foundation for a thriving digital economy, from regulatory leadership to tech-driven reforms and rapidly growing regional hubs. But infrastructure alone doesn’t build the future; people do. And today, we face the very human challenge of how to win — and retain — the talent that powers innovation.\n\nWe’re seeing highly skilled individuals, such as founders, engineers, and product leaders, move their operations or careers to the US and, in some cases, to Asia. This trend reflects global competition at its fiercest. But it’s also a moment to reflect on what can make Europe uniquely capable of attracting and keeping the tech talent it needs.\n\nWhy talent moves — and why that’s not the whole story\n\nIn a deeply interconnected global market, talent follows opportunity. The US, for example, offers late-stage capital at a scale that’s still difficult to match in Europe. Its unified domestic market allows startups to grow without navigating the complex regulatory borders we often find in Europe. In areas like AI and deep tech, there are simply more large-scale deployments and resources to attract engineers hungry to push boundaries.\n\nBut talent doesn’t just move in one direction. Many entrepreneurs return with sharper skills, not only to build European ventures but also to reconnect with a sense of home and achieve a better work-life balance. Increasingly, founders are building cross-border teams, running product and engineering out of Europe while scaling sales or partnerships globally.\n\nEurope faces a test of its competitiveness and confidence in the global fight for talent. I believe we can meet this test, not by mimicking other ecosystems but by focusing on what sets us apart.\n\nSweden as a showcase of European strength\n\nSweden provides a powerful example of Europe’s strengths. With 41 unicorns, it ranks among the top 10 countries globally. Stockholm, its capital, is second only to Silicon Valley in unicorns per capita. Startups from Sweden have scaled globally yet stayed rooted in a strong local ecosystem.\n\nWhat’s made that possible isn’t just capital — it’s also driven by a culture of trust, digital readiness, innovative infrastructure and long-term investment in education. Higher education is tuition-free for EU citizens, and digital public services, such as e-ID, have long been integrated into everyday life. There is a consistent alignment between the public and private sectors in supporting entrepreneurship.\n\nThis kind of foundation doesn’t guarantee success, but it does create a platform for talent to grow — and stay. And Sweden isn’t alone in fostering these conditions. Across the continent, cities like Tallinn, Lisbon, Berlin, and Málaga are developing tech ecosystems rooted in local strengths and specialisations — turning them into hubs for talent.\n\nEurope’s strengths are structural and undervalued\n\nEurope is often criticised — sometimes fairly — for being over-regulated, with policies that can slow down product cycles or add complexity for startups. However, these standards also serve a deeper purpose: to build the trust desired by modern consumers and talent alike.\n\nAdditionally, Europe invests early and equitably in its people. Many countries provide universal healthcare, subsidised childcare and free or low-cost education, reducing the personal financial risk of founding or joining a startup. For employees, this creates a broader sense of safety and support that extends beyond the workplace. This stability can be invaluable, giving more people the freedom to take meaningful entrepreneurial risks.\n\nEurope tends to foster a different growth environment for startups than other global markets. With less access to hyper-scale capital, companies often grow at a more deliberate pace than their US counterparts. Stronger work protections and greater awareness of a startup’s footprint can also appeal to talent seeking more than just fast exits. For many of today’s builders, sustainability isn’t just about metrics, but about values.\n\nOf course, the picture isn’t perfect. Fragmented regulation across EU member states, limited access to late-stage growth capital and complex cross-border hiring all create friction. In recent months, we’ve seen companies, particularly in fintech, tighten operations or shift capital toward the US, as global investors seek quicker returns and more predictable scaling environments. That dynamic risks pushing top talent out of Europe.\n\nBut these challenges aren’t unsolvable — and they’re not reasons to be pessimistic. They’re signals that we need to evolve faster, more boldly, and with a greater sense of cohesion across the continent.\n\nWhat Europe must do next\n\nTo stop these forces from driving talent away, the first step is to reclaim the narrative. Europe is not a junior partner in global innovation; it is already leading in areas such as open banking, green technology and privacy-first digital services. Rather than framing all regulation as a burden, we should position certain key regulations as a competitive advantage. It creates stability and transparency that today’s talent and investors increasingly value. If we want the next generation of entrepreneurs to build here, they need to believe in the vision, and that starts with how we tell our story.\n\nSecond, Europe must address its regulatory fragmentation if it wants to unlock its full innovation potential. While our diversity is a strength, inconsistent rules across member states — from tax and employment law to data compliance and licensing — create friction for startups looking to operate across borders. This patchwork forces founders to choose between cities, when they should be able to build seamlessly throughout the bloc. Greater harmonisation of startup-relevant policies and more integrated funding mechanisms across markets would make Europe feel like one cohesive innovation space for tech talent, rather than a patchwork of jurisdictions.\n\nThe continent also needs to invest in homegrown innovation, retain ownership of its core digital infrastructure, and protect its intellectual property. That requires a stronger late-stage funding environment, more ambitious public-private R&D initiatives, and long-term support for innovative companies. It means continuing to build on what makes Europe unique. To deepen the talent pool, the continent’s long-term thinking, inclusivity, and sense of responsibility should be harnessed as competitive strengths, not just soft ideals.\n\nA tech ecosystem worth building and staying for\n\nTalent doesn’t only follow money — it also follows meaning. Today’s innovators want to work in environments where they can create real impact. They are looking for flexibility, diversity, trust and purpose. Europe is uniquely positioned to meet those expectations — if it embraces what makes it different. In a changing and uncertain world, Europe remains a stable democracy, offering a degree of security that can attract investor interest and capital.\n\nThis is not a zero-sum game — and talent going abroad doesn’t mean Europe is losing. However, if we want to be a global innovation leader in the decade ahead, we need to champion our values, remove barriers, and tell our own story more effectively. If we do that, we can make Europe the place where world-class talent not only begins, but also belongs.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"global\", \"win\", \"talent\", \"tech\", \"startups\", \"battle\", \"build\", \"doesnt\", \"europe\", \"capital\", \"digital\", \"innovation\"]", "content_hash": "aebbb137a9a47d42eff30a799e68d2b12bddb18a0fa595bb3e9592a82c9cfdb1", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:48.603647+00:00"}

Launched in 2021, the machine has been fully operational since July 2022.\n\nWebb isn’t just an upgrade from Hubble. It’s a time machine, an infrared sentinel, and — maybe most importantly — a destroyer of comfortable scientific assumptions.\n\nThanks to its findings, it’s becoming clear that we’re on the cusp of a major shift in theoretical physics and cosmology. Over the next few years, expect a wave of bold new theories, revisions to textbooks, and a renewed debate about everything from gravity to the origin of galaxies.\n\nBefore we consider the implications, let’s zoom out and consider the big discoveries from Webb that punch holes in what we thought we knew about the universe. Some of these are already triggering theoretical crises. Others might trigger entirely new fields of inquiry and invention.\n\nThe biggest revolutions start when theory no longer matches data. That’s what happened with quantum mechanics. With general relativity. With DNA. And maybe, with the Webb Telescope.\n\nHere are 10 of its discoveries challenging our theories about the universe:\n\n1. The universe is expanding faster than it should\n\nWe knew about the “Hubble Tension,” but Webb just confirmed it with more precision. According to the maths, the universe is expanding at 70–76 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc) — much faster than the 67 km/s/Mpc predicted by models based on the early universe (the cosmic microwave background). Translation? Something in our physics is wrong, or at least incomplete. A tweak to dark energy? A new force? A misunderstood early universe? The door is open.\n\n2. Galaxies grew up too fast\n\nWebb spotted fully-grown, massive galaxies just 500–700 million years after the Big Bang. These things are as large as the Milky Way, but their early appearance defies established science. According to the standard cosmological models, they simply shouldn’t exist yet. Theories say galaxies grow slowly. Reality says: they bulked up fast. Either we’re missing a trick — or the early universe was a lot more efficient than we thought.\n\n3. Dark matter may be wrong — MOND was right?\n\nThis one’s controversial: Webb’s findings align more with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) than the prevailing dark matter theory. MOND has long been the underdog of gravity theories. But if early galaxies are brighter and bigger than expected — just as MOND predicted — we may need to reconsider which invisible hand is shaping the cosmos.\n\n4. Black holes were way too ambitious\n\nHow do you get a 9-million-solar-mass black hole only 570 million years after the Big Bang? That’s what Webb found. This is astonishing because, according to current models, there simply wasn’t enough time or material in the early universe to grow such colossal black holes so quickly — suggesting either unknown physics or entirely new formation pathways. The black holes in some early galaxies are 1,000x more massive (relative to the galaxy) than those in today’s universe. Either black holes formed via some exotic mechanism — or they started as something much bigger than stars.\n\n5. Complex chemistry? This early?\n\nThe galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 is just 300 million years old, but it’s already rich in elements like nitrogen, which usually takes billions of years and several generations of stars to build up. How did those elements get there? Either the first stars formed and died much faster than we thought — or the Big Bang left us more “pre-built” than expected.\n\n6. Stars formed at warp speed\n\nWebb shows early galaxies as intense, explosive star factories — a surprise to scientists. Models expected slow, gradual star formation. Instead, it’s “giant balls of star formation.” Something — perhaps a lack of dust, or different physics — accelerated the timeline. And, again, the models can’t keep up.\n\n7. Planetary disks last longer than we thought\n\nPlanet-forming disks around stars were assumed to vanish quickly. But Webb sees them lasting 20–30 million years. That’s great news for exoplanet formation — and potentially for life. If planetary systems have more time to develop, life-friendly environments may be more common than we ever dared to hope.\n\n8. Galaxies were weirdly shaped\n\nHalf of early galaxies look like pool noodles or surfboards, not the small round blobs we expected. The standard model says structure comes later. But Webb’s showing us that galaxies got organised early — and in shapes we weren’t expecting. Something about angular momentum and matter dynamics in the early universe needs rethinking.\n\n9. Exoplanet atmosphere models are all wrong\n\nWebb’s ultra-precise spectroscopy revealed that our models of exoplanet atmospheres can’t reliably distinguish between different kinds. This shakes up everything from habitability estimates to the search for biosignatures. Basically, our “spectral fingerprints” are smudged — and it’s back to the drawing board.\n\n10. The cosmic web was already there\n\nWebb found a 3-million-light-year-long filament — part of the cosmic web — just 830 million years after the Big Bang. This structure was supposed to take billions of years to form. So either the early universe built things quickly, or we’ve fundamentally misunderstood the timeline.\n\nSo what does this mean for the tech ecosystem? For founders and VCs in deep tech, these findings aren’t just scientific trivia; they’re early signals.\n\nEurope’s ideas in focus\n\nIn our view, Europe is uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of innovation sparked by James Webb’s discoveries. The data streaming in is already catalysing new research efforts at leading centres like Germany’s Max Planck Institutes, the University of Cambridge in the UK, and ETH Zurich in Switzerland.\n\nIn the private sector, a new generation of European deep tech startups is rising to the challenge.\n\nSpace Forge (UK) is developing reusable satellites to enable in-space manufacturing of advanced materials — such as semiconductors — that could drastically reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, with major implications for the climate crisis.\n\nBioOrbit (UK) is advancing microgravity-enabled production of anti-cancer biologics, with the potential to shift some therapies from hospital IV drips to self-administered injections at home, radically improving patient access and comfort.\n\nAIrmo (Germany) is deploying a fleet of LIDAR-equipped satellites and drones to precisely monitor greenhouse gas emissions in real time — supporting industries in meeting increasingly stringent EU regulations to report GHG emissions.\n\nEuropean deep tech companies are increasingly supported by Horizon Europe, the EU’s flagship research and innovation programme (2021–2027) with a total budget of €95.5 billion. Horizon Europe backs high-risk, high-reward projects across climate, digital, and deep tech domains, serving as a critical bridge between frontier scientific discoveries — like those revealed by JWST — and breakthrough commercial applications.\n\nGaps in our understanding of the universe could open unexpected opportunities for European deep tech. Just as CERN put Europe at the forefront of high-energy physics, Webb could become a launchpad for the continent’s space tech industry.\n\nWebb’s discoveries could spark a new era of innovation by overturning everything we thought we knew about the universe. If the early universe is nothing like we expected, then what else might we be wrong about?\n\nCould the laws of physics themselves evolve? Are we missing hidden variables in space-time? Is dark matter an illusion, and if so, what’s really shaping galaxies? Could life have started earlier and more often than we imagine?\n\nEvery one of these questions could unlock a new wave of fundamental physics, new technologies, or even entirely new startup categories. From quantum gravity models to exotic materials to AI-designed cosmological simulations, there’s room here for founders to build at the edge of mystery.\n\nWhat next? Potentially a new generation of inventions, investors, and eye-opening discoveries. Europe is poised to take advantage.\n\nBy investing in deep tech, the continent can turn Webb’s revelations into commercial successes, shaping the future of science and society alike.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"webb\", \"telescope\", \"shape\", \"early\", \"models\", \"tech\", \"discoveries\", \"european\", \"deep\", \"lessons\", \"space\", \"universe\", \"galaxies\", \"james\", \"physics\"]", "content_hash": "75b4764a4c77944ab90a08e4c1a374f1aa3a51bc8414b1640939c8784494e3ca", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:49.269577+00:00"}

Access to goods, services, and information not just for the few, but for everyone.\n\nVictoria Slivkoff, Head of Ecosystem at Walden Catalyst and Managing Director of Extreme Tech Challenge — a nonprofit uniting startups and VCs to accelerate progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — is excited for what lies ahead. In her view, the physical manifestation of AI could bring us closer to realising these ambitious goals.\n\n“Now we’re moving into the area of reasoning. AI is not just aggregating and organising information, it’s actually making predictions and drawing conclusions. How does that translate to the real world where robots can sense, learn, and interact with their surroundings?” she said to TNW founder Boris Veldhuijzen van Zaten in the latest episode of “Kia’s Next Big Drive.”\n\nWatch the full interview where Victoria and Boris discuss how we can leverage emerging technologies for positive global impact as they drive to TNW2025 in Kia’s 100% electric EV9 SUV.\n\nIn the not too distant future, we could be living in a world where robots are regularly navigating busy streets, offices, and classrooms. But as they become more common in our daily lives, is it them or us who will need to adapt most?\n\nRobots jumping the queue\n\nPicture this: you’re waiting for the elevator and a robot arrives at the same time. Who goes in first? If there’s only room for one, would you expect the robot to step aside, or would you treat it like a human and follow a “first come, first serve” approach?\n\nPast studies have found that most people expect service robots to be submissive, leading humans to prioritise themselves during conflicts, even in instances when a robot’s task was more urgent.\n\nWhat if a robot is carrying out a time specific task? The longer it waits until there are no humans in the queue, the longer it will take to complete it, whether it’s delivering a warm pizza or life saving medical supplies. So, how should robots navigate these social nuances without being ignored, undermined, or even bullied?\n\nThat’s what researchers aimed to find out last year in a study titled A Robot Jumping the Queue: Expectations About Politeness and Power During Conflicts in Everyday Human-Robot Encounters.\n\nThe researchers found that these robot-human interactions were more effective if participants expected an assertive robot which then asked politely for priority and entered first. But it’s not just robots that need to prepare to integrate into human society. The researchers highlighted that we may also need to rethink our attitudes and behaviours towards robots:\n\n“Should we maybe start thinking of service robots as having certain rights regarding priority if they fulfil human jobs with human responsibilities — or act as proxies for people? This might also help address the issue of robot bullying.”\n\nAs robots take on not only more responsibilities but also develop reason and sentience, at what point should we begin rethinking their social status?\n\nRobot teachers\n\nSocial robots — designed to communicate and interact with humans — are increasingly being used in caregiving, education, and mental health. In these settings, they help bridge service gaps, ease isolation, and offer emotional or learning support.\n\nUtrecht University of Applied Sciences is among those researching how robots can do more than just fill in; they can augment and enrich human-centred fields. For example:\n\nIn healthcare, how can robots be used to ease pre-procedure anxiety in children? Or help teach emotional skills for young patients who struggle with emotion regulation.\n\nAt last year’s Lowlands Science festival, the University showcased WOKEbot, a project exploring how a robot’s appearance and narrative voice (first vs. third person) influence human openness when discussing polarising topics.\n\n“Disagreements are timeless. People often manage to resolve them, but sometimes they simply can’t reach each other anymore. We saw this happen on a large scale not so long ago during the coronavirus pandemic. Are you for or against vaccination? When people dig in their heels and polarisation threatens, it can be helpful to have a neutral moderator,” said Dr. Mirjam de Haas. “The advantage of robots is that they are more neutral than humans. While you might be reserved with a person, a robot can make you more open and receptive to a different perspective.”\n\nAs part of her PhD research, Dr. Haas also conducted a number of successful experiments in using robotics to teach Dutch as a second language to students from linguistically diverse backgrounds. In her thesis defence, Dr. Haas explained that in the future, more and more students will fill classrooms. Having a robot aid will help facilitate learning for all students, including those with learning disabilities or those who are not yet fluent in Dutch.\n\nIs the world safe for robots?\n\nPerhaps the most recognisable robot in popular culture is The Terminator. In the first movie, a cyborg is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of humanity’s future leader. But, in the sequel, our villain returns with a new mission: to save humanity.\n\nThe SDGs were adopted by all UN members in 2015. Ten years on, in a world sliding further away from the 17 promises laid out for people and the planet, could robots deployed for good be the key to bringing us back to our humanity?", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"robots\", \"need\", \"researchers\", \"robot\", \"ready\", \"students\", \"human\", \"world\", \"help\", \"service\", \"live\", \"humans\"]", "content_hash": "2b91ee36a3a841c71e2f8c1725643ea20687ffd442d080e2274f5540b12fab82", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:50.181772+00:00"}

It doesn’t look like your typical lunch fare, but this unassuming dust could play a crucial role in the future of food.\n\nBekers is the co-founder of MicroHarvest, a Hamburg and Lisbon-based startup that turns agricultural waste streams into protein powder using microbes — tiny organisms that exist all around us. The vegan ingredient is already making its way into dog treats. If all goes to plan, human snacks like protein bars, shakes, and ice cream won’t be far behind.\n\nI visited the company’s Lisbon pilot plant on a sweltering summer afternoon last month. It’s tucked inside the Unicorn Factory, a sprawling industrial space on the city’s eastern edge that used to churn out pasta and cookies for the Portuguese military. Now, instead of carbs for soldiers, it’s housing bubbling vats of bacteria.\n\nLaunched in 2022, the Unicorn Factory houses some of Portugal’s most promising startups. Credit: Unicorn Factory\n\nAt the centre of the lab sits a large steel fermenter with a small porthole, through which you can see a thick brown soup gurgling away. Inside, billions of microbes are feasting on leftover sugars from the agri-industry, multiplying like microscopic gremlins. Once they’ve done their job, they’re killed and dried into protein-rich powder.\n\n“We prefer to say they’re ‘inactivated’,” Bekers, who is originally from the Netherlands, tells TNW with a chuckle. “It sounds nicer.”\n\nThe final product looks like light brown flour and smells faintly like Marmite. It packs a serious nutritional punch — around 60% raw protein, plus a mix of fibre, amino acids, and other nutrients.\n\nMicroHarvest’s powder joins a crowded buffet of alt-protein options — think lab-grown chicken, algae nuggets, pea patties, and mycoprotein steaks. But Bekers is convinced that microbes earn their spot on the plate.\n\n“What we’re producing is much more efficient than plant or animal-based proteins,” she says. “You don’t need acres of land or gallons of water. Our microbes grow in days, not months or years, and they convert feed into protein with incredible efficiency.”\n\nA portal into the future of ferming? Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest’s fermentation process takes less than 24 hours — lightning fast compared to growing soy or raising cows. It is estimated to slash land use by 99% and cuts CO2 emissions by over 70% compared to beef.\n\nA 2022 study in Nature found that replacing just 20% of global beef consumption with microbial proteins could cut annual deforestation in half by 2050. Plus, bioreactors like MicroHarvest’s could be deployed pretty much anywhere there’s a significant agricultural industry.\n\nOf course, the idea of eating dried bacteria might raise a few eyebrows — or stomachs. But Bekers is quick to draw comparisons to foods we already know and love.\n\n“These are similar to the microbes you find in things like yoghurt, kimchi, or sauerkraut,” she says. “Food is a cultural phenomenon, and we get that. We’re not trying to replace your steak or convert everyone to veganism. We’re just adding another protein to the menu.”\n\nFermenting the future\n\nMicroHarvest’s protein powder can be added into all sorts of foods. It also makes for an effective thickening agent. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nMicroHarvest is one of Europe’s best-known microbial protein producers, but the scene is bubbling with competition. Startups across the continent and beyond are experimenting with different microbes and feedstocks — from Germany’s Formo making alt dairy to the UK’s Enough turning fungi into meat.\n\nMeanwhile, corporate giants like Nestlé and Unilever are testing the waters through partnerships and pilot launches.\n\nGlobally, almost $1bn (€874mn) flowed into fermentation-based alt-protein startups last year, according to Dealroom data. Europe attracted nearly half of that, with 2024 marking the sector’s highest funding year ever on the continent.\n\nAlongside that, the EU unveiled a new €350mn funding strategy in July to accelerate the scale-up of fermentation tech, as the continent seeks to tackle its deep-rooted addiction to meat.\n\nEven replacing a portion of our protein consumption with a fermented alternative is a compelling proposition. It could significantly reduce the land and water needed for farming while slashing carbon emissions. But the transition is not without its challenges.\n\nFrom pets to people\n\nSwapping steak for microbes isn’t as easy as simply building more bioreactors. Fermented proteins currently face high production costs and a battle to win over sceptical consumers, whose opinions on food choices often become embroiled in culture wars.\n\nThen there’s the regulatory red tape. It’s unclear when — or even if — MicroHarvest will get the green light for human consumption. The lengthy approval process for alt-protein products has bogged down other startups in the space. One example is Dutch cultivated meat brand Meatable, which has spent years navigating the regulatory hurdles. Founded in 2018, the company is still awaiting approval to sell its products commercially. It’s now focusing on Singapore, where lawmakers have been more welcoming to alt-proteins than their counterparts in Europe.\n\nMicroHarvest nonetheless remains optimistic. The startup has already submitted a full dossier to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) seeking regulatory approval for human consumption of its fermented protein.\n\n“We’re really confident we’ll get it,” says Bekers. “We screened the full DNA of the strain, checked for any harmful potential, and submitted a very complete dossier.”\n\nMicroHarvest’s founders (left to right) Jonathan Roberz, Luisa Cruz, and Katelijne Bekers. Credit: MicroHarvest\n\nFor now, MicroHarvest plans to scale through another customer segment: pets. Last year, MicroHarvest teamed up with Munich-based startup VegDog to launch its first commercial product — a vegan dog treat made with microbial protein.\n\nAnimal nutrition has fewer regulatory barriers than products for human consumption. The availability of conventional pet food and fish feed also falls short of current demand.\n\n“The pet and aquaculture industries are growing rapidly, but the supply of feed is not,” says Bekers, adding that pet food and fish feed already offer a strong path to profitability, even without the human market.\n\nMicroHarvest is now seeking Series B funding to open a new plant in 2027, with a planned capacity of 15,000 tonnes of product per year — 40 times its current output.\n\nBekers is tight-lipped on the location, but her fellow co-founder, Luísa Cruz, was eager to point out the benefits of doing business in her native Portugal.\n\n“If you want to operate a biotechnology company, Portugal is a great place to do it,” says Cruz, who earned her PhD in biotechnology at TU Delft in the Netherlands.\n\n“It has great universities for biotechnology and a lot of talent, which is why we decided to open our first plant here.”\n\nBacked by record private investment and fresh EU funding, fermentation-based proteins like MicroHarvest’s are bubbling with promise. But turning dead bacteria from pet snacks into mainstream meals won’t be easy.\n\nThe next few years will reveal if these microbial powders are a fleeting fad or the future of food. I’m sure cows will be silently betting on the latter outcome.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"regulatory\", \"bacteria\", \"turning\", \"bekers\", \"dog\", \"startups\", \"proteins\", \"consumption\", \"lisbon\", \"human\", \"dead\", \"microbes\", \"treats\", \"food\", \"microbial\", \"snacks\", \"protein\", \"lab\"]", "content_hash": "76fc56c6a0eda5daa039b0d88e8723b439cdd221f1c1df05ad8a73bc9b36c2d4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:50.858668+00:00"}

Regulatory bodies need to keep up by rolling out tighter regulations aimed at strengthening consumer protections and stabilising the market.\n\nAs EU lawmakers scramble to protect consumers, others worry they are smothering growth. Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty. The regulatory bodies are defending the public, but had restrictions been lighter, would HSBC have had more creative solutions for its customers, such as embedding personalised, data-first lending?\n\nBanks have been fearful of exploring innovative embedded lending solutions, as they were 15% more likely to receive formal enforcement action. However, in August 2024, HSBC decided the benefits were worth the compliance battle.\n\nWhile some argue that regulation can hinder innovation — with companies hesitant to invest in operations due to increased oversight — others state that additional regulation will increase innovation and, with that, see regulation as a key driver of their growth. So, who’s right?\n\nBreaking down the recent EU fintech regulations\n\nRecently, a few new regulations came into effect in the EU that have majorly impacted fintechs.\n\nDORA, implemented in January 2025, requires EU-established financial institutions (FIs) to implement processes and structures to help them respond to and recover from ICT-related disruption, providing them with extra digital resilience. Additionally, the AMLA is being introduced to give governments more assurance in combatting money laundering.\n\nDORA and the AMLA will apply to all FIs and their products and processes, but leave crypto outside their scope. That’s where MiCA comes in. Rolled out in December 2024, MiCA was drafted to protect individual crypto users.\n\nThe EU’s regulatory agenda — especially with the introduction of MiCA, DORA, and AMLA — is about tightening oversight. However, it is also part of a broader strategy to simplify and harmonise regulations, providing stability to the EU financial markets as a whole. The latest rulings strike a delicate balance between reassuring consumers and regulators, and easing the burden on regulated FIs.\n\nA new set of regulations may seem contradictory to the so-called Competitiveness Compass — published in January by the European Commission — which includes initiatives on simplifying and effectively implementing EU law. Nevertheless, these laws aim to replace fragmented national rules with unified EU-wide frameworks, making compliance clearer, faster, and more predictable.\n\nAs the digital finance ecosystem continues to accelerate, MiCA, DORA, and AMLA form a comprehensive framework. Collectively, they aim to balance innovation with financial stability, consumer protection, and security throughout the fintech sector.\n\nWill these updates support or slow innovation in fintech and banking?\n\nThis answer depends on the perspective. Recent EU regulations may slow innovation in the short term, particularly for the larger and well-established FIs like banks, but the future outlook looks more fruitful. These new rules are designed to support long-term stability.\n\nAs these three regulations require full harmonisation across the member states, they’re designed to reduce fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. A bigger and more uniform market will encourage cross-border activities, innovation, and competitiveness between fintechs and related service providers. The regulations also support the creation of better, more transparent products and services, helping to increase consumer and regulator trust, ultimately boosting customer adoption.\n\nIn short, this environment will offer greater opportunities for smaller and more agile fintechs to scale and compete long-term. For consumers and businesses, acting on the latest regulations results in more reliable and resilient services, which are much needed for essential functions like digital payments and lending.\n\nThese new regulations level the playing field, encouraging traditional banks and fintechs to compete on innovation and service quality rather than only on regulatory strengths. Moreover, a stable and secure financial system boosts the EU’s attractiveness as a hub for digital financial services, which will help make the union more attractive to new investors and innovations than the US.\n\nWhat investments will be required to meet these new standards?\n\nAdditional investment in governance and compliance structures is needed. Bigger, more well-established players may struggle to implement the required regulatory changes in their extensive processes and products. Those with existing compliance and governance processes will likely find the transition more seamless, while smaller fintechs may need to build these from scratch. The costs of their implementation present a potential hurdle.\n\nNavigating compliance is often a significant challenge for fintech startups and other smaller players. They’ll need to invest in knowledge, including how to correctly implement regulatory requirements into their processes and product designs, and translate these into operational business processes.\n\nOn top of this, investments in technology will need to be made as businesses must meet customer-facing requirements around transparency and language. For example, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will demand changes in know your customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring tools.\n\nHowever, compliance with the DORA regulatory framework is what will entail the biggest investment in technology, since digital operational resilience requires more robust security, backup, and testing methods. When working with partners who are fluent in compliance, the long-term payoff is clear.\n\nThe new finance model: Legacy institutions meet agile innovators\n\nNew technology has changed the way people interact with financial services, driving the growth of fintechs and increasing rivalry with established banks. One report found that 36% of 18-24-year-olds would choose fintech platforms over conventional financial institutions. Built on modern tech stacks and lean teams, fintechs’ agility allows them to react fast to changing consumer needs and market trends — a sharp contrast to the legacy infrastructure slowing down traditional banks.\n\nHowever, for both the old and new factions to succeed in Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape, traditional institutions and digital-native disruptors will need to depend on alliances. Effective partnerships between fintechs, banks, and FIs under the new EU regulations will be based on a mutual effort to enhance compliance, embrace innovation, and strengthen operational resilience. These collaborations are key for navigating complex regulations while delivering secure, innovative financial services.\n\nFintechs, FIs, customers, and merchants can also all benefit from Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships. For example, in the case of embedded lending, banks that partner with technology providers can scale quickly into new revenue opportunities, reaching new and existing customers outside of the direct scope of the bank, and thus try to keep pace with fintech competitors, without building their own technology in-house.\n\nIn fact, 41% of FIs have already implemented embedded finance solutions, and close to 50% have expanded their BaaS capabilities. Merchant customers then gain convenient, safe access to regulated, secure, innovative financial products from a trusted bank.\n\nAnother way that banks and fintechs can increase innovation while ensuring compliance is by engaging in collaborative models, including participation in regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments can support testing of new financial products and services under the supervision of regulators, providing a balance between innovation and regulatory compliance.\n\nThe EU’s new wave of financial regulations isn’t just about tightening control — It’s part of a bigger push to simplify and unify rules across Europe. By uniforming patchwork national laws with consistent, EU-wide standards, compliance is now simpler to follow and predict. This uniformity and predictability can help encourage innovation while keeping consumer protection and financial stability front and centre. As fintech and banks collaborate, the future of digital finance in Europe is on track to be more open, safe, reliable, and inclusive.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"regulatory\", \"banks\", \"regulate\", \"regulations\", \"fintechs\", \"way\", \"opinion\", \"europe\", \"compliance\", \"financial\", \"future\", \"eu\", \"digital\", \"innovation\", \"fintech\", \"better\"]", "content_hash": "82915dce672f569d8b8d15c2f708b1453be1e0bcd65964d3688094326009eb6c", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:51.533104+00:00"}

You’ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected — and sometimes disrespectful — judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?\n\nA pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and I’ve spent a decade doing casting for “Shark Tank” and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.\n\nI hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest — won by Dutch startup Tap Electric — captured what can make a founder’s story stand out. Whether you’re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:\n\nNerves\n\nYes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn’t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something — before, during, and after.\n\nEntrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.\n\nResearch\n\nA successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges’ backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can “do the most” with the funding or resources provided.\n\nDon’t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business\n\nWhatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.\n\nStart by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.\n\nLastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.\n\nWhat do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?\n\nAudience\n\nConnect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.\n\nInvite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links — all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.\n\nInternalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you’re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection – eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel — makes your message resonate.\n\nAsk\n\nYou would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.\n\nDon’t leave the most important part as a surprise — always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.\n\nIf the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.\n\nAs is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.\n\nContent\n\nA good pitch isn’t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.\n\nTreat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!\n\nRecord your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence “elevator pitch” and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.\n\nWrite a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience — what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained.

As sunshine bathes the leafy university campus, scientists inside the labs work under cool fluorescent light. Clad in green protective gear, they tend meticulously to test tubes within hermetically sealed cleanrooms. The containers hold the fruits of today’s labour: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).\n\nEach cell is barely a quarter the width of a human hair but wields remarkable power. MSCs reduce inflammation, repair damaged tissue, and modulate the immune system. They can treat chronic diseases and delay ageing. They may even prevent illness before it begins. But to become a mainstay of modern healthcare, MSCs must be produced at scale, affordably and reliably.\n\nThat seemed a distant prospect until recently, but the Karolinska scientists believe it’s approaching reality. They’re working for Cellcolabs, a Swedish startup formed to tackle the global scarcity of stem cell treatments.\n\nCellcolabs believes this shortage could soon be overcome. Thanks to a blend of scientific, regulatory, and technological advances, MSCs are edging towards the consumer market. Within the next decade, Cellcolabs aims to cut prices by up to 90%.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

The latest harvest — cultivated from a single donation — has yielded 4.1 billion cells, enough for up to 200 standard doses.\n\nCellcolabs CEO Dr Mattias Bernow is in a buoyant mood. The 43-year-old sees today’s cultivation as just a taste of what’s to come.\n\n“I truly believe that we’re at an inflection point in the history of medicine,” he says.\n\nThe power of MSCs\n\nMSCs exist naturally in the body. A typical human contains billions of them. They act like a repair crew, fixing and tuning our insides. They can also be extracted, multiplied, and turned into medical treatments.\n\nKarolinska was the site of one of the field’s biggest milestones. In 2012, its Nobel Assembly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka. They discovered that mature cells can be made pluripotent — able to become almost any cell type in the body. The breakthrough rewrote the rules of regenerative medicine, igniting fresh regulatory momentum and fast-tracking stem cell therapies.\n\nMSCs are among the most promising examples. When injected, they release signals that trigger healing. The body then repairs itself.\n\nThey can treat countless conditions, from arthritis and heart disease to immune disorders. But first, you need to extract a small sample from a living, breathing human.\n\nCellcolabs sources its MSCs from the bone marrow of healthy donors aged 18 to 30. Just 50 millilitres — about a shot glass — produces up to 200 doses. The marrow naturally regenerates in six to eight weeks.\n\nThe donation process is quick and minimally invasive, but mass production is notoriously challenging. MSCs are living cells that require complex biomanufacturing, careful handling, and strict quality control, which makes scaling a formidable task.\n\nCellcolabs nonetheless sees industrial-scale production on the horizon — largely thanks to the pioneering research of Professor Katarina Le Blanc.\n\nLe Blanc’s landmark work showed MSCs could combat inflammatory and immune diseases. Her findings also proved that donated cells were suitable for therapeutic use — a crucial step for commercialisation.\n\nShe helped establish clinical-grade production standards, paving the way for large-scale trials and broader therapeutic use. Her research laid the foundations for Bernow’s inflection point.\n\n“This is not brain surgery or rocket science, but it is stem cells — so it’s quite close,” he says. “It’s super complex. And the only reason we can do this and move so fast is Professor Le Blanc’s research.”\n\nAs a haematologist, Le Blanc explored the potential of MSCs to support blood cancer patients. Her early clinical work focused on graft-versus-host disease — a severe and often fatal complication of bone marrow transplants. In a small trial, her team administered MSCs to patients who hadn’t responded to standard therapies. The impact was striking: more than half the participants survived. “The entire field just blew up,” says Bernow.\n\nLe Blanc continued pushing into new territory. One trial repaired vocal folds, restoring speech with minimal scarring. Another study used MSCs in COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation. The results were promising — but she hit a wall. “She ran out of cells,” Bernow says.\n\nScaling became a new focus. To expand treatment access, To expand treatment access, Le Blanc donated her research to Cellcolabs in 2021. Two years later, the Karolinska facility received production approval.\n\nProduction costs have fallen rapidly since then, fuelling hopes of a tenfold reduction. As prices drop and output scales, Bernow has his eyes on a target: “to truly democratise access to stem cells.”\n\nAfter spells as an ER physician, a consultant, and a startup founder, Mattias Bernow joined Cellcolabs in 2021. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nA new world of treatments\n\nBack in the lab, CPO Lina Sörvik leads a tour of the facilities. Previously a senior figure in big pharma, she joined Cellcolabs after being captivated by the potential of MSCs.\n\n“I was inspired by what they could do and by the idea of setting up a facility to produce them,” she says.\n\nOn a harvest day, her team’s work begins at 7:00 AM. Scientists don full protective gear and spend the day working inside the Karolinska cleanrooms. Once they’ve harvested the MSCs, the cells are tested for quality and frozen for future use.\n\nThe range of their applications is extensive. Middle-aged patients can gain relief from joint pain and injuries. Athletes can accelerate their recovery from injuries. The elderly could slow their ageing.\n\nBrian Johnson, a tech entrepreneur and celebrity longevity advocate, has also explored their powers. He had 300 million MSCs produced by Cellcolabs injected into his knees, shoulders, and hips.\n\nBernow lauds the variety of treatments. He says MSCs are interesting “for almost any indication.”\n\nHis path to them was winding. Raised in Malmö, southwestern Sweden, Bernow moved to the country’s capital to study at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE).\n\n“At that time, everybody wanted to become bankers in London,” he recalls. “That was not the future I saw for myself.”\n\nHe expanded his studies, earning a medical degree from Karolinska Institute and an MSc from SSE. After working as a clinical physician and management consultant, he co-founded Doctrin, a digital healthcare platform. Then Cellcolabs came calling: the leadership team needed a CEO and saw Bernow as a perfect fit.\n\n“I knew it was going to be more blood, sweat, and tears,” he says. “But the more I read, the more fascinated I became.”\n\nWhat fascinated him the most was the potential of MSCs to treat chronic conditions — the leading cause of death in the world. “That is why I think we’re truly at an inflection point in the history of medicine.”\n\nThe new antibiotics?\n\nBernow likes to share a quote from Joseph Martin, former Dean of Harvard Medical School: “Stem cell therapies have the potential to do for chronic diseases what antibiotics did for infectious diseases.”\n\nIt’s a bold comparison. Before Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, minor infections could be fatal. Healthy people died young or quickly aged.\n\nA century later, antibiotics let us live longer, better lives. Infectious diseases are no longer the leading causes of death. They’ve been supplanted by chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes. We’re also now living with more age-related illnesses, which severely reduce quality of life.\n\nMSCs, Bernow says, can help alleviate the growing burden of chronic illness. “But as a physician, what I find most interesting is the potential to prevent — or at least delay — the onset of disease.”\n\nHe recalls his time working in the ER, treating cardiac patients. A typical case was a middle-aged man who had just suffered his first cardiac event, now resigned to a lower quality and potentially shorter life. MSCs could have transformed that outcome.\n\nTheir regenerative and anti-inflammatory powers could support recovery — or even prevent the event altogether.\n\nTo reach this potential, Cellcolabs is targeting a new launchpad for scale: bioreactors.\n\nScaling for the future\n\nInside the Karolinska cleanrooms, Cellcolabs currently grows MSCs on flat surfaces in cell medium. Bioreactors offer a promising upgrade.\n\nBy vastly expanding cultivation surfaces and enabling automated, tightly controlled growth conditions, they could scale production far beyond what’s feasible with today’s methods.\n\nBioreactors could replace many of the manual methods currently used inside the cleanrooms. Credit: Cellcolabs\n\nCellcolabs is developing its bioreactor platform with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Bernow expects it to transform production, multiplying MSC output many times over.\n\nFull-scale launch is slated for 2028. By then, Cellcolabs also hopes to have compelling new evidence for the benefits of MSCs.\n\nThe startup is currently involved in promising tests in the Bahamas and Abu Dhabi. Both locations have created progressive, patient-friendly, and ethically regulated frameworks for MSC trials, which have made them industry trailblazers.\n\nAcross their test sites, scientists are investigating treatments for a variety of conditions: musculoskeletal injuries, knee osteoarthritis, cardiovascular risk, arthritis, and age-related frailty.\n\nIn smaller territories such as these, it’s easier to update medical regulations for emerging therapies. If they’re successful, Bernow expects other nations to follow their lead and accelerate their support for MSCs. The potential benefits, he argues, are enormous.\n\nHe envisions the tiny cells shifting healthcare systems from reactive to preventative, cutting costs while tackling chronic conditions. Our lives wouldn’t just grow longer — they’d be healthier and happier.\n\nBernow draws a contrast with recent advances in Western medicine. We live longer, but our later years are often marred by frailty, illness, and a confined existence.\n\n“We’ve added years with lower life quality,” he says. “If stem cells can delay chronic disease onset, we can start prolonging our healthy lifespan.”\n\nThat doesn’t mean, he adds, that MSCs will create a fountain of youth. They won’t expand our lives forever, but they dramatically improve the time we have.\n\n“I want to spend the first 100 years being highly active and with my family — with my children, my grandchildren, and maybe even my great great grandchildren.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"proclaims\", \"mscs\", \"production\", \"cells\", \"bernow\", \"cell\", \"startup\", \"cellcolabs\", \"nears\", \"potential\", \"chronic\", \"point\", \"mass\", \"conditions\", \"inflection\", \"karolinska\", \"stem\", \"medicine\"]", "content_hash": "dd2308db432021a3bafbae98355a42723558f3b60fb80576193317aa296684bc", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:53.916871+00:00"}

Or seismic activity sensors built for construction that go on to detect submarines underwater. These ideas represent the promise of dual-use technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes. For the first time, the European Commission is explicitly proposing to fund them through programmes such as Horizon Europe. But as we race to embrace dual-use technologies, we face a pivotal choice: continue the old model where military applications drive innovation that civilians later adopt, or turn this paradigm on its head?\n\nTechnological innovation has long followed a well-trodden path: the military drives development, with civilian applications emerging as an afterthought. Consider GPS, arguably one of the most successful dual-use technologies in history. Originally developed by the US Department of Defence in the 1970s, it was designed for military positioning and navigation. Civilian access was restricted by “Selective Availability” — a feature that intentionally degraded accuracy to preserve the military’s advantage.\n\nThe full potential of GPS remained unrealised for decades until the deactivation of Selective Availability in 2000, instantly making it 10 times more accurate for civilian users. It quickly became a technology that most of us rely on every day, sparking innovations that transformed industries from agriculture to transportation. A 2019 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that GPS had generated $1.4 trillion in economic benefits.\n\nThis military-first approach, as we’ve seen with GPS, has dominated innovation funding for decades. Yet there’s compelling evidence that civilian-first approaches to dual-use technologies both better serve society’s immediate needs and ultimately produce more robust solutions for all applications — including military ones.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nThe traditional model overlooks a critical reality: civilian markets provide both scale and diversity of applications that drive innovation in ways the more specialised military sector cannot match. This pattern repeats across technological domains. Internet protocols developed for military communications found their greatest evolution in civilian applications, before returning to enhance military systems. The commercial drone industry has accelerated aerial innovation far beyond what military procurement alone could achieve.\n\nBy focusing on civilian-first use cases, innovation can leverage larger markets, more diverse applications, and faster development cycles. When technologies are developed with broad civilian applications in mind, they benefit from economies of scale that military-only development cannot achieve.\n\nThis is in part because civilian innovation faces fewer bureaucratic constraints. Military procurement cycles can span years or even decades, while civilian markets reward agility and rapid iteration. Developing for civilian use first allows technologies to evolve and mature faster than would be possible under traditional defence procurement timelines.\n\nThe most promising dual-use breakthroughs come from tackling fundamental technical challenges rather than specific operational functions. When innovators focus narrowly on military operations, they often miss the broader potential of their technologies. Scientific potential isn’t abstract; it only becomes real through implementation.\n\nThe challenge of developing robust navigation systems that work without GPS is a perfect example. A solution that enables delivery drones to navigate urban environments reliably could revolutionise logistics while simultaneously providing capabilities critical for defence operations. By emphasising civilian applications while acknowledging potential military uses, we create space for innovations that might otherwise never emerge.\n\nResearch from the European Commission on introducing a military tech aspect to the successor to Horizon Europe found that academic and research institutions would prefer to stick to the status quo, and keep Europe’s R&D funding solely for civilian technologies. By providing funding pathways that respect these preferences, we expand the talent pool, addressing critical technological challenges. Given the financial strains and political pressures in US higher education, Europe could attract top innovators from across the Atlantic by creating an environment aligned with their core values.\n\nAs Europe intensifies its focus on strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty, dual-use technologies will play an increasingly important role. The EU’s recent moves to allow dual-use funding through programs such as Horizon Europe represent an important shift in how we approach innovation. But as these initiatives take shape, they must avoid simply replicating the traditional military-first model.\n\nBy prioritising civilian use cases while acknowledging military applications, we can leverage market forces, attract diverse talent, and produce more robust technologies for all applications.\n\nYet for dual-use development to be truly durable, civilian and military technologies must no longer be siloed – we have to bridge the gap between civilian first R&D and military use cases. Given the chasm that exists between the way these two sectors operate, this will need to be an active process. Initiating more open knowledge exchange would better apply insights and learnings from both worlds back and forth. For bodies that focus on military technology, it is time to incubate a civilian equivalent. Conversely, organisations like mine — SPRIND, the German federal agency for disruptive innovation — focused on civilian technology, should also explore military applications.\n\nThe challenges we face — from climate change and energy security to supply chain resilience — require technological solutions that serve multiple purposes. The old dichotomy between civilian and military innovation is increasingly outdated in a world where the most powerful technologies inevitably serve both domains. The transformative dual-use technologies of tomorrow are closer than we think — if we focus on civilian use cases today.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"civilian\", \"drive\", \"military\", \"gps\", \"technologies\", \"applications\", \"europe\", \"technology\", \"dualuse\", \"civilianfirst\", \"technological\", \"innovation\", \"better\"]", "content_hash": "bc2e88a4cc848f0500cccd40b738d661283722c1c7b4c93b31bfd2d57a448d36", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:54.594759+00:00"}

But he’s begun to wonder if candidates’ answers are genuine, even on video calls. “I can see their eyes shifting across the screen,” he says. “Then they come back with the perfect answer to a question.” The trust gap between employer and jobseeker is widening, and it’s fast becoming one of the trickiest knots in modern hiring.\n\n\n\nFrom ChatGPT-polished CVs to full-blown applications submitted by bots, GenAI has hit the job market hard and gone fully mainstream. For a sizable generation of jobseekers — 68% of European tech workers were actively looking for a new role at the end of 2024 — it’s commonplace to use AI to tweak a CV or even complete an entire application.\n\n\n\nTools like Sonara, LazyApply, and JobCopilot have made it easy to shoot off dozens of applications in a day. In June, data from TestGorilla found that just over a third (37%) of UK jobseekers are using AI to complete applications. Among early-career candidates, it jumps to 60%, up from 38% the year before, according to Bright Network, which connects graduates and young professionals with recruiters.\n\nStartups are at the forefront of this AI arms race. With smaller teams, shorter runways, and a culture of speed, they’re particularly exposed to this strange new world of suspiciously shiny applicants and AI-assisted code challenges. Most aren’t fighting it: 85% of employers now actively accept AI-assisted applications. But their acceptance doesn’t equal apathy. Amid a deluge of blatant AI use, how are Europe’s most agile companies working out who’s being real — and if they’re worth bringing onboard?\n\nA new normal\n\nUsing AI to troubleshoot and tailor a CV has become par for the course. For most jobseekers, GenAI acts like a digital sidekick — smoothing grammar, sharpening phrasing, and cranking out tailored applications faster than ever. According to Canva’s January survey of 5,000 employees across countries including the UK, France, Spain, and Germany, 45% had used GenAI to build or improve a resume — and have yielded positive results. But hiring managers aren’t entirely sold. In the UK, 63% believe candidates should disclose if AI played a role in their application materials, signifying that trust is on shaky ground.\n\nOther research suggests that attitudes depend on the context. A global survey by Experis (part of workforce giant ManpowerGroup) found that 28% of tech leaders are fine with AI if used to personalise a resume or cover letter, 26% with help on problem-solving tests, and 24% even with answering interview questions. Just 15% said AI use is unacceptable across the entire job application process.\n\nFor Duco van Lanschot, co-founder of fintech startup Duna, it’s all about the role. “If an engineer used ChatGPT to polish a written application, fine. That’s not the job. But for a growth or sales hire to use it very obviously is a big red flag,” he says. “The job itself involves public-facing comms and emailing stakeholders — and in a sea of generic, AI-generated copy, I want us to be as human as possible.”\n\nTech employers and startups are adapting — albeit in different ways and at different speeds. Some are setting ground rules for usage, some are bulking out human-only processes, and some are cutting away entire parts of the “traditional” hiring approach. “AI hasn’t broken hiring,” says Marija Marcenko, Head of Global Talent Acquisition at SaaS platform Semrush. “But it’s changed how we engage with candidates.”\n\nGoodbye to CVs\n\nIn the words of Khyati Sundaram, ethical AI hiring expert and CEO of Applied, we’re in the middle of “an AI-on-AI war.” And in the fallout, traditional application materials are losing their sway. In the tech sector, cover letters fell into obsolescence long ago, and CVs are next on the chopping block. “A huge upside is that it’s exposing résumés for what they are — a broken artefact,” says Sundaram, whose team works with the likes of Unicef UK, BLab, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. “Putting résumés into keyword scanners or GenAI tools isn’t solving the problem for those hiring, because when it comes to the interview, the candidate falls apart,” she explains.\n\nInstead of cover letters and cut-and-paste CVs, employers are turning to structured questionnaires and skill-based tasks — tools that measure how someone thinks, not just how well they can write a prompt. “Skill-based hiring is no longer just a tech hiring thing,” Sundaram adds. “We’re seeing that crop up in more white-collar roles across the board.” According to TestGorilla, 77% of UK employers now use skills tests to evaluate candidates, with the same proportion saying these tests outperform CVs in predicting job success. This should have a positive effect in the long term: LinkedIn’s Economic Graph Institute found that a skills-based approach globally could expand talent pools by 6.1x, and help broaden gender and minority representation.\n\nAt Semrush, the shakeup is already in full swing. Hiring managers are trained to sniff out fluency without depth, spotting signs of AI in real-time coding challenges or task-based interviews. “We’ve replaced the usual ‘Tell me about yourself’ prompts with in-depth interviews that explore experience, soft skills, and thinking patterns,” says Marcenko. “It’s hard to fake those, with or without AI.”\n\n\n\nApplied’s own system uses a mix of automation and human insight. “We don’t believe in AI detectors — they’re rarely accurate, so we train reviewers to pattern match like an AI, comparing submissions to known GPT outputs,” explains Sundaram. “If five responses sound suspiciously identical, humans can flag them.”\n\nElsewhere, startups are getting more creative and more human. Alessandro Bonati, Chief People Officer at travel scaleup WeRoad, has ditched cover letters in favour of more creative, human-centric formats like curated portfolios or briefs of the “show, don’t tell” type. The company, which has over 210 staff in offices across Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, actively encourages candidates to use AI. “But that’s also accompanied by traditional in-person interviews to assess candidates’ thinking, communication, and cultural fit in real time,” says Bonati. His team also leans on real-time scenario-based exercises that reflect how candidates would collaborate, not just how well they can prepare.\n\nThe return of the reference and in-person interviews\n\nAnother ripple effect: references are back on the menu. Santiago Nestares, co-founder of the accounting startup DualEntry, is spending more time face-to-face on Zoom with candidates. “Experience is hard to fake,” says Nestares. “You can usually tell when someone’s just read about something versus having lived it.” He’s also going deeper on references; not just the usual ones, as those are always glowing, but backchannel conversations with people who’ve worked with them directly. “It’s so we can find out how someone handles pressure, works with a team, and shows up day to day,” says Nestares.\n\nThrough building the team for Connectd, a platform which enables angel investors and founders to effectively manage their startups, Samuel has noticed that candidates are cutting through the lack of trust by building more social proof around themselves. “For hiring managers, instead of taking a candidate’s word for it, we’re diving into references more than ever,” he says.\n\nThe dreaded take-home task is on the way out now too. Unpaid and time-consuming, candidates have long despised them, and now that there’s the option of using GenAI to fake it (until they make it), employers are souring on them too. Live interviews, technical walk-throughs, scenario-based challenges, and even roleplay simulations are becoming the new standard, particularly in product, design, and marketing roles. “AI detectors are being used,” says Andreas Bundi, founder of Berlin-based HR consultancy Bundls. “But most companies are asking — why bother with take-homes when you can just do a live assessment?”\n\n\n\nBundi, who works with clients like Pitch, Cradle and Telli, says hybrid companies with mandatory office days are ditching take-homes to keep the interview process aligned with on-site work. With more candidates on the market, jobseekers are going further — relocating, or even flying in for interviews.\n\n\n\nIn the same vein, well-funded companies are increasingly comfortable bringing people on-site for tasks. “When travel isn’t possible, I’ve arranged in-person meetings with interviewers who happen to be nearby,” says Bundi. “I recently scheduled interviews around a conference both the candidate and interviewer were attending.” This “networking meets hiring approach” works surprisingly well.\n\nBundi says he sees that it’s the AI-first companies that are more relaxed about candidates using tools like ChatGPT — but it’s rarely made explicit. Recently, one of his Lead Data Scientists blew an interview by manually wrangling messy data instead of automating it. “They thought they needed to demonstrate their raw coding skills,” says Bundi. “But the company wanted strategy, not a human data janitor. That’s what ChatGPT is for.” As AI becomes standard, candidates and companies will need to get clearer on where it fits in the process. Until then, these frictions will continue.\n\nHire for skills and values, not a job description\n\nDespite the ubiquity of AI-powered applications, most companies still haven’t formalised their approach. “It’s confusing for candidates, as some companies don’t want AI used in applications, even though those same roles involve AI tools every day,” says Sundaram. Indeed, 40% of employers using BrightNetwork services said they still haven’t set guidelines for AI usage in their processes, although 28% plan to for the next recruitment season. Of those who have set guidelines, 44% don’t allow candidates to use AI.\n\n\n\n“The vanguard employers want everyone to use it and demonstrate their AI literacy,” says Sundaram. Some of Applied’s clients have even added the question: ‘How will you use AI in this job?’ She warns, however, that many of the quick fixes employers reach for — AI detectors, video screening with facial tracking, voice sentiment tools — raise huge ethical concerns. “If companies are tracking facial expressions for emotional nuance, it gets creepy,” she says. “Where do we draw the line?”\n\n\n\nInstead, she argues, the fix will lie in redefining what candidates are being tested for. Applied has shifted from traditional job architecture to task architecture, evaluating not just skills, but values like resilience, adaptability, and mission alignment. “These are the human traits that will matter even more as jobs evolve,” she says. “Especially in startups, where everyone’s a generalist.”\n\nWithout doubt, generative AI is fundamentally reshaping the hiring process. The most forward-looking startups aren’t resisting the change — they’re building better processes around it. CVs may be broken, cover letters outdated, and applications increasingly synthetic — but the real differentiator is still very human. “We need people who can adapt, not just apply,” says Sundaram. “Because the job they’re hired for today may not exist in six months.” Startups that understand this and structure their hiring accordingly aren’t just future-proofing their teams, they’re rewriting the rules of work for the AI era.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"hiring\", \"applications\", \"sundaram\", \"theyre\", \"rewriting\", \"job\", \"recruitment\", \"war\", \"aionai\", \"candidates\", \"companies\", \"employers\", \"human\", \"ai\", \"playbook\"]", "content_hash": "11425f6547d5c5c3e3f4e81a0a8713526abf8ef114bd4c54fcdb65626b9beee6", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:56.374171+00:00"}

Then there is Asia — with China’s rapid developments and Japan and South Korea’s deep legacy in robotics. Headlines still gravitate toward billion-dollar budgets, rapid hardware iterations, and slick simulation reels.\n\nBehind the noise, though, another development is unfolding in Europe — quieter, but potentially far more consequential. The next chapter of humanoid robotics may be defined not by who moves first or builds the flashiest prototypes, but by who moves with the discipline and consistency required. And Europe has the potential to lead this new era.\n\nRegulation as strategy\n\nIn most conversations about innovation, regulation is framed as a brake. In Silicon Valley, it’s often seen as a hurdle to scale or a signal of bureaucratic overreach. But Europe — particularly in AI and robotics — is rewriting that narrative. With the AI Act now adopted, the EU is the first region to offer comprehensive legal clarity around the deployment of high-risk AI systems, including humanoid robots.\n\nWe must also consider that, eventually, other countries will likely adopt regulatory frameworks that align broadly with the EU’s, even if they’re less stringent. By designing with European standards from the outset, we’ll be well-positioned to adapt quickly as new regulations emerge elsewhere.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

In a field as complex and potentially disruptive as robotics, clear rules don’t slow down progress — they de-risk it.\n\nEurope has also introduced or updated several other regulations that directly impact robotics:\n\nThe Product Liability Directive now includes software and AI, reducing ambiguity and incentivising safer design practices.\n\nThe General Product Safety Regulation streamlines cross-border market entry with harmonised safety standards.\n\nThe Machinery Regulation defines clearer certification routes for robotic systems.\n\nTogether, these frameworks give the EU a coherent and predictable regulatory environment. Yes, it’s tough, but given the implications, this provides exactly what the humanoid sector needs: clarity.\n\nDeployment, not demos\n\nWhile the US often relies on innovation funded by Big Tech monopolies and China leans on state-driven manufacturing strategies, Europe’s robotics sector is built on modular collaboration. Startups and research labs spin out into well-funded clusters, often supported by EU-backed initiatives like RI4EU and EIC Accelerator. These programs offer access to testbeds, pilot funding, and collaborative R&D networks.\n\nFurthermore, Europe’s geographic and industrial structure gives it a special advantage: close proximity to real-world use cases. Having neighbouring logistics hubs, manufacturing zones, and retail chains in contiguity helps speed iteration and aligns development with the continent’s actual operational pain points. McKinsey estimates that in some of Europe’s critical sectors — including retail and logistics — payroll alone amounts to $1.7 trillion (€1.55 trillion). This makes automation highly profitable and ripe for disruption.\n\nThese factors have played a key role in the strategy of Humanoid, the robotics company I founded in the UK last year. Our goal isn’t just to impress on stage; it’s far more important that we seamlessly integrate innovations into real workflows. For this, we’ve adopted a simple, modular design philosophy: a wheeled base that suits logistics environments, accelerated by simulation plus feedback from real industry trials. We believe that hype must be based on reality — a mindset that’s drawing US investors to European robotics.\n\nThis shift is already reflected in funding dynamics. Neura Robotics’ €120mn funding round in January 2025 was one of the largest in European robotics to date. And investors are now betting on full-stack teams with credible deployment strategies — instead of merely speculative tech.\n\nHumanoid’s latest robot, HMND 01, was introduced in a video earlier this year. Credit: Humanoid\n\nA better fit for the future of work\n\nBeyond reducing uncertainty, European regulation also helps encode values that shape how humanoid robots are developed and deployed. The AI Act requires high-risk systems — including those used in workplaces, public spaces, and healthcare settings — to meet strict safety, transparency, and human oversight standards.\n\nSuch a framework fosters trust, which is essential for robots operating in sensitive environments like factories, hospitals, or elderly care facilities. Europe’s emphasis on traceability and ethical co-development goes beyond mitigating risk — it creates the conditions for adoption at scale, where safety and dignity are non-negotiable.\n\nAdditionally, this approach helps position robots as partners. By designing for augmentation rather than displacement — as often seen in the US — European startups are modelling a more human-centred approach to automation. They’re also offering an alternative to the dominant narrative that robots will replace humans in critical roles.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that some jobs aren’t meant for people, as they hinder individuals from reaching their full potential. For instance, a humanoid could take over the task of moving boxes around a warehouse all day. This is not simply a replacement; it is an augmentation of existing automation capabilities, which empowers people to find more purpose-driven work.\n\nThat distinction comes into sharper focus when we look at the places where humanoids are most needed, such as logistics hubs, clinics, and care homes. These environments have real spatial and regulatory constraints and little room for error. The tasks there are repetitive but require precision, and people are extremely busy. In these settings, robots need to quietly support the flow of work, not interrupt it. That requires thoughtful integration, which means responding at the right pace, handling objects predictably, and, yes, staying out of the way when needed.\n\nThese are practical challenges shaped by day-to-day routines, not only engineering feats. And, from our vantage point, Europe’s cautious, user-informed development model is well-suited to meet them.\n\nSupply chains and strategic independence\n\nThere are still concerns in European robotics that need to be addressed. As of 2025, China controls 63% of the humanoid hardware supply chain, from rare-earth magnets to key actuators. However, we’re now seeing global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) based in Europe partnering with humanoid creators early on to co-develop hardware components together. This strategy can mitigate the risk of over-dependence.\n\nOn the other hand, while the US dominates in AI software, few actors globally offer fully-integrated stacks. We see some moves in that direction in the US and China, and Europe — which is still dependent on imports — must learn to navigate this space assertively.\n\nCalls for supply diversification are growing. In June 2025, Benjamin Krieger, from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA), emphasised the need for stronger EU supply chain routes due to China’s export controls on rare-earth elements. In the US, analysts are sounding similar alarms.\n\nTo reduce dependency, Europe will need to support local manufacturing of key components, incentivise alternative sourcing, and form trade alliances outside Beijing’s orbit.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nThe next phase of humanoid robotics will not be won by whoever moves fastest. It will be won by whoever builds best.\n\nWhat will this require? To start, bolstering funding and support mechanisms that help innovations advance through the later stages of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale — and move from pilots to industrial-grade rollouts. Second, forging industrial partnerships that begin during prototyping, not after. Third, policy agility to fast-track certification while maintaining the highest safety standards.\n\nWhat’s at stake isn’t just who secures the most patents — we’ve already seen that happen without meaningful real-world deployment. The true challenge is whether we can build systems that integrate safely into human environments, uphold public trust, and address the real concerns people have — from privacy and transparency to everyday safety and interaction.\n\nEurope doesn’t need to mimic Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Instead, it needs to double down on what it already does well: interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical tech design, and industrial pragmatism.\n\nThe global humanoid race is not a sprint — it’s a long-term infrastructure project. And if we get it right, Europe could build the future’s most trusted workforce —- one that collaborates with humans and changes the world, one robot at a time.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"robotics\", \"win\", \"humanoid\", \"robots\", \"need\", \"quietly\", \"safety\", \"european\", \"europe\", \"race\", \"eu\", \"europes\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "8029ef43a1e99617e17b64c4dd64eba16fadbfd6d11ad701563f5949b3ab9754", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:57.061538+00:00"}

The Data Protection Act, the GDPR, and the recent AI Act — aligned more closely with local workers’ laws and unions — have set the continent on a separate path.\n\nA recent joint study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Poland’s National Research Institute (NASK) found that Europe — along with Asia — tops the list of most exposed regions to AI, far surpassing the Americas. With studies finding that one in four jobs are at risk of being transformed by AI globally, the impact in Europe — a region which faces a significant shortage of skilled workers — has become a pressing concern.\n\n“In many ways, it’s too early to tell where the AI wave will take us — we’ve only seen a fraction of its capabilities so far, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying,” Adam Maurer, COO at Connecting Software, a tech company operating across Europe, told TNW.\n\nIn recent years, Big Tech companies have frequently carried out mass layoffs, driven both by revenue concerns and the belief that AI can take over many of the functions of employees from entry to mid-level, Maurer said.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nSome of these AI-driven layoffs have effectively targeted low performers, but other initiatives have been problematic. At Klarna, for example, they had concerning impacts on the business.\n\nKlarna, a Swedish fintech company that fired 700 workers and replaced them with AI, recently announced it will hire humans back again. The company’s CEO admitted to having made a “mistake” when replacing workers with AI.\n\n“It’s very clear that AI will definitely replace some jobs,” Maurer said. “On the other side of the coin, I think it will make some other jobs far more valuable.”\n\nIn the EU, labour laws and regulations will shape the impact on jobs. Tech leaders believe they could lead to an AI future that benefits both workers and businesses.\n\nThe talk among executives\n\nMaurer said there may be some expectation for the EU to step in and regulate job displacement. However, he argued that would stagnate growth and discourage startups from doing business in the union.\n\nBut not every business leader agrees. Displacement will happen, but not because of AI, said Volodymyr Kubytskyi, head of AI at MacPaw, a Ukrainian software company developing solutions for Apple devices.\n\n“AI disrupts the traditional logic and processes of work,” Kubytskyi told TNW. “The real question is, ‘Can we redesign work processes before this outdated system collapses?’” To prevent the system from collapsing, leaders must stop thinking of AI as a quick-win or cost-saving tool, he said.\n\nKubytskyi argued that while the AI Act was necessary to set a baseline for the industry, it doesn’t account for potential job disruption, which is a gap in the regulatory landscape.\n\n“To account for this, the AI Act should be updated, but it’s unlikely that this will happen soon,” he said.\n\nRoman Eloshvili, founder of ComplyControl, a UK compliance company, told TNW that the AI Act targets safety, transparency, and ethics, but falls short on socio-economic impact, especially on jobs. “So, amendments are necessary,” he said.\n\n“I expect that, over time, some of them, such as mandates for employer-led upskilling or protections for displaced workers, will appear to address workforce implications more effectively.”\n\nWill the AI Act become outdated or even counterproductive, especially if its stringent compliance mechanisms amplify inequalities in access to AI benefits? Or is it too early in the game to amend the law?\n\nKris Jones, who leads the engineering team in Belfast for iVerify, believes it’s too soon to make changes. He said the AI Act’s risk-based framework already strikes a delicate balance between protecting fundamental rights and giving innovators room to breathe.\n\nAmending the regulation is not the only policy idea discussed among executives. Jones told TNW that member states have other levers to pull. “One idea floating around is an ‘AI token’ tax,” he said.\n\nA token tax would enable governments to generate revenue from AI usage that is producing income. These funds would then be redistributed through measures such as reskilling programs or support for affected industries.\n\nDario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, recently told Axios that the concept could offset the inevitable wipeout of millions of entry-level white-collar jobs lost to AI.\n\n“Measures like that can cushion any job shocks without putting a blanket lid on innovation,” Amodei said.\n\nAre clashes with European labour and trade unions inevitable?\n\nEuropean labour and trade union bodies have often been ignored in the debate over AI job displacement. But many of them have already made official statements expressing concerns over AI.\n\nAhead of the Paris AI Summit in February 2025, the ETUC, representing over 45 million European workers, issued an open letter about AI’s dangers. It warned that any efforts to ensure AI has “a positive impact on workers in the labour markets, quality jobs, and society will be annulled if AI is monopolised by a handful of tech companies”.\n\nThe previous August, UK unions, including Accord and Unite, had called for regulations to protect workers from AI. They also proposed reskilling programs for workers, reminded companies of their transparency obligations, and emphasised the need for union consultations. They said that they intended to protect workers’ rights against AI‑driven hiring and firing, as well as defend IP rights for creative professionals.\n\nWe asked tech firms whether they expect companies to face challenges with labour laws and unions in Europe.\n\n“Undoubtedly,” Eloshvili from ComplyControl said. “European robust worker protections and active unions present both a safeguard and challenges for AI integration.”\n\nUnions will demand transparency and worker involvement in AI deployment as automation threatens certain jobs, he said. “Firms that try to impose AI solutions without dialogue definitely risk conflict and backlash.”\n\nDespite the challenges, Eloshvili said it isn’t a zero-sum game. “When businesses and unions work together — for example, under joint upskilling initiatives — AI can become an effective tool for improving working conditions,” he said.\n\nKubytskyi from MacPaw agreed that challenges will arise on this front and described the pushback from unions and workers’ organisations as “understandable”.\n\n“Clarity, structure, and communication are vital,” he said. “If you integrate new [AI] agents into existing workflows without involving people, you’ll get pushback, and for a good reason.”\n\nKubytskyi also believes that conflict can be avoided. “To prevent this, we need to show people what AI does, what guardrails are in place, and why it will benefit the team.”\n\nJorge Riera, the CEO of big data and AI consultancy Dataco, agrees. “The most effective AI deployments are strategic,” he said, adding that careful analysis is needed to decipher which work tasks should be offloaded to AI.\n\nFlipping the script to develop AI the ‘European way’\n\nJones from iVerify explained that regulations, trade unions, and workers’ rights in Europe are not necessarily an obstacle and could, in fact, be beneficial.\n\nHe believes companies should embed responsible AI, bias checks, explainability, and human oversight loops into each product cycle. That way, they can transform the AI Act from a compliance hurdle into a market differentiator, Jones explained.\n\n“Europe can’t sit out the AI wave; the Bay Area now fields roughly half of the world’s unicorns and hoovers up 80% of GenAI funding, while much of the European workforce is ageing and a quarter of young Europeans can’t find work,” Jones said.\n\nEurope is not only facing competition from the usual suspects — Asia and the US — but also from Latin America, where heavy investment in technology is underway.\n\nMahesh Raja, chief growth officer of Ness Digital Engineering, which operates innovation centres in the UK and Czechia, highlighted how this lack of similar investment is hurting business. “Fifty-three percent of small- and medium-size businesses found the initial cost of AI implementation to be much higher than anticipated. We need to address the adoption challenges that stem from legacy IT infrastructures and improve the collective time-to-value for this emerging technology,” he said.\n\nHowever, Europe’s stringent regulations can become a premium brand for banks, healthtechs, and any sector that values trust and data privacy.\n\n”Europe shouldn’t just photocopy Silicon Valley,” Jones said. He believes the continent’s strengths lie in a combination of factors, including upskilling and STEM PhD graduates per capita. The privacy-first and safe AI leadership — solidified in regulation — can bolster the package.\n\n“Overall, Europe should push hard on AI augmentation and skill-building, or we’ll fall further behind,” Jones said. “But do it Europe’s way, leveraging our ethical governance, deep industrial know-how, and cross-border talent pipelines instead of importing the Valley’s blitz-and-break culture wholesale.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"act\", \"labour\", \"tech\", \"jobs\", \"workers\", \"protect\", \"eus\", \"europe\", \"unions\", \"stifling\", \"work\", \"innovation\", \"ai\", \"jones\"]", "content_hash": "6a915d591aedd1712007b208fc9ef8cb7cefbc70ed2031d0b79a9a08e7dee80f", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:57.743897+00:00"}

The reason for this is that traditional funding models cannot support the long-term financial commitments that innovation demands. There is a European paradox where, despite substantial scientific research, early commercialisation and a focus on shorter-term goals prevent the region from realising the full potential of deep tech. Although startups provide strong support, the sector still lags behind the US and Asia in bringing breakthroughs from the lab to market.\n\nTo maintain a competitive industry, Europe needs to advance technologies like AI, robotics, synthetic biology, and quantum computing, which are at the heart of the deep tech sector. These technologies aren’t just profitable. They can transform the world, from cochlear implants restoring hearing to aerospace engineering enabling missions to Mars. But none of these advances happen without patient, long-term investment in science, engineering, and design.\n\nStartups focused on rapid-deployment SaaS or consumer apps can commercialise quickly and attract early investment. Deep tech is different: there’s a “valley of death” driven by long R&D cycles, high upfront costs, and greater risk tolerance than in traditional software ventures.\n\nIt’s worth examining which new funding models are working — and how they are starting to take hold in Europe. Drawing on insights from my investment practice — Zubr Capital — this analysis explores the real opportunity for Europe to leverage deep tech and reclaim lost market share, rather than see its startups move to mature financial ecosystems like the US, Asia, or Israel.\n\nWhy classic VC struggles with deep tech\n\nTraditional software startups typically follow a familiar funding cycle blueprint. It raises a 10-year fund, deploys gained capital over three to five years, and aims for lucrative investment exits within five to seven years. The startup defines a successful funding cycle based on rapid growth, scalability, and relatively low capital requirements.\n\nDeep tech cannot operate within this traditional financial mould. Startups operating in this category need development cycles that often exceed a decade. Regulations from subcategories like healthcare, energy, and aerospace require numerous certifications and tests to verify advanced capabilities. That is an area where generalist VCs rarely tread due to a need for patient capital.\n\nMost deep tech companies have to overcome specific industrial and geographical thresholds. A French aerospace firm, for instance, may not have the infrastructure to take advantage of traditional funding the way a US giant like Delta can.\n\nEstablished investment models present several obstacles to deep tech companies. For example:\n\nPressure for visible traction pushes startups to pivot from deep tech to commercial projects.\n\nTraditional VCs often lack the expertise to evaluate complex projects properly.\n\nEurope has smaller funds for upfront and long-term costs.\n\nThere is a “valley of death” for deep tech to cover R&D from public funds.\n\nEU investors tend to be risk-averse due to the stigma of failure.\n\nFragmentation within the industry, with multiple markets, regulations, and heavy bureaucracy, slows funding.\n\nForeign funding steps in for late-stage rounds, frequently taking the tech to other countries.\n\nAnother pain point in deep tech is the reliance on education. A traditional startup leader only has two to three years of higher education. Deep tech requires about five to seven years due to the complexity of the subject matter. An overwhelming 81% of deep tech founders believe European investors lack the knowledge to really understand the in-depth details of their projects or goals.\n\nThere also simply isn’t enough money to offer. A European fund managing €150mn can write a few €10 to €15 mn checks, but that isn’t enough to build something as complex as a gigafactory or scale a new fusion plant. The mismatch of traditional VC funding with deep tech in Europe is what drives systemic underfunding, stalled startups, and the loss of world-changing innovations. There is a history of outside and foreign entities like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and others picking up European tech talent to integrate into their R&D sectors. Those losses slow European deep tech advancement.\n\nThe evidence: when VC fails deep tech\n\nThe idea of mismatched VCs isn’t theoretical. There are many real-world examples of funding failures leading to Europe losing deep tech opportunities to international competitors. Here are just a few examples.\n\nProphesee in France\n\nProphesee creates neuromorphic vision sensors that enable machines to mimic human sight. The company raised €126mn over several rounds. However, in October of 2024, Prophesee entered judicial recovery after failing to secure additional funding. Even though the startup received massive global recognition for its technical validation (proof of concept), the length and uncertainty of financing led to complications in development.\n\nMycorena in Sweden\n\nMycorena had to file for bankruptcy and is now permanently closed. What began with the promise of mycelium-based protein that could be used in all kinds of industries failed after the startup couldn’t secure Series B funding in the mid-2020s. Mycorena was ultimately acquired for next to nothing, underscoring the hurdles deep tech companies encounter during scale-up.\n\nBlickfeld in Germany\n\nBlickfeld was an emerging leader in LiDAR, which enables autonomous vehicles to perceive their environment and operate safely. The company raised a total of €68mn — including €15mn from the European Investment Bank (EIB). But in June 2024, Blickfeld had to file for insolvency. Revenue came in too slowly to meet the demands of patient capital.\n\nThere are many other examples of investment shortcomings undermining promising European tech firms. Take MaaS Global in Finland, best known for the Whim app, which burned through too much capital without a sustainable business model. Or Sweden’s Northvolt, whose battery manufacturing business failed even with a blended funding model.\n\nThe pattern is strikingly consistent: funding dries up when capital needs spike and investors push for exits while R&D is still trying to work out the final solution. Meanwhile, public funding fails to arrive in time, and technical ambition is quickly sacrificed on the altar of short-term vitality. History is repeating itself, and deep tech is losing out.\n\nNorthvolt’s gigafactory in Sweden ceased production after the company’s bankruptcy. Credit: Northvolt\n\nWhat’s emerging instead: new investment models\n\nFor Europe to capitalise on deep tech, change must happen — and happen fast. New funding models and structures are required to meet the sector’s needs. Alternative solutions could be the final leg of the journey to overcome issues like the “valley of death” for deep tech. Which funding initiatives will get us there?\n\nGovernment-backed & hybrid schemes. We need to replicate the EIC’s investment strategy of grants, equity, and hybrid investments. The EIC Accelerators, for example, offer up to €17.5mn per company, and the new STEP Scale-up Scheme targets growth rounds of €10-30 million. Government-backed funds, such as Bpifrance and the German Zukunftsfonds, meanwhile, can help de-risk early innovation and fill funding gaps for deep tech.\n\nWe need to replicate the EIC’s investment strategy of grants, equity, and hybrid investments.

Government-backed funds, such as Bpifrance and the German Zukunftsfonds, meanwhile, can help de-risk early innovation and fill funding gaps for deep tech. Public-private partnerships. Pooling resources is an important way to fund deep tech. When state, corporate, and private investors work together, they naturally expand the usable timeline of a development group, boosting financial support for proofs of concept and market launches.\n\nPooling resources is an important way to fund deep tech. When state, corporate, and private investors work together, they naturally expand the usable timeline of a development group, boosting financial support for proofs of concept and market launches. Corporate Venture Capital (CVC). The strategic investment arms of companies like Volkswagen, Airbus, Siemens, and Bosch help fund deep tech. Not only do they offer financial support, but they also tend to have technical expertise and access to advanced equipment that can bring the technology to life. Lilium is a good example. The German eVTOL startup secured funding from grants and private players, having received €200mn from the Mobile Uplift Consortium.\n\nThe strategic investment arms of companies like Volkswagen, Airbus, Siemens, and Bosch help fund deep tech.

Private wealth has also entered the deep tech space. Family offices like Strüngmann Brothers (BioNTech) can back companies from inception to scale. These entities are less constrained by traditional fund structures, allowing greater investment impact with stronger strategic alignment for the long term.\n\nPrivate wealth has also entered the deep tech space. Family offices like Strüngmann Brothers (BioNTech) can back companies from inception to scale. These entities are less constrained by traditional fund structures, allowing greater investment impact with stronger strategic alignment for the long term. Venture studios and university-linked funds. Deep tech venture studio ecosystems can ensure research from universities makes the leap to scalable businesses. Initiatives such as Fraunhofer Ventures in Germany, CERN Venture Connect in Switzerland, and Creative Destruction Lab in Oxford illustrate this approach. Another good example is Evergreen Capital Vehicles, which helps nurture science spinouts before they transition into commercially focused entities.\n\nIt is important to note that these funding models alone are still not enough. They help create vibrant, regional successes, but the fragmentation of industries leaves infrastructure gaps in different European countries. The concentration of sectors like aerospace in Germany, batteries in Sweden, and EIT deep tech talent in Spain only widens such gaps. Progress is encouraging, but geographical coverage must be balanced to overcome Europe’s “patchwork” of financial inefficiencies.\n\nThe missing innovation: financial tools still not used\n\nDespite all these progressive financial models, truly innovative financial solutions remain largely absent from the deep tech ecosystem in Europe. Many think tanks, EU policy papers, and founder forums highlight the need for longer time-to-revenue projects and solutions to high upfront costs, but the current tools are not quite up to the task.\n\nAs of 2022, no European deep tech startup has successfully used IP-backed loans, R&D pre-purchase agreements, revenue-based financing, or advance market commitments. Such models are helpful, but have yet to tackle the challenges around scaling a business, time to market, and elevated risk profiles.\n\nThe dominance of traditional financial models exists because grants, equity rounds, and hybrid public-private schemes cannot account for regulatory uncertainty, lack of institutional experience, and risk aversion.\n\nAs a result, Europe is falling behind and will continue to do so until financial innovation moves from theoretical idea to practical application. The good news is that such adaptation is already happening elsewhere, providing a framework for Europe to follow.\n\nGlobal contrast: what works elsewhere\n\nThe US and Israel are turning deep tech into operational success using practical funding tools. Take Helion Energy in the US. The company has developed advanced fusion systems and recently raised $425mn to advance this technology over the next three years. Funding milestones were introduced to de-risk capital and support pre-purchase contracts.\n\nAnother example of adaptive funding fueling deep tech success is Climeworks. The company has benefited from revenue-based financing through corporate carbon offset agreements. Thanks to the predictable revenue streams, investors like Microsoft and Stripe have been able to provide funding crucial for scaling Climeworks’ direct air capture technology.\n\nInnovative funding has also boosted Israel’s Phantom Energy. The company is using IP-backed loans to enable prototyping without dilution, leveraging patents as collateral. In every case, the funding tool is designed to “match” the technology. Europe can learn from these successes. With flexible funding that accommodates longer development cycles and eases failure risks, the continent will progress further in deep tech.\n\nWhat Europe needs to change\n\nIf Europe wants a seat at the deep tech table, it needs to change. Incremental steps, like the examples listed above, won’t be enough. Insufficient patient capital with too many funds operating on short, exit-driven cycles must give way to new models. In their place, we need pan-European “evergreen” funds, growth-stage vehicles, and public-private platforms.\n\nFund sizes remain too small, and financial innovation is lacking. To address this, Europe needs well-publicised pilot projects involving creative investment models, such as IP-backed finance and non-dilutive hybrid modelling.\n\nIf Europe fosters greater collaboration and co-investment, we can reduce fragmentation and harmonise regulations. This could speed up grant distribution and create international “fast lanes” that shift the culture from fear of risk to celebrating experimentation.\n\nBold action is necessary to streamline bureaucracy and build technical investing talent that feeds both VCs and deep tech startups. We must change the culture. The deep tech investment ecosystem urgently needs to adapt to unlock the sector’s potential.\n\nFrom paradox to progress\n\nEurope has a world-class science community and a vibrant startup scene. To ensure success and stop promising projects from moving abroad, direct action is needed to scale deep tech ventures and address structural funding gaps.\n\nThe classic venture capital solution doesn’t fit the deep tech sector. While new models and regional initiatives are emerging and achieving some success, critical pieces are still missing, especially in late-stage capital and financial innovation.\n\nEurope must seize this pivotal moment to reshape its capital stack into one of patience, scale, and flexibility. That will foster resilient, world-leading companies. But it will take the collective work of policymakers, investors, and founders to move beyond theory and into actionable success.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"vc\", \"traditional\", \"failing\", \"models\", \"tech\", \"fix\", \"european\", \"deep\", \"europe\", \"investment\", \"funding\", \"financial\", \"capital\"]", "content_hash": "9a6ef7634a7892d15b43e8ab12e5383ce3c8728f5678969f68d30bd2c30957f1", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:55:58.505956+00:00"}

It was installed aboard a briefcase-sized satellite built and operated by UK-based startup Open Cosmos, and carried a machine learning processor developed by Dublin-based firm Ubotica.\n\nIn the test, the satellite tilted forward to scan 500km ahead of its orbit and snapped a preview image. Ubotica’s AI quickly analysed the scene to check for cloud cover. If the skies were clear, the satellite tilted back to take a detailed photo of the surface. If clouds obscured the view, it skipped the shot — saving time, storage, and bandwidth.\n\n“If you can be smart about what you’re taking pictures of, then you only image the ground and skip the clouds,” said Ben Smith of JPL, which funds the Dynamic Targeting work. “This technology will help scientists get a much higher proportion of usable data.”\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

They image whatever happens to be beneath them and beam all that data — useful or not — back to Earth. Scientists then sort through the backlog.\n\n“It takes post-processing, which could be days later, to say, ‘Hey, there was a fire. Hey, there was a harmful algal bloom’,” said Quinn in an article published on NASA’s website earlier this year.\n\nNASA, Ubotica, and OpenCosmos say the system could also be expanded to spot wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and severe storms faster than ever before from space.\n\nThe recent test builds on previous partnerships involving the three parties. In 2021, Ubotica demonstrated real-time AI cloud detection aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as part of a broader research collaboration with JPL.

The song sounds vaguely similar to Foley’s style, but the accompanying image features a blonde, young man who looks nothing like him.\n\n404 Media linked the track to a company account called Syntax Error, which was also responsible for several other seemingly fabricated numbers. One included “Happened To You,” a song supposedly performed by Grammy-winning country singer-songwriter Guy Clark, who died in 2016.\n\nSpotify removed the unauthorised tracks after 404 Media’s report was published. However, while this is a particularly grim example of AI-generated music on the Swedish streaming platform, it’s not the first — and unlikely to be the last.\n\nLast month, an AI-generated band called the Velvet Sundown popped up on Spotify. Its top track, “Dust on the Wind” — which sounds similar to the 1977 Kansas hit “Dust in the Wind” — has been played almost 2 million times since its release on June 20.\n\nVelvet Sundown’s Spotify bio now describes the band as a “synthetic music project,” but the platform doesn’t label the tracks — or any other music — as AI-generated.\n\nDaniel Ek, Spotify’s CEO, has taken a consistently laissez-faire approach to managing AI-generated content. Ek previously said that tracks created with AI were fair game on the platform — unless they mimicked real artists. However, Spotify seems to be doing a lousy job of identifying and removing these AI imitations as well, according to several reports.\n\nThe rise of AI-generated music on Spotify has sparked widespread backlash for several reasons. One involves the frequent use of AI tools like Suno or Udio, which generate entire tracks based on a simple text prompt. While the companies behind them claim that training their models on copyrighted music falls under “fair use,” opponents argue it amounts to copyright infringement. Critics also warn that AI-generated tracks compete for streams, reducing the share of royalties available to human artists.\n\nSophie Jones, the chief strategy officer at the music trade body the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), called for new protections in an interview with the Guardian last week.\n\n“The rise of AI-generated bands and music entering the market points to the fact that tech companies have been training AI models using creative works — largely without authorisation or payment to creators and rights-holders — in order to directly compete with human artistry,” she said.\n\nAnother concern is that deceiving listeners with AI-generated profiles and songs is a form of misinformation that risks ruining the reputation of human artists.\n\nTo give creators a fair shot, Jones and others argue that streaming platforms should start by clearly labelling AI-generated content. That’s a move pioneered by rival streaming app Deezer, which has developed an algorithm that can identify artificially created songs made using several popular generative AI models, including Suno and Udio.\n\n“AI is not inherently good or bad, but we believe a responsible and transparent approach is key to building trust with our users and the music industry,” Deezer’s CEO Alexis Lanternier said in June.\n\n“We are also clear in our commitment to safeguarding the rights of artists and songwriters at a time where copyright law is being put into question in favour of training AI models.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"music\", \"tracks\", \"songs\", \"track\", \"outrage\", \"models\", \"exploitation\", \"spotify\", \"fresh\", \"dead\", \"spotifys\", \"artists\", \"aigenerated\", \"streaming\", \"training\", \"spark\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "30da356ee33a5319fe7aee061ebf9f63326fbca30078f6583206c587ef403a26", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:03.610628+00:00"}

They’re pitched as a way for brands to save money while showcasing more diversity in their advertisements.\n\nBrowzwear, best known for developing 3D design tools that let fashion brands prototype clothes without making physical samples, was already a Lalaland user before the acquisition. CEO Greg Hanson said the company is now bringing the Lalaland team fully “in-house.”\n\n“Our customers want absolute confidence in their digital twins,” he continued. “Lalaland’s hyper-realistic, diverse AI models supercharge that trust and dramatically cut the time between concept and commerce.”\n\nSingapore-based Browzwear will integrate Lalaland’s AI team into its R&D division, where they’ll focus on improving the accuracy of virtual body shapes for better fit prediction.

In March 2023, denim brand Levi’s revealed plans to test Lalaland’s AI-generated avatars to showcase more diverse body types and underrepresented groups on its website.\n\nThe move led to accusations that Levi’s was looking for a shortcut to the commercial benefits of diversity. A few days after the announcement, the brand put out another statement saying that it remains committed to live photo shoots, real models, and authentic diversity.\n\nMusandu, meanwhile, insists that Lalaland was never designed to replace traditional photo shoots — or human models.\n\n“We believe human models will continue to play a vital role in the fashion industry, establishing genuine connections with consumers; our technology aims to support this,” he said shortly after the Levi’s controversy.\n\n“And, yes — we need more of them to come from underrepresented groups if fashion companies are serious about inclusion efforts.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"lalalands\", \"dutch\", \"models\", \"fashion\", \"startup\", \"levis\", \"diverse\", \"model\", \"avatars\", \"browzwear\", \"aigenerated\", \"snaps\", \"lalaland\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "dcf16ad3faa997682fed9268effd889bbbfb05eaedd08520c4dec8c48c966e8e", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:05.004461+00:00"}

Funding into newer tech firms remains complex, with Startup Genome reporting that while the Beijing, Los Angeles and Tokyo startup landscapes are seeing YoY growth, Paris is flat and the rest of the European ecosystem is in decline. Meanwhile, the technology landscape continues to evolve at an accelerating pace. As Deloitte’s 2025 Tech Trends report states: “technology optimisation and transformation have never been more important as innovation continues to fuel innovation.”\n\nThis is creating a landscape where large enterprises are struggling to be on the front foot of technology adoption, while juggling the impacts of economic and geopolitical uncertainty and shifting regulations. Meanwhile, startups are hustling to develop solutions to enterprise problems in an ecosystem with lower than usual venture capital investment. All in all: the zeitgeist is fast-paced, complicated, and confusing… but it’s pretty exciting to be part of what is truly a historic moment for the world’s relationship with technology.\n\nAs I shared with industry leaders at The Next Web’s ‘Innovating at Scale’ panel, this turbulence has forced a rethink of what it means to operate and innovate at scale. In this environment, resilience isn’t just about weathering storms; it’s about evolving in real time, making decisions with imperfect information and finding opportunity in volatility.\n\nThe reality of volatility: our experience\n\n2024 was brutal for many in the technology sector. The industry whiplashed from pandemic-fuelled overhiring to a sharp correction, all while economic fragility tested even the strongest partnerships. Delayed payments, vanished purchase orders and a rise in ‘ghosting’ became the norm for suppliers, as organisations were increasingly pressured to deliver more with fewer resources.\n\nYet in 2025, amid the unpredictability, there is a palpable sense of renewal. We’re seeing a resurgence in growth-focused investment, which has materialized for us in the form of a spike in marketing and communications briefs, as businesses recalibrate for a world where resilience, agility and purpose are not optional extras but central to survival.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\nThis is good news for the technology sector, and great news for Clarity as a technology focussed digital marketing and communications agency. But we’re not out of the woods yet and, as we discussed in my panel at The Next Web Conference, we all need to be playing multiple moves ahead.\n\nLessons from Innovation Under Pressure, the panel I hosted at The Next Web Conference 2025\n\nAt The Next Web, I was privileged to host a panel with leaders from organisations at the forefront of global innovation: Monika Tomczak-Górlikowska, Group Head of Privacy, Digital & Regulatory at Prosus Group (an ecosystem for lifestyle e-commerce entrepreneurs); Ernesto Lasalandra, Chief Research & Development Officer at Ferrari; Shez Partovi, Chief Innovation Officer and Chief Business Leader Healthcare Informatics, Philips; and Seth Dobrin, Co-Founding General Partner, 1Infinity Ventures (a global responsible AI fund). Their experiences underscored a universal truth that most in the business world have now accepted: innovation at scale is no longer a luxury, but a necessity.\n\nA few key themes emerged:\n\n1. Regulation is now a core business competency: Technology firms’ success demands that legal, privacy and cybersecurity voices are not just consulted, but embedded in the innovation process. Regulatory change and policy discussions must not be ignored, they are signals to prioritise, adapt and build solutions that will endure across borders and business models.\n\n2. Partnership is the engine of progress: Whether it’s Ferrari’s open innovation approach, where thousands of startups are scrutinised for their potential to drive (pardon the pun) next-generation solutions, or Philips’ customer-driven partnerships to solve real-world pain points, the message is clear: innovation thrives in ecosystems not silos. The most transformative ideas solve genuine problems and are developed in collaboration with partners, suppliers and, most importantly, customers.\n\n3. Culture is critical: Across the panel there was consensus that innovation must be woven into the fabric of the business, not siloed in a standalone team. This means cultivating a culture where experimentation is encouraged, failure is reframed as learning and agility is prized over perfection. Members of the panel flagged that an obsession with perfection was potentially a key boulder holding the European tech ecosystem from competing more strongly with the U.S. and key APAC markets. As Shez Partovi of Philips put it, “…if you don’t change your mind a lot, you’re probably wrong a lot.”\n\nNow, Near, Next: Building resilience for whatever comes next\n\nSo, how can businesses not only survive, but thrive in this change-centric environment? At Clarity, we guide our clients to adopt a “Now, Near, Next” mindset, one that aligns immediate action with longer-term vision, all powered by data and relentless agility and adaptation.\n\nThe ‘Now’ is about managing risk and protecting reputation today. In an era of 24/7 scrutiny, every company is just one misstep away from a crisis. Clear, consistent communications and robust stakeholder engagement are the foundations of trust.\n\n‘Near’ focuses on sustaining innovation and growth. This means investing in partnerships, nurturing talent through powerful employee communications and building the capacity to pivot when disruption strikes. Businesses must constantly be asking: what do we need to change in the next 12 months to stay relevant?\n\nFinally, ‘Next’ is about future-proofing: embedding purpose, ethics and sustainability into strategy. As AI, regulation and societal expectations evolve, the winners will be those who anticipate change and act with conviction.\n\nInfluence the world, impact the future\n\nTaking the ‘Now, Near, Next’ approach is not just a communications and marketing strategy, it’s a business imperative. The world isn’t slowing down, and neither can we. By embracing regulatory complexity, forging purposeful partnerships and building a culture of constant learning, businesses can not only navigate uncertainty, but define the future on their own terms. Because in a world of relentless change, Clarity isn’t just what we offer our clients, it’s what every business needs to move forward with confidence.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"ongoing\", \"change\", \"tech\", \"panel\", \"communications\", \"partnerships\", \"uncertainty\", \"technology\", \"requires\", \"ecosystem\", \"world\", \"near\", \"business\", \"living\", \"innovation\", \"navigating\"]", "content_hash": "c99dbad19689e5669ea44289fa9a769057349ef333d3936c819c3a86cf6998fe", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:08.042606+00:00"}

It’s the latest company heading to the far north to tap into abundant green energy and natural cooling for power-hungry data centres.\n\nThe facility will be located in the Norwegian coastal town of Narvik, which lies 220km within the Arctic Circle. Aker’s president and CEO, Øyvind Eriksen said that the site already had access to 230MW of power and was ready for construction to commence. He added that discussions with potential tech firms and partners for the project were ongoing.\n\nHowever, Eriksen provided limited details on the facility’s purpose, stating it will “serve as a catalyst for industrial development, job creation, and export revenues.”\n\n“AI and data centres are becoming foundational to global business, and northern Norway is uniquely positioned to benefit,” said Eriksen. “The region offers abundant, affordable hydropower and clean energy, along with the conditions needed to attract investment and foster innovation.”\n\nAker, which is majority-owned by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke, has a number of AI and software investments under its belt, including in Bitcoin investment firm Seetee and industrial data company Cognite. Eriksen said the AI facility in Narvik would represent an opportunity to “enter a new value chain early.”\n\nBits meet blizzards\n\nThe Nordic region is fast becoming a global hotspot for AI data infrastructure. Last year, Google committed another €1bn to its Hamina campus in southern Finland, marking its seventh expansion. The data centre upgrade aims to support surging demand for AI compute while tapping into the region’s large supplies of renewable energy.\n\nNot far away, Amsterdam-based Nebius announced in October that it’s tripling GPU capacity at its Mäntsälä site in Sweden, where it aims to run 60,000 GPUs for AI applications.\n\nAlso in Sweden, Microsoft bet $3.2bn (€2.7bn) to boost its cloud and AI capacity across its three data centres in the country last year. The tech giant is also reportedly developing a dozen new sites in Finland under its “power-first” strategy, aimed at meeting massive AI compute demands while pushing toward its carbon-negative goals.\n\nBig Tech aside, the Nordics are also sprouting their own homegrown AI players, including the likes of Finland’s Silo AI, which was bought by chipmaker AMD in a $665mn (571mn) deal in October.\n\nWith Aker now hopping on the AI bandwagon, the region’s remote edges could be turning into ground zero for Europe’s next tech race.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"eriksen\", \"frozen\", \"tech\", \"rush\", \"norwegian\", \"site\", \"regions\", \"industrial\", \"data\", \"sweden\", \"investment\", \"north\", \"gold\", \"joins\", \"firm\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "2f264f7834d9fb3988c758f1677a1f06925bb0f440475fde9f57b4c30f5759cd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:09.350511+00:00"}

Last week, we looked at the largest investment rounds in the Netherlands, and now we’re honing in on Europe’s budding fusion energy sector.\n\nEuropean fusion energy startups raised a record €290mn in the first half of this year as VCs bet big on a technology with the potential to supply virtually limitless clean power.\n\nFunding in 2025 has already eclipsed 2024 levels — the previous record year — which saw fusion energy companies raise €185mn, according to Dealroom data.\n\nLeading the pack this year was Munich-based Proxima Fusion. The company secured €130mn in Series A funding in June from big-name investors including Balderton Capital, Cherry Ventures, and Plural. The round marked Europe’s largest single investment in a fusion energy startup.\n\nProxima, which was spun out of the prestigious Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in 2023, aims to commercialise a type of fusion machine known as a stellarator. Shaped like a twisted metal doughnut, the stellarator is far more complex to design than the more common tokamak — but if engineered correctly, it could provide a more stable and continuous source of fusion power.\n\nCredit: Proxima Fusion 3D render of Stellaris, a fusion energy reactor designed by Proxima Fusion. Credit: Proxima Fusion\n\nThe year’s second biggest cash injection went to another Munich-based company: Marvel Fusion. The company raised €113mn in a Series B funding round in March led by investors including EQT and Siemens Energy.\n\nMarvel is developing a type of laser-based fusion called inertial confinement. Instead of using big magnets or giant reactors like other fusion approaches, the method fires ultra-powerful lasers at tiny fuel pellets made of hydrogen. The lasers create extreme heat and pressure, causing the hydrogen atoms to fuse together and release energy — similar to how the sun works, but in short, controlled bursts. Last year, Marvel broke ground on a $150mn laser facility in Colorado.\n\nOther significant funding rounds in Europe’s budding fusion energy sector this year went to France’s Renaissance Fusion, which raised €32mn for its stellarator design, and Sweden’s Novatron, which secured €10mn to build a unique type of fusion reactor it described to TNW as a “mirror machine.”\n\nThe record funding comes as Europe races to take the lead in the race to launch the first commercially viable fusion reactor, which the majority of industry experts believe will come online sometime in the 2030s.\n\nFrancesco Sciortino, co-founder and CEO of Proxima, believes fusion energy can complement wind and solar power and become a “decisive building block” for Europe’s energy security.\n\n“Fusion holds the potential to fundamentally transform the way we think about energy, changing the world from a place that’s controlled by those with reserves of oil and gas, to one where technology lets countries control their own fate,” he previously told TNW.\n\nSciortino believes Europe has the potential to lead in the technology. However, funding for fusion on the continent still pales in comparison to the US.\n\nIn the first half of this year, US-based fusion startups secured a combined $1.6bn (€1.3bn) in investment, over four times more than their European counterparts.

The ring’s sensors have been given a complete overhaul, resulting in more accurate readings, the company said.\n\nCircular has also scrapped the USB charger for a wireless charging dock. The Ring 2’s battery life lasts up to an impressive eight days, one more day than the Oura Ring.\n\nHowever, the main innovation — a first for smart rings — is the addition of an FDA-cleared atrial fibrillation (AFib) sensor that reads the electrical activity of your heart, including the rate and rhythm.\n\nAs a result, Circular goes on to call its new ring a “discreet heart health companion.” It’s a bit cheesy, but the AFib sensor could provide a warning of an incoming stroke or heart attack — so the tagline has some substance.\n\nCircular has also introduced a potentially game-changing digital sizing process. Instead of having to purchase a physical sizing kit prior to buying a smart ring, Circular allows you to measure your finger directly from your phone.\n\n“This isn’t just a wearable,” said Amaury Kosman, Circular’s co-founder and CEO. “It’s a statement piece that empowers our users to take control of their wellness without compromising on style.”\n\nWhile the Ring 2 is a complete upgrade, the company has done away with a haptic motor that served as a vibrating alarm clock in the first iteration.\n\nThe Circular Ring 2 is expected to launch via a crowd-funding campaign in mid-to-late January before shipping in March with a starting price of $380. That’s a bit pricier than the Oura Ring 4 ($349). However, unlike Oura’s, the Circular ring is available subscription-free.\n\nWhile Circular’s new smart ring sounds great on paper, it remains to be seen whether it can pull it off and produce reliable devices at scale. If it does prove a success, that won’t necessarily be a bad thing for Oura though. The Finnish company receives a royalty fee for all Circular rings sold in the US, based on a multi-year patent infringement agreement signed last year.

It was ambitiously transforming itself into a digital society with innovations such as e-government and online voting.\n\nAnd, of course, it gave birth to Skype, the company that would launch the small Baltic nation’s journey towards becoming a startup powerhouse and a “unicorn country.”\n\nSince then, Estonia has established itself as a leader in breeding high-profile software companies, such as Bolt and Wise. Now, it’s aiming to become a deeptech hub, accelerating the development of research- and science-based entrepreneurship.\n\nDeeptech in Estonia is still relatively young. As many as 70% of the companies have emerged over the last five years.\n\nNevertheless, the sector is growing quickly. In 2023, deeptech startups reached a record €227.2mnin turnover — a 14% increase from the year before. They also raised €394mn, rising from €254mn the previous year.\n\nTowards a deeptech hub\n\nThe Estonian government’s vision is for deeptech companies to account for about 30% of the country’s total startup volume by 2030. This translates into 500 deeptech startups — up from 132 in 2023.\n\nOne key component of Estonia’s action plan is to facilitate further access to funding, mainly in the form of grants and angel investment, especially for early-stage businesses.\n\nAnother is boosting entrepreneurship within academia with dedicated courses for students. Equally important is ensuring a smooth spinout process.\n\nAccording to Sten Tamkivi, early executive at Skype and partner at VC firm Plural, the Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) and the University of Tartu have both taken active steps in the past years.\n\n“They have created their own venture arms and they have made sure that the spinout IP and equity process is easier,” Tamkivi tells TNW.\n\nA third component are the their startups themselves — and their ability to turn scientific advancements into commercial products.\n\nCosmic rays for 3D scanning\n\nTallinn-based GSCAN is using muon tomography for 3D scanning and chemical composition analysis.\n\nMuons are subatomic particles that make up half the cosmic radiation reaching the Earth’s atmosphere.\n\nGSCAN collects muons with its proprietary detector technology, which combines the use of AI to measure the flux of muons when penetrating an object, to create 3D visualisations, and analyse the materials.\n\nGSCAN’s system is modular and can see through every material up to 20 metres in thickness. Source: GSCAN\n\n“This is a platform technology that you can use everywhere, much like X-ray tomography,” Andi Hektor, co-founder and chief strategy officer at the startup and former researcher at CERN, tells TNW.\n\nAccording to Hektor, muon tomography offers significant advantages over X-rays. Firstly, it has the ability to penetrate very large objects and provide information about the chemical composition of materials. It’s also safer for humans and the environment, as muons are a result of natural radiation.\n\nOne of GSCAN’s focus areas is non-destructive testing (NDT) for the built environment. NDT helps evaluate the properties of a material or structure for potential defects without causing damage.\n\nHektor provides an example.\n\n“The world is full of old bridges, buildings, and tunnels made of reinforced concrete. Reinforced concrete has a finite lifetime and inside these structures there are metals subject to corrosion.”\n\n“Understanding what’s happening inside these structures is vital both for safety and economic reasons,” he says.\n\nGSCAN counts multiple projects so far, including the scanning of two old nuclear reactors for their safe decommissioning process.\n\nAlongside the built environment, the startup is also using its technology for customs and security applications.\n\nIn March, GSCAN raised a €3mn seed round from investors including Bolt’s founder Markus Villig. This brought the total amount raised since its founding in 2018 to €5.1mn.\n\nGreen carbon nanomaterials and graphite\n\nA spinout from the University of Tartu, Up Catalyst transforms CO2 emissions into green carbon nanomaterials and graphite.\n\nThe startup’s technology extracts CO2 from waste biomass and flue gases from heavy industry emitters. It then converts it into green carbon with a process called molten salt electrolysis.\n\n“We’re essentially electro-transforming carbon dioxide gases into carbon nanomaterials,” Apostolos Segkos, head of development at Up Catalyst, tells TNW.\n\nThe startup’s first goal is to achieve price parity with traditional carbon sources. Its second is to reduce dependence on fossil fuel-based carbon, while minimising the environmental impact of raw material production.\n\nAccording to Segkos, Up Catalyst’s mission aligns with the EU’s objectives for the energy transition and the need for securing a reliable (and ideally domestic) supply chain of critical raw materials.\n\n“Graphite, among other key carbon products, is considered a critical material by the EU, especially as we import about 99% of it, which mostly comes from China.”\n\nGraphite is a key component of EV batteries, which typically contain between 50kg and 100kg of the material.\n\nFor their part, carbon nanomaterials are valuable additives in energy generation and storage devices, including batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells.\n\nInside Up Catalyst’s lab. On the left: Apostolos Segkos. Source: Up Catalyst\n\nIn July, Up Catalyst received a €2.36mn funding boost to accelerate the development of a pilot industrial reactor.\n\nAccording to the startup, the reactor will be able to produce 100 tonnes of CO2 per year, which can deliver 27 tonnes of green carbon materials.\n\nUp Catalyst spun out from the University of Tartu in 2019.\n\n“We had a good success case because we managed to fully transfer the IP from the university to the company,” Teele Niidas, the startup’s CMO, tells TNW.\n\nDespite some “difficult bits” of negotiation, the spinout process was “fairly easy,” Niidas says.\n\n“I think everyone [in the Estonian ecosystem] realises that science-based startups have a big future if they are indeed supported by academia.”\n\nHarnessing nanotech for wound dressing\n\nAnother startup in the field of nanotech is Nanordica Medical, which has developed an antibacterial wound dressing.\n\nA spinout from Estonia’s National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics (NICPB), the startup sought to create a more effective solution for bacterial wound infections. These affect approximately 100 million people worldwide, including those suffering from diabetes.\n\n“Mainstream wound dressings use silver,” Olesja Bondarenko, Nanordica’s CEO tells TNW.\n\n“Silver has good antibacterial properties. But the problem is that it also has side effects and can lead to impaired wound healing.”\n\nFollowing research, the team discovered that the key lied in combining silver with copper nanoparticles.\n\n“We found that they amplify each other, while reducing adverse effects,” Bondarenko says.\n\nNanordica’s dressing works by attracting the bacteria and inactivating their effect, which enables tissue regeneration and wound healing. The Tallinn-based startup says the solution offers 8x better treatment compared to standard care products.\n\nThe company has already run a small clinical trial in Estonia with 30 diabetic patients suffering from food ulcer. Results were promising, with the wound dressing showing twice as fast healing compared to a commonly used silver alternative.\n\nNanordica plans to confirm these findings with an upcoming larger trial and expects to get approval by the EU’s health regulator this year.\n\nFollowing the intended commercialisation of its wound dressing by 2025, the company will aim to expand its range of antibacterial products.\n\nNanordica Medical’s wund dressings in various sizes. Image provided by Olesja Bondarenko.\n\nNanordica recently raised €1.75mn from VC investors. In the first years after its founding in 2019, it relied on funding from the founders and grants from EIC, Enterprise Estonia, and the NICPB — from which it bought the IP.\n\nAccording to Bondarenko, software has historically dominated investor interest.\n\n“But now, I think there is a real transformation,” says Bondarenko.\n\n“There is more and more understanding that science-based deeptech is very important. And the same investors that were focusing on software are now considering different possibilities.”\n\n“The chances are very high that we will soon see unicorns in healthtech, and deeptech in general.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"wound\", \"deeptech\", \"startup\", \"startups\", \"university\", \"estonia\", \"tells\", \"science\", \"technology\", \"breeding\", \"generation\", \"spinout\", \"booming\", \"carbon\"]", "content_hash": "480b36587a732b16c1834aa27eec2cae85373bf072496f335515868c67b230b4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:15.827346+00:00"}

It is now Britain’s most downloaded free app, overtaking ChatGPT, according to Apple’s App Store rankings.\n\nThe Switzerland-based virtual private network (VPN) said in a post on X that the surge in interest has been “sustained.” This contrasts with recent short-term spikes, such as when people in France temporarily lost access to adult sites like Pornhub and RedTube last month due to new legislation.\n\nThe surge in downloads follows the UK government’s rollout of the Online Safety Act, which came into effect after midnight on Friday, July 25. The law requires websites such as Pornhub, Reddit, and TikTok to implement strict age verification measures, including uploading an official ID or using third-party identity checks.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art.

However, VPNs provide a relatively easy way to circumvent the new law. By masking a user’s location, they can make it appear as if internet users are accessing the web from outside the UK, where the new law doesn’t apply.\n\nOfcom, the UK’s communications regulator, has warned against using VPNs to sidestep the new rules. Meanwhile, Katie Freeman-Tayler of children’s safety group Internet Matters has raised concerns about how easily children can access VPNs.\n\n“This makes it easy for them to circumvent important protections introduced under the Online Safety Act, such as age checks designed to shield them from adult content,” she told the BBC.\n\nProton isn’t the only company benefiting from the new law. Of the top ten free apps in Apple’s UK ranking, six are currently VPN services. They include Yoti, NordVPN, and Free VPN.\n\n“We would normally associate these large spikes in sign-ups with major civil unrest,” Proton said in a statement. “This clearly shows that adults are concerned about the impact universal age verification laws will have on their privacy.”\n\nProton and other tech firms have previously criticised aspects of the Online Safety Act, warning the law could erode user privacy by forcing companies to scan private messages or break end-to-end encryption.\n\nCriticism has also come from political quarters. Nigel Farage, leader of right-wing political party Reform UK, pledged this week to repeal the rules, labelling them “authoritarian” and a threat to free speech. A separate petition to overturn the Online Safety Act has racked up over 350,000 signatures, triggering a parliamentary review.\n\nGrowing demand for VPNs, meanwhile, has sparked fears that the government could ban the services.

The company says it considered using AI to “improve content moderation” in the future, but that such a feature “hasn’t been built or deployed in practice.”\n\nWeTransfer has also now amended its terms of service, removing any mentions of machine learning. The updated version states that users grant the company “a royalty-free license” to use their content for “operating, developing, and improving the service.”\n\nBut the damage to user trust may already be done.\n\nWhy are users so concerned?\n\nWeChat joins a growing list of companies that have attracted criticism for training machine learning systems on user data. Adobe, Zoom, Slack, Dropbox, and others have also recently walked back or clarified similar AI-related policies after public outcry. All these incidents tap into wider frustrations around copyright and consent in the AI age — and point to trust issues between users and tech firms.\n\nWeTransfer has long marketed itself as a creative-friendly, privacy-conscious file-sharing service. So it’s perhaps unsurprising that the vague wording around AI and sweeping license rights felt like a betrayal to its users, particularly for artists and freelancers worried their work could be quietly fed into machine learning models without consent.\n\nWhile WeTransder did clarify its terms, for many users of the service, the damage was already done. In replies to WeTransfer’s official announcement on X, some said that it looked like the service had tested the waters with broader AI permissions, got swift public backlash, and then quickly walked it back.\n\nWeTransfer is unlikely to be the last tech firm caught up in this kind of controversy.

It plans to do this with what it calls a “God Mode” view of the internet.\n\nAt the heart of Whisper’s approach is a massive, real-time map of global internet infrastructure. The map is built from more than 45 billion data points sourced from 18 different systems, such as domain name registries (DNS), IP address databases, routing protocols (BGP), and ownership records (Whois).\n\nUsing knowledge graph technology to organise this information, the map updates in sub-seconds. Whisper’s CEO Leonardo Carlo Calisse said it allows cybersecurity teams to enter the aforementioned “God Mode,” a term borrowed from gaming, where it denotes invincibility and total control.\n\n“‘God Mode’ refers to Whisper’s advanced cybersecurity visibility, an unprecedented, real-time view of the entire internet’s infrastructure,” Calisse told TNW. “It enables organisations to detect and track cyber threats by exposing attacker infrastructure and hidden relationships before any damage occurs.”\n\nWhisper’s platform returns real-time threat scores and metadata on anything from a suspicious domain to a shadowy network cluster. It’s also been designed to minimise false alarms, using what the company describes as entropy-based scoring to help security teams save time.\n\nThe cyber threat landscape\n\nWhisper arrives in challenging times for online security. Cyber attacks are becoming harder to detect as threat actors deploy increasingly sophisticated methods. These include so-called multi-vector attacks — coordinated campaigns that target different parts of a system simultaneously. Artificial intelligence is also increasingly used to automate and disguise malicious activity online.\n\nAs these tactics evolve, the overall scale of cybercrime is increasing rapidly, having surged over 300% since 2015. McKinsey estimates global cybersecurity-related losses could hit $10.5 trillion (€9 trillion) annually by the end of 2025.\n\nCalisse said he believes the surge in the amount and type of online crime demands an “entirely new generation” of cybersecurity tools.\n\nSince launching in January, Whisper has already secured pilot projects with other cybersecurity providers.

That’s great for innovation", "authors": "[\"Bogdan Gogulan\", \"Story By\"]", "published": "2025-06-13T06:00:27+00:00", "text": "A few months ago, at the SmallSat Symposium, a panel issued a sobering warning to space startups: do not chase defence dollars at the expense of long-term sustainability. Why? Because companies, particularly in the space sector, might be tempted to follow the money rather than focus on producing valuable products and services with broader, longer-term applications. It’s of course true that any company should be wary of “leaning in” too closely to what seem like passing fads. But the warning overlooks an important reality: the shift towards defence investing is not a trend. It’s a transformation in space and space investment, and one that will have positive — albeit unintended — consequences.\n\nAcross the space sector, there has been a noticeable shift towards focusing on pure defence investing. Companies that once prioritised commercial applications, or at most maintained dual-use business models, are now making full-scale pivots to defence. Needless to say, that move isn’t random. It’s the product of geopolitical changes, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and a widespread belief that the world is changing. As Michael Gove, who served in the Cabinets of four British prime ministers, put it recently: “The ideal of a rules-based international order, where multilateral institutions restrain states pursuing their self-interest, has proved to be a false hope… we are back to a world closer to that of Thucydides in which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”\n\nThe change is happening at the public sector level, too. In 2024, global governmental expenditure on space programmes surged to $135 billion (€119 billion) — up 10% from the year before. The primary driver was rising defence budgets. A recent Bruegel report concluded that without support from the United States, “Europe could need 300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least €250 billion” to keep the continent safe. As geopolitical tensions rise, governments worldwide have been funnelling money into space-based defence technology, a recognition that the sector is the cornerstone of any modern military.\n\nOne of the unintended yet highly beneficial consequences of this shift among startups is its impact on the private space sector. Increased defence investment is breathing new life into aerospace and deep-tech innovation. Companies that previously struggled to secure commercial funding are now benefiting from sustained government investment, allowing them to work on cutting-edge technologies. These include (among many others) optical communications, needed for secure and high-speed space-based data transmission; Earth observation, crucial for climate monitoring, disaster response, and resource management; and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), enabling all-weather, day-and-night imaging capabilities with high precision.\n\nDespite the opportunities that await here, moving from purely commercial to defence markets is not without its hurdles. Startups can face significant challenges. Government contracts often come with delayed payments and long procurement cycles, creating cashflow issues for smaller firms that lack financial reserves. Defence-related technologies are subject to stringent export controls and compliance requirements, heaping bureaucratic burdens on startups that many are ill-equipped to bear.\n\nBut for those companies that make the pivot successfully, the rewards far outweigh these obstacles. Defence funding provides long-term stability and a runway for companies to develop world-class technology that may later be commercialised in other sectors. In other words, to pivot into space isn’t necessarily to leave behind the commercial world.\n\nSome startups are making full-blown pivots to defence, but the real sweet spot remains in the world of dual-use technology — those innovations that serve both commercial and defence markets. Companies that maintain this balance benefit from diverse revenue streams, greater resilience to market fluctuations, and the ability to shift emphasis as commercial demand evolves.\n\nThe success of this dual-use approach is plain to see in the companies that have seamlessly integrated their offerings across sectors. Take the SAR satellite company ICEYE, whose data is used in flood response, maritime activity monitoring, and conflict zones like Ukraine. Or FibreCoat, whose advanced materials protect satellites from the harsh conditions of space, regardless of what those satellites are used for.\n\nGiven the scale of government investment, as well as the ongoing volatility in the broader geopolitical landscape, it’s highly unlikely that the present shift in focus towards defence is merely a fad. There is a new world order in place, and national security considerations will play a defining role in geopolitics for years to come.\n\nHowever, the space sector’s ultimate goal should be a balanced ecosystem where defence and commercial efforts reinforce one another. The current surge in defence spending is helping accelerate technological innovation, funding infrastructure that will benefit the commercial sector in the long run. As companies continue to develop dual-use applications, they can ensure that the innovations sparked by defence priorities also drive broader commercial progress.\n\nThat’s good news because space touches almost every area of modern life. It’s the backbone of the world economy. It plays a vital role in navigation, communication, connectivity, and sustainability. The space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion (€1.58 trillion) by 2035, according to a report by McKinsey and the World Economic Forum. We may well be entering a new golden age for the industry, one in which entrepreneurs have access to more capital, investors are more willing to back high-risk ventures, and technology development is progressing at an unprecedented pace.\n\nIf companies can navigate the challenges of defence contracting while remaining mindful of the broader commercial applications of their products, the entire space ecosystem stands to benefit. For startups, the key will be balancing short-term defence opportunities with long-term strategic growth, so ensuring that today’s pivot does not become tomorrow’s dead end. But if the evolution towards greater defence investing is managed wisely by all involved parties, it could propel the space industry into its most vibrant era yet.\n\nDefence tech will be a hot topic at TNW Conference, which takes place in Amsterdam on June 19-20.

Drones now swarm where soldiers once marched, AI can detect threats faster than spies, and cyberattacks are disrupting critical infrastructure without a single shot fired. To prepare for the battles of tomorrow, NATO is turning to startups.\n\nIn June 2023, the Alliance launched DIANA, an initiative that funds and facilitates defence innovations. Across a network of over 200 accelerator sites and test centres, DIANA brings together universities, industry, and governments to work with startups on new defence capabilities.\n\nAt the helm is Jyoti Hirani-Driver. A former counter-terrorism policy advisor for the British government, Hirani-Driver was appointed DIANA COO last year. Her mission: to find dual-use technology that can serve both soldiers and civilians in the 32 NATO member nations — and get it into the field before NATO’s adversaries do.\n\n“It’s the first time ever we’re working as one on defence innovation,” she tells TNW.\n\nThe 💜 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene, a story from our wise ol' founder Boris, and some questionable AI art. It's free, every week, in your inbox. Sign up now!\n\n“We’ve always needed cutting-edge tech and innovation. We need it to outpace our adversaries and to make sure our armed forces have the best warfighting capabilities. DIANA can help us do that.”\n\nAt TNW Conference on June 19, Hirani-Driver will share her views on the rise of defence tech during a panel discussion between four of Europe’s leaders in the sector. Ahead of the session, she outlined the goals of DIANA — and the value of dual-use tech.\n\nThe defence tech path to market\n\nDelivering new innovations to the armed forces can be a tricky task. The defence market has long been the domain of big contractors, complex integration processes, and lengthy procurement cycles — which can delay the uptake of emerging technologies. It can also be challenging for startups to navigate.\n\nHer career in government gave Hirani-Driver a deep understanding of the obstacles.\n\nShe was working in counter-terrorism during the rise of ISIS and supported British responses to terrorist attacks. Her experiences showed that national security required new approaches.\n\n“We knew we couldn’t just keep doing the same thing,” she says. “We needed to look at innovation and engage with the tech industry.”\n\nHirani-Driver soon had a chance to put that into practice. In 2018, she was appointed Chief of Staff for the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) Defence Innovation Directorate. Under her leadership, the unit secured £1.1bn (€1.3bn) of tech R&D funding for the MoD. The investments backed advances in hypersonics, big data, autonomous systems, AI, and space-based technologies.\n\n“My job there was to embed innovation into the lifeblood of defence — not just in terms of capabilities, but in our people as well,” she says.\n\n“We need to think innovatively in everything we do. We need to become smarter at training our people, giving them the experience so they know what to expect and how to succeed on the battlefield.”\n\nThat mindset underpins DIANA’s mission to support dual-use tech. The approach expands the talent pool by attracting companies from outside the defence sector, accelerates adoption through faster-moving civilian markets, and boosts commercial viability through broader revenue streams. If startups can scale and survive in the civilian world, they’re more likely to succeed in defence.\n\n“There are startups doing amazing things in the civilian world that don’t realise how valuable they could be to defence,” says Hirani-Driver. “We help them make that leap.”\n\nHirani-Driver was appointed COO of NATO DIANA in January 2024. Credit: NATO\n\nHow startups can make the leap\n\nDIANA’s programmes call for solutions to specific defence and security challenges. The last five were Energy & Power; Data & Information Security; Sensing & Surveillance; Human Health & Performance; and Critical Infrastructure & Logistics.\n\nSuccessful applicants then enter a six-month programme delivered by accelerator sites across the Alliance. They also gain access to NATO mentors, end-users, and unique test centres.\n\nOne of these test sites is CR14 in Estonia, a military-grade “multiverse of cyber ranges” comprising virtual environments for cybersecurity development. Under DIANA’s umbrella, British startup Goldilock went there to validate a physical network isolation solution that instantly disconnects and physically segments critical national infrastructure.\n\nHirani-Driver says the experience offered more than technical validation: “They can take that as a stamp of approval that their technology has been validated at one of the best cyber test centres in the Alliance.”\n\nEach selected startup also receives €100,000 — but Hirani-Driver insists that cash is not the main value. “The gem in our programme is connecting those startups with end users, mentors, and test centres,” she says.\n\n“I don’t want them to receive a bit of funding, finish the programme, and disappear from our ecosystem. Success for us means keeping those good ideas alive, helping them grow, and eventually seeing them deliver tech directly to our forces.”\n\nA diverse array of them have already progressed through the programmes. They range from Goldilock’s cyber defence system, to Lithuanian startup Astrolight’s secure laser communication systems, and Polish tech firm Revobeam’s intelligent antennas — which are particularly suited for unmanned vehicles operating in challenging environments.\n\nThe Netherlands has also been represented. Delft-based Lobster Robotics joined DIANA last year after catching attention for its autonomous underwater vehicles for seabed mapping — a technology valuable for both marine conservation and naval surveillance.\n\n“I want to see Lobster Robotics delivering to the Navies across the Alliance,” Hirani-Driver says.\n\nWith the next wave of DIANA challenges launching this summer, the programme is set to expand into additional focus areas. Hirani-Driver wants them to bring new innovations to NATO’s warfighting capabilities.\n\n“Big defence contractors have an important role to play in the security of the Alliance, but we continually need new players, more choice — and better tech,” she says. “Innovations from early-stage startups and SMEs are therefore critical for the Alliance and our defence capabilities.”", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"outpace\", \"tech\", \"turning\", \"alliance\", \"security\", \"startups\", \"rivals\", \"diana\", \"technology\", \"test\", \"nato\", \"defence\", \"hiranidriver\", \"innovation\"]", "content_hash": "797a118952b9b6d0eb6ef1743d7f5e1a58b214c56c44642b08a5dd67b27e413b", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:24.222826+00:00"}

The attackers, wearing balaclavas, forced him into a van, later severing one of his fingers and sending a video of the mutilation to his son alongside a demand for millions of euros in ransom.\n\nThe incident joined a growing list of violent crimes in France linked to crypto wealth. Victims have included a prominent entrepreneur and his wife who were held hostage, a man doused in petrol, and a child targeted in an attempted abduction.\n\nAs fear spreads within France’s crypto community, some industry figures are accusing the EU’s landmark digital asset regulations of exposing holders to greater risk. Their concerns centre on the transparency requirements, which could make it easier to track down crypto owners. However, other insiders argue that the EU rules make a convenient scapegoat.\n\nStanislas Barthélemi, president of the French crypto lobbying group ADAN, told the New York Times this week that the rules may inadvertently have put holders in danger. By creating a traceable digital footprint, he said, criminals could potentially monitor blockchain activity to identify wealthy targets.\n\nAlexandre Stachchenko, director of strategy at French crypto exchange Paymium, echoed the concern. He said the industry “wants to be discrete and anonymous,” but EU law “tells us it’s criminal.”\n\nYet others in the industry dispute the claim that the EU’s regulations have played a role in the surge in attacks.\n\n‘Strategic deflection’\n\nMarit Rødevand, CEO & co-founder of Norwegian anti-money laundering firm Strise, said there was “little evidence” of a connection between the union’s rules and crypto kidnappings.\n\n“While it is easy for champions of crypto to postulate that the increased physical attacks on those operating in the space are a product of regulations, this is both reductive and a strategic deflection away from legitimate security concerns,” she said.\n\nAccording to Rødevand, it is just as likely that information about potential targets was accessed through hacks, social media exposure, or publicity. Many crypto entrepreneurs are also prominent influencers.\n\nChristopher Whitehouse, a crypto expert and solicitor at London-based law firm RPC, also made no connection. Instead, he said those holding high amounts of cryptocurrency were “obvious targets.”\n\n“The recent surge in crypto-motivated kidnappings in France is alarming but not surprising,” Whitehouse told TNW.\n\nHe noted that cryptocurrencies have several features that make them attractive for ransom. They can be transferred instantly, are difficult to trace if moved by sophisticated criminals, and lack the safeguards of traditional bank accounts. Traditional currency, in contrast, can be tracked via serial numbers.\n\nExploiting human vulnerability\n\nThe recent violence in France, while brutal, is also not anything new. According to data compiled by crypto security advocate Jameson Lopp, over 200 physical attacks against Bitcoin and cryptocurrency holders have been reported since 2014. Some have been fatal.\n\nMatt Green, head of blockchain technology disputes at London law firm Lawrence Stephens, contends that the violence boils down to criminals exploiting the weakest link in the crypto chain: people.\n\n“The only thing stopping criminals [from] gaining access is human error or force, so kidnapping aims to break down the integrity of that human-led security,” he told TNW.\n\nTo protect themselves, some high-wealth crypto holders have beefed up their personal security, including hiring bodyguards.\n\nGreen suggests another layer of protection: multisignature wallets, a type of crypto wallet that requires multiple users to perform certain tasks, such as making transfers.\n\nJust as some shops display signs saying no cash is kept on premises, crypto holders would do well to make it clear that a single individual cannot access funds, Green said.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"industry\", \"crypto\", \"little\", \"criminals\", \"aided\", \"security\", \"rules\", \"told\", \"holders\", \"kidnappings\", \"regulations\", \"eu\", \"law\", \"laws\", \"evidence\", \"france\"]", "content_hash": "615d2c870b9f824f32021df9c88bfed106d8baf1af98d37a5eb716c0e5f54217", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:25.065636+00:00"}

The runner-up, Google’s Gemini, is banned by 9.2%.\n\nGrok has been under the spotlight recently for a string of blunders. They include spreading false claims about a “white genocide” in South Africa and raising doubts about Holocaust facts.\n\nSuch mishaps have raised concerns about Grok’s security and privacy controls. The report said the chatbot is frequently blocked in favour of “more secure or better-aligned alternatives.”\n\nNeil Thacker, Netskope’s global privacy and data protection officer, said the bans underscore a broader trend in how European organisations use popular GenAI tools.\n\n“Businesses are becoming aware that not all apps are the same in the way they handle data privacy, ownership of data that is shared with the app, or in how much detail they reveal about the way they train the model with any data that is shared within prompts,” he said.\n\nGenAI is now widely used across Europe, with 91% of organisations integrating cloud-based chatbots into their operations, the report found. Yet not all tools are welcomed equally.\n\nStable Diffusion, UK-based Stability AI’s image generator, is the most blocked AI app in Europe, barred by 41% of organisations. The app was often flagged because of concerns around privacy or licensing issues, the report found.\n\nGianpietro Cutolo, cloud threat researcher at Netskope, said organisations were gaining awareness of the risks around specific AI bots. “They’re becoming more savvy that not all AI is equal when it comes to data security,” he said.\n\nThe growing rejection of Grok comes amid a string of upsets across Musk’s empire, including turmoil at Tesla. The car firm’s sales in Europe have plummeted this year, with a 52% drop year-on-year in the EU last month.\n\nSome analysts have linked the decline to Musk’s role in the Trump administration and his open support of far-right politicians. Now, similar reputational fallout may be catching up with Grok — which Musk once called the ultimate “truth-seeking AI.”\n\nEurope’s digital future will be a hot topic at TNW Conference, where thousands of founders, investors, and corporate innovators will share their views.

An onboard computer will stream this data to a machine learning algorithm that is trained to spot patterns and potential threats.\n\nThe technology is designed to help the Danish defence forces identify threats such as enemy submarines, illegal fishing, drug smuggling, or tampering with undersea cables. The drones will also perform deep-sea mapping to give authorities a clearer perspective of the ocean floor and underwater infrastructure, such as communication cables, pipelines, and offshore energy platforms.\n\nSurveillance of this kind has become increasingly urgent since the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage, which exposed the vulnerability of underwater assets to covert attacks. Denmark is also stepping up its maritime defences in the Baltic Sea amid growing concerns over Russian aggression.\n\nThe robotic sailboats are made and operated by Saildrone, a US-based tech firm founded by British engineer Richard Jenkins in 2012. In its early days, Saildrone mainly focused on climate and weather surveying. But now the vast majority of its 140-strong fleet is deployed for defence and security purposes.\n\n“The Baltic, North Sea, and European Arctic waters are currently facing unprecedented threats,” said Jenkins. “We are very excited to be partnering with the Danish armed forces to deploy Saildrone systems to help protect Europe’s critical undersea infrastructure and increase regional security.”\n\nDenmark’s army will begin testing the four vessels in June, as part of a broader effort to beef up its high-tech defences, including deploying mine-hunting underwater drones and uncrewed surveillance aircraft.\n\nLast month, the Nordic country announced a $614mn spending package. It will use the money to procure 26 new naval vessels, more drones, and sonar equipment in response to emerging maritime threats — particularly from Russia.\n\nLast month, the company set up a Danish subsidiary in Copenhagen, which it hopes will bring the technology closer to key defence markets including the UK, France, and Germany.\n\nDefence tech is a key theme of the Assembly, the invite-only policy track of TNW Conference.

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "The Oura Ring 4 (left) has receded sensors that make it more comfortable compared to Oura Ring 3 (right). Nina Raemont/ZDNET\n\nConsidering buying an Oura Ring to track your sleep, activity, or stress? Oura is taking up to $200 off its third-gen smart ring, depending on the finish and size. This deal applies to the Oura Ring Heritage and Oura Ring Horizon, two third-generation smart rings.\n\nAlso: The Oura Ring 4 is ZDNET's best product of the year\n\nThe deal on the earlier generation Oura Ring 3 is so low because Oura recently unveiled the Oura Ring 4. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive and well-designed smart ring that blows its competitors (and even the Ring 3) out of the water. But does that mean you should buy the newer Ring 4 over the less expensive Ring 3 that's on sale right now? It all depends on what features you prioritize in a smart ring. I break down the differences below.\n\nSpecifications\n\n\n\nOura Ring 3 Oura Ring 4 Battery life Up to seven days Up to eight days Charging time Between 20-80 minutes Between 20-80 minutes Sizes 6-13 4-15 Material Titanium exterior and epoxy interior Fully titanium Finishes Black, brushed titanium, gold, silver, rose gold Black, brushed silver, gold, silver, rose gold Starting price $300 $350\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 4 if...\n\n\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You prioritize comfort\n\nOne of the highlights of the new Oura Ring 4 is its smart sensors. Oura Ring 4's smart sensing technology uses 18 signal pathways, compared to the Oura Ring 3's eight, to capture more accurate data with fewer gaps.\n\nSo, what does that have to do with comfort? These smart sensors allow the raised sensor domes that stick out on the Oura Ring 3's interior to flatten and recede on the Oura Ring 4 for a more comfortable and less constrictive wear. I wore the Oura Ring 3 for around eight months, and one of the few gripes I had with it was that the three domes would cling to the inside of my finger, resulting in dents that remained on my skin for days after.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 4 for weeks. Here's why it's the best health tracker right now\n\nThe Oura Ring 4 is far more comfortable than the Oura Ring 3 thanks to the receded smart sensing technology. It's noticeably slimmer, both on the interior of the ring and the exterior, which results in a lighter feel. If you are more sensitive to health trackers around your wrist or finger and get easily annoyed with jewelry, I'd suggest the Oura Ring 4.\n\n2. You want a smaller or larger ring size\n\nSherin Shibu\n\nExpanded sizing is one of the major hardware upgrades that came with the Oura Ring 4. Where the Oura Ring 3 offers sizes six through 13, the Oura Ring 4 offers sizes four through 15. That's four more sizes on the larger and smaller ends of the spectrum. If you couldn't buy the Oura Ring 3 because the available sizes didn't fit your finger, the Oura Ring 4 might fit you better.\n\n3. You want a longer battery life\n\nThe Oura Ring 3 boasts a battery life of up to seven days, though I normally got around four. The newer Oura Ring 4 boasts a battery life of up to eight days, but during my testing I got around 5 and a half.\n\nIf you forget to charge your tech constantly and want a smart ring that you can put on for a few days and not worry about, then I'd recommend the Oura Ring 4. If you are adamant about daily charging, however, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3.\n\nYou should buy the Oura Ring 3 if...\n\nNina Raemont/ZDNET\n\n1. You just want the newest software\n\nMost of the software updates that came to the Oura Ring 4 also are available on the Oura Ring 3. That includes automatic heart rate monitoring during workouts, the Oura app redesign, upgraded daytime stress features that help contextualize your physiological stress, and many new Oura Labs features you can test out, like meal logging.\n\nAutomatic heart rate monitoring continues Oura's mission of autonomously logging health data with little assistance from the ring wearer. This means that, on top of the automatic workout detection feature, the Oura Ring now can monitor and record your heart rate during these activities without you clicking on the Record workout HR button.\n\nAlso: I tested the Oura Ring 3 -- and it totally beat my Apple Watch\n\nOura upgraded its daytime stress feature by implementing the daily tags people use to document their meals, workouts, illnesses, and moods onto the daytime stress timeline. Let's say you just had an argument with a coworker and find that your heart rate is elevated. If you log that in the app, it will include that tag into the daytime stress timeline.\n\nLastly, there are a few experimental features Oura Ring 3 users can take advantage of through Oura Labs, which is also available on both rings. One of my favorite features I tested was the meal-logging feature that uses your camera and AI to document what you're eating (and when).\n\nThe AI was able to detect that I was eating yogurt with berries and bananas one morning, despite the yogurt being fully picked over and mixed with the other ingredients.\n\n2. You don't want to spend more money\n\nYou can buy an Oura Ring 3 for up to $200 right now. The third-generation smart ring has been on sale since Oura unveiled a newer generation. If a starting price of $350 (plus that $6 monthly subscription to access all your data) is a little too much for you, the Oura Ring 3 is substantially cheaper.\n\n3. Comfort isn't a concern\n\nIf you own an Oura Ring 3 and aren't disturbed by the raised sensors or the chunkier build, I don't see a need for you to upgrade to the Oura Ring 4. If you don't own either ring and are trying to make a buying decision, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3 if you are unbothered by a tight and raised dome around your finger.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"right\", \"sizes\", \"oura\", \"vs\", \"opt\", \"discounted\", \"stress\", \"newest\", \"ring\", \"features\", \"buy\", \"older\", \"days\", \"smart\", \"sensors\"]", "content_hash": "8bfe6d67475ef7abdc53eeb95171bbca33677b332ccb0bbadccb85f08b2f9891", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:39.080330+00:00"}

Amazon Echo speakers are the best way to bring Alexa into your smart home. The Echo Pop and Echo Dot, Amazon's two most compact smart speakers, are the most popular and affordable Echo devices available.\n\nAmazon's new Alexa+ is launching gradually over the next few weeks. While the company is prioritizing the larger Echo Shows in the initial release, Amazon says that after you get access to Alexa+ on an Echo Show 8,10,15, or 21, it will be available on all of your Echo devices, with the exception of some older generations.\n\nAlso: Amazon just gave Alexa its biggest upgrade in a decade - and old Echo devices will support it\n\nThe Echo Pop is newer than the Echo Dot and is marketed as the company's most compact speaker. At about two-thirds of the size of the already compact Echo Dot, the Echo Pop is best suited for small rooms and can be tucked away in the corner of a desk. The slightly larger Echo Dot is about the size of an Apple HomePod mini and delivers more potent sound.\n\nRead on to learn more about how the Echo Pop and Echo Dot compare and which is best suited for which sort of user.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Pop if...\n\n\n\nHere's an Amazon Echo Pop next to an Apple Magic Mouse, for reference. Maria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need a compact speaker\n\nThe Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and most affordable smart speaker, perfect for a small room -- such as a dorm or a kid's room. Because it doesn't feature a screen and can go unnoticed, it's a simple way to introduce yourself to the Alexa ecosystem or give someone access to Amazon's voice assistant in a simple, unintimidating way.\n\nReview: Amazon Echo Pop review: A portable smart speaker for small spaces\n\nThe Echo Pop is a perfect option if you're looking for a compact speaker for your kid's desk, a guest room, or an area you don't use often. It can be unreliable in larger rooms or when tasked with bigger assignments, which brings me to my next point.\n\n2. You plan on everyday music streaming, podcasts, or audiobooks\n\nThe Echo Pop is surprisingly loud, but the sound quality decreases greatly when the volume increases. This is why the Echo Pop is meant for smaller rooms and is much less expensive than other Echo devices.\n\nAlso: The best smart home devices\n\nThe Echo Pop won't be the life of the party at a backyard barbecue. Still, it's excellent for listening to music informally when hanging out in your room, catching up on your favorite podcasts, and listening to audiobooks. Having Alexa built-in makes it more enticing, as you can use the AI-powered voice assistant to control smart devices around your home.\n\nYou should buy the Echo Dot if...\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\n1. You need Alexa to be more reliable\n\nBecause the Echo Pop is a smaller, more affordable smart speaker than the Echo Dot, it's also less reliable. The Echo Dot is more responsive and can easily hear me from across the room, whether it's playing music or not.\n\nThe Echo Pop, in turn, appears to have a simpler microphone array that is easily overpowered by high volumes. I've often found Alexa unable to hear me on the Echo Pop when the volume is too high, which can be frustrating, especially because it doesn't have an action button.\n\nAlso: Here's how to use Alexa Plus for free - especially if you're an Amazon Prime member\n\nThe Echo Dot features a volume-up button, a volume-down button, a mute button, and an action button. The last one is a great way to wake Alexa without talking to it, which would be nice in the Echo Pop when it can't hear me. I've resorted to unplugging the Echo Pop when it can't hear me, so it stops blasting \"The Wheels on the Bus.\"\n\n2. You want room-filling sound\n\nThe Echo Dot isn't a high-end speaker, but it is great for most users. It can deliver room-filling sound from a small package, as the audio doesn't deteriorate as much as the Echo Pop's when the volume goes up. For example, you can pair two Echo Dots to function as external speakers for a TV and get stereo sound better than audio from most inexpensive TVs.\n\nAlso: Not all Echo devices will get Alexa Plus - see if yours made the list\n\nAs a device often discounted during Prime Day and holiday sales events for around half off, I'd recommend the Echo Dot to most users looking for a reliable smart speaker with Alexa built-in that can deliver sound from all directions.\n\nAlternatives to consider", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"amazon\", \"choose\", \"speaker\", \"vs\", \"room\", \"alexa\", \"compact\", \"dot\", \"pop\", \"smart\", \"echo\", \"devices\"]", "content_hash": "98bade5b9872cfa69029fa4b6b1d966decd58db1114183116401f58f5ba92fcd", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:40.042015+00:00"}

You can instantly sign up for its free plan and build your first campaign. With step-by-step buttons on its dashboard, like importing or creating your contact list, connecting an integration, and importing your brand persona, your first round of emails or SMS campaign will be ready in no time.\n\nHere, you can either start from scratch or use a campaign template. The drag-and-drop editor makes the entire setup process easy, though the free templates are pretty barebones unless you upgrade. The automation builder can trigger emails based on sign-ups, tags, events, or custom criteria you set. I tested both prebuilt and custom journeys, and while it takes a few minutes to learn the flow, it's flexible and powerful once you do. That said, were discontinued in mid-2025 by Mailchimp, so if you're coming back to the platform after a while, expect to rebuild from scratch and pay for something that used to be free.\n\nMoreover, Mailchimp's dashboard actually recommends flows based on common goals like welcoming new contacts, sharing content with Meta leads, or sending birthday discounts. These flows save serious time for basic tasks like recovering abandoned carts or nurturing repeat buyers. The thing is, on the Free plan, you can preview them, but you'll need to upgrade to actually launch them. Still, it's nice to see what's possible before committing. Setting up a flow is visual, i.e., more drag-and-drop than techy, which makes it approachable, even if you've never done automation before. Once you understand how triggers and actions work together, you can build out surprisingly complex sequences.\n\nPlans start free with 500 contacts, then scale based on list size. Paid plans include Essentials (from $13 per month), Standard (from $20 per month), and Premium (from $350 per month for 10,000+ contacts). So, if you're working with a small list, the Free or Essentials plan might be enough. You can also buy credits with a Pay As You Go plan if you send your emails occasionally. Free trials run for 14 days on Standard or Essentials, and nonprofits get a 15% discount.\n\nMailchimp features: Email + SMS campaign builder | Prebuilt automation flows | List segmentation and tagging | Signup forms and popups | Landing page builder | 250+ integrations | 14-day free trial on paid plans", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"marketing\", \"software\", \"plan\", \"free\", \"essentials\", \"contacts\", \"email\", \"tested\", \"best\", \"month\", \"youre\", \"expert\", \"2025\", \"list\", \"emails\", \"campaign\", \"flows\"]", "content_hash": "6ab1779854ac6e9ac8fd94d43862867b950ebad44936b3034e2eec155729ca68", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:42.730808+00:00"}

You can use HubSpot for a variety of tasks, such as organizing and managing marketing, customer contact records, website development, and customer support, among many other use cases.

Though the overall classifications of different types of CRM software vary from vendor to vendor, the same themes appear. You may want to research the major types of CRM before you make a purchase decision, as that may influence how your business grows. Operational: Most modern CRM platforms offer some kind of operational mechanism or module. Operational CRMs tend to focus on optimizing business operations, including sales processes, logistics, and customer communications. Operational CRMs may be particularly useful for startups and small and midsize businesses looking to scale. Analytical/data-driven: Other CRMs focus on the intrinsic value of data. Businesses able to handle, securely store, and analyze customer data -- always useful if held in a centralized, organized platform -- can draw insights and see patterns that may influence their future sales activities or reveal new revenue streams. Furthermore, data-driven CRMs may reveal ways to improve customer relationships and retention. Collaborative: Collaborative CRMs provide organizations with a way to enhance collaboration and productivity. CRM suites can be used to create department channels and data repositories, allowing different teams to work together and to share information. For instance, a sales team could collaborate with marketing and finance to create new customer promotions and campaigns. Customer service teams, too, can access important records to track customer journeys and resolve issues.

Below are some basic recommendations for integrating your new CRM software effectively: Plan and assess: Research and assess the needs of your business and whether the CRM solution you're considering will provide a return on your investment. Consider the type of CRM you need, your primary reason for using a CRM, how many seats you'll need, and whether you need collaborative functions to integrate the CRM with different departments, such as marketing or customer service.\n\nResearch and assess the needs of your business and whether the CRM solution you're considering will provide a return on your investment.

Existing systems: Consider whether there are existing, legacy systems that the CRM will replace. If there are apps you want the CRM to integrate with, you may also need to check compatibility requirements and support. It may also be important to create new policies, especially around data and security.\n\nConsider whether there are existing, legacy systems that the CRM will replace.

With just a few clicks, we can dive into endless entertainment -- but that ease comes with a downside: the buildup of cache data.\n\nAlso: How to disable ACR on your TV (and why doing so makes such a big difference)\n\nJust like on your phone or computer, a cluttered TV cache can lead to sluggish performance, app crashes, and even hinder new content from loading properly. That's why it's important to clear all that extra cache and make your TV feel like new again. Before I break down the steps for how to do it, let's address the big elephant in the room first.\n\nWhat is a cache?\n\nA cache is a temporary storage area where data is kept for quick access. On your smart TV, the cache stores information from apps, websites, and system processes to help them load faster every time you turn it on. Think of it as a bunch of temporary files intended to speed up loading times for frequently accessed information.\n\nAlso: The best TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nFor instance, when you open a streaming app, the cache might store thumbnails, login details, or recently watched shows. Caches are designed to help your TV load this content more quickly. Over time, however, the cache can become overloaded with outdated or unnecessary data, which can consequently slow down your TV's performance.\n\nWhy should you clear your TV's cache?\n\nYou should consider clearing your TV's cache for two main reasons. First, it can improve performance. A bloated cache can slow down your TV's processing, leading to sluggish navigation, delayed app launches, and buffering issues. Clearing the cache frees up space and allows your TV to run more efficiently.\n\nSecond, clearing the cache can resolve app-specific problems. If you're experiencing issues like crashes, login errors, or unexpected behavior within a particular app, clearing the cache for that specific app can often be the fix.\n\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested\n\nThe process of clearing your TV's cache will vary depending on the brand and model you own, although the general steps are usually quite similar across brands. Most TVs will have a settings menu where you can navigate to an \"Apps\" section. Here, you should find a list of all downloaded applications. Selecting an individual app will often reveal options to \"Clear Cache\" or \"Clear Data.\" Clearing the cache will remove temporary files, while clearing data will erase all app information, requiring you to log in again.\n\nIt's generally recommended to start with clearing the cache and only resort to clearing data if the problem persists.\n\nAlso: I changed 10 settings on my Fire TV to instantly improve the performance\n\nIf you're unsure about the specific steps for your TV, a quick online search for your model and \"clear cache\" should provide you with detailed instructions. Most manufacturers also offer user manuals or online support resources that can guide you through the process.\n\nClearing your TV's cache can offer several benefits:\n\nImproved performance: Over time, cached data can accumulate and slow down your TV's operations. Increased storage space: Clearing the cache frees up valuable storage space on your TV. Resolved app issues: Sometimes, apps may malfunction due to corrupted cached data. Clearing the cache can often fix these problems. Enhanced privacy: Cached data may contain personal information, so regular clearing can help protect your privacy.\n\nHow do I clear the cache on my TV?\n\nThe process of clearing your TV's cache can vary depending on the brand and model. However, here's a general guide that applies to many smart TVs:\n\nAccess the Settings menu on your TV. Navigate to the Apps or Application Manager section. Select the app for which you want to clear the cache. Look for an option that says \"Clear Cache\" and select it.\n\nBelow is a list of specific cache-clearing instructions for some leading brands.\n\nFor Samsung TVs:\n\nGo to Settings > Support > Device Care Select \"Manage Storage\" Choose the app you want to clear the cache for and select \"View Details\" Select \"Clear Cache\"\n\nAlso: 5 easy ways to instantly improve your soundbar's audio (without spending a dime)\n\nFor LG TVs:\n\nPress the Home button on your remote Go to Settings > General > Storage Select \"Clear Cache\"\n\nFor Android/Google TVs (including Sony models):\n\nGo to Settings > Apps Select \"See all apps\" Choose the app you want to clear the cache for Select \"Clear Cache\"\n\nFor Roku TVs:\n\nRoku TVs don't have a built-in cache-clearing option, but you can achieve similar results by restarting the TV or removing and reinstalling problematic apps.\n\nAlso: Is your Roku TV spying on you? Likely, but here's how you can take back control\n\nSome key points to note:\n\nThe exact menu names and options may vary slightly between TV models and software versions.\n\nYou may need to clear the cache for individual apps rather than the entire system on some TVs.\n\nClearing your cache is generally safe and won't delete important data, but clearing app data may reset some settings.\n\nBe sure to consult your TV's user manual for model-specific instructions, as the process can differ between brands and even between models of the same brand.\n\nWhen should you clear your TV's cache?\n\nWhile there's no strict rule, it's a good practice to clear your TV's cache every few months or when you notice:\n\nYour TV is running slower than usual.\n\nApps are frequently crashing or not loading properly.\n\nYou're running low on storage space.\n\nAlso: Can't hear TV dialogue? Changing these 3 settings can make a big difference\n\nTaking a few minutes to clear your cache is a simple yet often overlooked task that can improve your smart TV's performance and ensure a smooth viewing experience. By making this a regular part of your TV maintenance routine, you can enjoy faster load times, more stable app performance, and potentially even extend the life of your device. With a clean slate, your TV can operate smoother, apps can function properly, and you can get back to enjoying your favorite content without any frustrating glitches.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"greatly\", \"settings\", \"improves\", \"tv\", \"clearing\", \"app\", \"data\", \"cache\", \"apps\", \"clear\", \"tvs\", \"performance\", \"select\"]", "content_hash": "e0ae010bb854a5f799ec0a1535aa4b2ee6af10c897d69c66a0fe4a4da90ae459", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:45.967818+00:00"}

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Dragon Claws/Getty Images\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nOn Oct. 14, 2025, Microsoft will stop delivering security updates to your Windows 10 PC unless you enroll that PC in the Extended Security Updates program.\n\nIf you try to upgrade to Windows 11 on a PC that's more than five or six years old, you'll probably encounter an error message telling you -- in no uncertain terms -- that your old PC doesn't qualify because its CPU isn't on the official list of compatible processors. Microsoft has stated, forcefully, that it will not revise those requirements. You will also hit roadblocks if your PC doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, or if the TPM is not enabled.\n\nAlso: Two ways to get free Windows 10 security updates through October 2026\n\nThat might be the official policy, but -- as with everything Windows-related -- it pays to read the fine print.\n\nThose pesky restrictions prevent you from automatically upgrading to Windows 11 using Windows Update or the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Yet, as I detail in ZDNET's Windows 11 FAQ, there are documented workarounds for most PCs that were originally built for Windows 10.\n\nOver the past few years, Microsoft has played a cat-and-mouse game with enthusiasts, adding occasional speed bumps that make it more difficult to bypass these compatibility checks. There are workarounds for most modern PCs, but some older devices, especially those built using AMD processors, might be out of luck. The instructions below take all those developments into account.\n\nAlso: Can your old PC handle the Windows 11 upgrade? How to find out - before you try\n\nThese instructions also assume that you have a PC running a retail or OEM edition of Windows 10 (Home or Pro) and that you are signed in as an administrator on the PC you want to upgrade.\n\nWhich option should you choose?\n\nPlease don't skip over this section.\n\nThis article describes two upgrade options. To take advantage of the workaround described in option 1 below, your computer must meet all the other requirements for Windows 11.\n\nIt must be configured to start up using UEFI, not a legacy BIOS configuration.\n\nSecure Boot must be supported, although it does not need to be enabled. (But seriously, folks, you should enable Secure Boot.)\n\nA TPM must be enabled; version 1.2 is OK, but a system without any TPM or with the TPM disabled will fail. Any PC that was originally designed for Windows 10 should include a TPM 2.0.\n\nTo check these details on a PC you're considering upgrading, run the System Information utility, Msinfo32.exe, and look at the System Summary page. Pay special attention to the BIOS Mode value. If it says \"Legacy,\" you'll need to reconfigure your system to UEFI mode (and convert your system disk from MBR to GPT partitioning) before you can install Windows 11 as a normal upgrade.\n\nAlso: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how to get around it\n\nTo see whether your PC has a TPM enabled, run the Trusted Platform Module Management tool, Tpm.msc. If your computer includes a TPM and it's turned on, this app will display information about it. Under the TPM Manufacturer Information heading, check the specification version to confirm that it is 2.0. If there's no TPM, or if the TPM is disabled in firmware settings, you'll see a message that says \"Compatible TPM cannot be found.\"\n\nIf you're unable (or unwilling) to change from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, or if you have an older PC that doesn't have a TPM option at all, you'll need to use the second option, which takes advantage of an undocumented hack that allows you to bypass the compatibility checks and complete the upgrade. Skip to the Option 2 section of this post for details on how to use the free Rufus utility to perform this upgrade.\n\nAlso: How to install Windows 11 your way (and avoid Microsoft's restrictions)\n\nFinally, note that Microsoft added a new set of restrictions as part of the Windows 11 version 24H2 update. These changes require a CPU that supports specific instructions -- SSE4.2 and PopCnt. Most PCs with Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will meet this standard. AMD CPUs from 2013 or later should also meet these requirements. But it is impossible to upgrade to Windows 11 version 24H2 on a PC that was built in 2008 or earlier. For details, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that.\"\n\nIf you plan to perform a clean installation of Windows 11, you can boot from installation media and run Windows Setup. That option skips the CPU compatibility check completely (but still requires a TPM and Secure Boot support). After the installation completes, you'll need to reinstall all your apps, restore your data files, and tweak settings to personalize your system preferences.\n\nWant to avoid all that hassle? Choose the option that's appropriate for your hardware.\n\nOption 1: Use this simple registry edit\n\nWith this registry edit, you can bypass CPU checks and accept any TPM version. Please be aware that this option requires that you run the Setup program from within your current Windows installation. You can't boot from a USB flash drive and install Windows 11 this way.\n\nThis process requires four steps.\n\n1. Change one key in the Windows registry You need to make one small change to the Windows registry. For more than three years, this change was documented at Microsoft's support website, but the company removed those instructions in December 2024. (Here's an archived version of that support article.) This change tells the Windows 11 Setup program to skip the check for compatible CPUs and to allow installation on a PC with an older TPM (version 1.2). The usual warnings apply when working with the registry; I recommend you make a complete backup before proceeding. Open Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup\\MoSetup If the MoSetup key doesn't exist, you need to create it. Right-click the node for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\Setup in the left-hand navigation pane, then choose New > Key. Name it MoSetup and press Enter. Also: Wiping your Windows laptop? Here's the simplest way to erase all personal data Select the MoSetup key and then right-click in any empty space in the pane on the right. Choose the option to create a new DWORD value. (Don't choose the QWORD option!) Replace the default name for that key by typing the text AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU and then press Enter. Then double-click the new value and change the \"Value data\" box to 1. The result should look like this: Show more\n\nUse this registry tweak to override the Windows 11 CPU compatibility check. You must have a TPM (any version) and Secure Boot must be enabled. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nCheck for typos before proceeding -- Windows is frustratingly literal about the contents of the registry, and if you misspell the key or value name, your upgrade will fail. Click OK to save your change, and then restart your PC.\n\n2. Download the Windows 11 ISO On the PC you want to upgrade, go to the Windows 11 Download page (aka.ms/DownloadWindows11) and choose the option at the bottom of the page, \"Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices.\" Save the ISO file in your Downloads folder. Note that this is a big file. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, the download could take a while. Also: The ultimate Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything you need to know For those running Windows with English (UK) as the selected language, choose English (United States) when prompted for a product language. Several readers have reported that choosing English International results in an upgrade that does not allow you to keep installed apps and data files. Show more\n\n3. Mount the ISO file in File Explorer After the download completes, open File Explorer and double-click the ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Doing so mounts the file as a virtual DVD drive in its own folder, with its own drive letter. Show more\n\n4. Run Windows Setup In File Explorer, find the Setup.exe file in the virtual drive you opened in the previous step and double-click it to begin the upgrade. You'll see a stern warning about compatibility issues and the possibility that performing an upgrade will mean you are not entitled to future updates. You can safely click Accept to move past this message. (For details on what that warning message really means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\" Spoiler: They are not going to cut off security updates.) After you click OK on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues. If you're upgrading from the same edition (Home or Pro), you'll have three options: You can keep your apps, settings, and files (Full Upgrade); keep your data files but start fresh with apps and settings (Keep Data Only); or start completely fresh (Clean Install). Show more\n\nOption 2: Use the free Rufus utility\n\nOn older PCs without a TPM and on PCs that don't support Secure Boot, you'll need to use an undocumented hack to bypass the compatibility checker. You can do this manually by replacing the Appraiserres.dll file (in the Sources subfolder on the Windows 11 installer drive) with a zero-byte version and then making a series of registry edits. But it's simpler to use the free, open-source Rufus utility to create installation media (on a USB flash) drive that includes these tweaks automatically.\n\nTo get started, download Rufus version 4.6 or later. Earlier versions won't work, thanks to changes Microsoft made in October 2024 to its compatibility checking tools. For details of how the newer versions work, see \"Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This just-released tool can get the job done.\" In addition, be aware that using Rufus will not allow you to bypass the new restrictions on very old PCs that were introduced with Windows 11 version 24H2.\n\nIf you have a PC with a CPU that lacks support for SSE4.2 and PopCnt instructions, not even Rufus can help. (Of course, any PC that fails that test is nearly 20 years old and probably deserves to be retired.)\n\nAlso: Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it\n\nTo get started, you'll need to download the Windows 11 ISO. Be sure to save it to the Downloads folder of your Windows system drive so you can find it easily. You'll also need a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB in size. You will reformat this drive as part of the process, so back up any data on that drive first -- and do not store the Windows 11 ISO here!\n\nDownload Rufus from the developer's site from the Microsoft Store Choose the USB drive and then choose the \"Disk or ISO image\" option. Click the Select button, choose the Windows 11 ISO you downloaded earlier, and then click Start. In the Windows User Experience dialog, select the first checkbox to remove hardware requirements, as shown in the screenshot below. Click OK to begin creating the drive.\n\nBe sure to choose the top checkbox here to bypass the compatibility check for the Windows 11 upgrade. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET\n\nAfter Rufus successfully creates your installer, open that USB drive in File Explorer, and double-click Setup. Do not try to upgrade by booting from that USB drive and performing a clean install; it won't work.\n\nAs is the case with the other option, you'll see a warning about compatibility issues. It's a scare tactic. (For details on what the language in that warning message actually means, see \"Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?\") After you click Accept on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.\n\nAlso: Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that\n\nMy ZDNET colleague Lance Whitney has more details on the other options available with Rufus in \"How to install Windows 11 the way you want (and bypass Microsoft's restrictions).\"\n\nDid your upgrade work?\n\nIf you've tried this upgrade, I want to hear about your experience.

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Adam Breeden/ZDNET\n\nDid you know that whenever you turn on your smart TV, you invite an unseen guest to watch it with you?\n\nThese days, most popular TV models utilize automatic content recognition (ACR), a form of ad surveillance technology that gathers information about everything you watch and transmits it to a centralized database. Manufacturers then use your data to identify your viewing preferences, enabling them to deliver highly targeted ads.\n\nAlso: Your TV's USB port is seriously underutilized: 5 features you're not taking advantage of\n\nWhat's the incentive behind this invasive technology? According to market research firm eMarketer, in 2022, advertisers spent an estimated $18.6 billion on smart TV ads, and those numbers are only going up.\n\nTo understand how ACR works, imagine a constant, real-time Shazam-like service running in the background while your TV is on. It identifies content displayed on your screen, including programs from cable TV boxes, streaming services, or gaming consoles. ACR does this by capturing continuous screenshots and cross-referencing them with a vast database of media content and advertisements.\n\nAccording to The Markup, ACR can capture and identify up to 7,200 images per hour, or approximately two images every second. This extensive tracking offers money-making insights for marketers and content distributors because it can reveal connections between viewers' personal information and their preferred content. By \"personal information,\" I mean email addresses, IP addresses -- and even your physical street address.\n\nBy understanding what viewers watch and engage with, marketers can make decisions on content recommendations to create bespoke advertising placements. They can also track advertisements that lead to purchases.\n\nAlso: The fastest VPNs of 2025: Great speeds and secure connections anywhere\n\nBut the most disturbing part is the potential for exploitation. In the wrong hands, sensitive information gathered through ACR could be exploited or misused, which may result in security risks or, at worst, identity theft.\n\nBecause ACR operates clandestinely in the background, many of us aren't even aware of its active presence each time we're enjoying our favorite shows. Opting out of using ACR is complex and sometimes challenging. Navigating through your TV settings might take several dozen clicks to protect your privacy better.\n\nIf you, like me, perceive this feature to be intrusive or unsettling, there's a way to dismiss this data collection feature on your smart TV. It might take some patience, but below is a How-To list for five major brands demonstrating how to turn off ACR.\n\nHow to turn off ACR on a smart TV\n\nFor Samsung TVs… Press the Home button on your remote control. Navigate to the left to access the sidebar menu. In the sidebar menu, choose the Privacy Choices option. Select the Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy option. Ensure that the checkbox for Viewing Information Services is unchecked. This will turn off ACR and any associated ad targeting. Select the OK option at the bottom of the screen to confirm your changes. Show more\n\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated benefit that can revitalize an old system - here's how it works\n\nFor an LG TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the home screen. Press the Settings button on your remote. In the settings side menu, select the Settings option. Navigate to and select the General option. In the General menu, choose System. Select Additional Settings. In Additional Settings, locate and toggle off the Live Plus option. LG further allows you to limit ad tracking, which can be found in Additional Settings. In the Additional Settings menu, select Advertisement. Toggle on the Limit AD Tracking option. You can also turn off home promotions and content recommendations: In the Additional Settings menu, select Home Settings. Uncheck the Home Promotion option. Uncheck the Content Recommendation option. Show more\n\nFor a Sony TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu. Navigate to and select Settings. Choose Initial Setup. Scroll down and select Samba Interactive TV. Select Disable to turn off Samba TV, which is Sony's ACR technology. Sony also allows for enhanced privacy by disabling ad personalization: Go to Settings. Select About. Choose Ads. Turn off Ads Personalization. As an extra step, you can entirely disable the Samba Services Manager, which is embedded in the firmware of certain Sony Bravia TVs as a third-party interactive app. Go to Settings. Select Apps. Select Samba Services Manager. Choose Clear Cache. Select Force Stop. Finally, select Disable. If your Sony TV uses Android TV, you should also turn off data collection for Chromecast: Open the Google Home app on your smartphone. Tap the Menu icon. Select your TV from the list of devices. Tap the three dots in the upper right corner. Choose Settings. Turn off Send Chromecast device usage data and crash reports. Show more\n\nFor a Hisense TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu. Navigate to and select Settings. Choose System. Select Privacy. Look for an option called Smart TV Experience, Viewing Information Services, or something similar. Toggle this option off to disable ACR. To disable personalized ads and opt out of content recommendations: In the Privacy menu, look for an option like Ad Tracking or Interest-Based Ads. Turn this option off. Look for options related to content recommendations or personalized content. Disable these features if you don't want the TV to suggest content based on your viewing habits. Show more\n\nFor a TCL TV (and other Roku-powered TVs)… Press the Home button on your TCL TV remote control. Navigate to and select Settings in the main menu. Scroll down and select the Privacy option. Look for Smart TV Experience and select it. Uncheck or toggle off the option labeled Use Info from TV Inputs. For extra privacy, TCL TVs offer a few more options, all of which can be found in the Privacy menu: Select Advertising. Choose Limit ad tracking. Again, select Advertising. Uncheck Personalized ads. Now, still in the Privacy menu, select Microphone. Adjust Channel Microphone Access and Channel Permissions as desired. Show more\n\nRemember that while these steps will significantly reduce data collection, they may also limit some smart features of your TV. Also, it's a good idea to periodically check these settings to ensure they remain as you've set them. Especially after software updates, your revised settings may sometimes revert to their default state.\n\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your TV (and why it makes such a big difference)\n\nThe driving force behind targeted advertisements on smart TVs is ACR technology, and its inclusion speaks volumes about manufacturers' focus on monetizing user data rather than prioritizing consumer interests.\n\nFor most of us, ACR offers few tangible benefits, while the real-time sharing of our viewing habits and preferences exposes us to potential privacy risks. By disabling ACR, you can help keep your data to yourself, and enjoy viewing with some peace of mind.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"acr\", \"settings\", \"tv\", \"wait\", \"menu\", \"option\", \"content\", \"privacy\", \"smart\", \"turn\", \"shouldnt\", \"select\"]", "content_hash": "090a923e29d17e0d7cb422fe7429b5db13bb111a5282f61f8b486f8ce7a5bf93", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:48.257513+00:00"}

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "What is cache?\n\nCache -- or browser cache -- is the temporary storage of website files. So, things like images, scripts, and cookies that your browser saves on your phone to make pages load faster the next time you visit.\n\nAlso: Every iPhone model that can be updated to iOS 26 (and which ones don't support it)\n\nOver time, though, those files can add up, taking a large bite out of your device storage and slowing things down. That's why it's smart to clear your browser cache regularly. In this article, I focused on clearing Safari and Chrome's cache on an iPhone, but keep in mind that apps and even your phone's processor have their own caches, too.\n\nHow to clear your app cache on iPhone\n\nYou can clear an app's cache by deleting and reinstalling it -- or, when available, using an in-app \"Clear Cache\" option. Since iOS doesn't offer a universal cache-clearing tool, each app handles it differently. TikTok and CapCut include a built-in cache-clear button, Amazon lets you erase your browsing history, and Reddit offers a way to wipe local history. It depends on an app's features.\n\nIs 'clear cache' the same as offloading?\n\nNot quite. Offloading an app via your iPhone's settings can boost performance when your storage is tight by uninstalling the app and keeping its documents and data intact. Just go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage, tap the app you want, and choose Offload App. This removes the app and its cache but leaves your data in place, so when you reinstall it, you'll pick up right where you left off.\n\nAre cookies and cache the same thing?\n\nCache and cookies are not the same.\n\nCache stores copies of images, scripts, and other page elements so sites load faster on your next visit, while cookies are small data files that remember specific information about you -- like login credentials, site preferences, or items in your shopping cart.\n\nAlso: Cookie pop-ups don't have to be a fact of life online - how I block them and why\n\nClearing your cache removes those saved page files but won't log you out of sites, whereas deleting cookies will wipe your saved logins and settings, forcing you to sign in again and reset any preferences.\n\nCan you block cookies on an iPhone?\n\nYou can block cookies in Safari. Turning them off stops sites from tracking you, but it can also break some websites or limit features. So, you'll need to weigh privacy against usability. If you'd like to block cookies in Safari, follow these steps:\n\nGo to Settings and select Safari. Tap on the toggle next to Block All Cookies.\n\nThere are also third-party extensions -- such as Ghostery and Disconnect -- that help you block cookies and trackers in Chrome.\n\nHow to check your iPhone's storage\n\nYour iPhone's Settings can show you what's eating up your storage, whether it's photos, videos, music, or even an app's temporary data. To see a full breakdown of your storage usage, follow these steps:\n\nGo to the iPhone's Settings. Tap on General. Select iPhone Storage. Scroll through to find the app you're looking for. Tap on the app to view storage status and options.\n\nAlso: Does your iPhone have enough space? How to find out\n\nUnfortunately, you can't clear a third-party app's cache directly in Settings, but this view gives you a clear breakdown of your storage and lets you delete or offload apps.\n\nHow to browse on Safari without creating a history\n\nIf you're learning how to clear the cache on an iPhone, you might wonder if there's a way to use Safari without saving any browsing history. Yes! You can turn on Private Browsing by following these steps:\n\nOpen Safari. Tap on Tabs.

{"url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-chatgpt-actually-works-and-why-its-been-so-game-changing/", "title": "How ChatGPT actually works (and why it's been so game-changing)", "authors": "[\"David Gewirtz\", \"Senior Contributing Editor\", \"July\", \"At P.M. Pt\", \"Elyse Betters Picaro\"]", "published": null, "text": "Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET\n\nBack in the day (and by \"in the day,\" I mean late 2022, before AI chatbots exploded on the scene), tools like Google and Wolfram Alpha interacted with users via a single-line text entry field and provided text results. Google returned search results -- a list of web pages and articles that would (hopefully) provide information related to the search queries. Wolfram Alpha generally provided answers that were mathematical and data analysis-related.\n\nChatGPT, by contrast, provides a response based on the context and intent behind a user's question. Google, of course, has changed up its response mode. It now provides AI-based responses before search results, and it's likely to continue to do so. Wolfram Alpha, on the other hand, uses AI behind the scenes to help it with its calculations but does not provide AI-based answers.\n\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT: A beginner's guide to the most popular AI chatbot\n\nFundamentally, Google's searching power is its ability to do enormous database lookups and provide a series of matches. Wolfram Alpha's power is its ability to parse data-related questions and perform calculations.\n\nChatGPT's power (and that of almost any other AI chatbot, like Claude, Copilot, Perplexity, and Google Gemini) is the ability to parse queries and produce fully fleshed-out answers and results based on most of the world's digitally accessible text-based information. Some chatbots have restrictions based on when they stopped scanning information, but most can now access the live Internet to factor current data into their answers.\n\nIn this article, we'll see how ChatGPT can produce those fully fleshed-out answers using a technology called generative artificial intelligence. We'll start by looking at the main phases of ChatGPT operation, then cover some core AI architecture components that make it all work.\n\nThe two main phases of ChatGPT operation\n\nLet's use Google Search (as distinguished from Google Gemini AI) as an analogy again. When you ask Google Search to look up something, you probably know that it doesn't -- at the moment you ask -- go out and scour the entire web for answers. Instead, Google searches its database for pages that match that request. Google search has two main phases: the spidering and data-gathering phase, and the user interaction/lookup phase.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT and other fun alternatives to try\n\nRoughly speaking, ChatGPT and the other AI chatbots work the same way. The data-gathering phase is called pre-training, while the user responsiveness phase is known as inference. The magic behind generative AI and the reason it has exploded is that the way pre-training works has proven to be enormously scalable. That scalability has been made possible by recent innovations in affordable hardware technology and cloud computing.\n\nHow pre-training AI works\n\nGenerally speaking (because getting into specifics would take volumes), AIs pre-train using two principal approaches: supervised and non-supervised. Most AI projects until the current crop of generative AI systems like ChatGPT used the supervised approach.\n\nAlso: How to make ChatGPT provide sources and citations\n\nSupervised pre-training is a process where a model is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input is associated with a corresponding output.\n\nFor example, an AI could be trained on a dataset of customer service conversations, where the user's questions and complaints are labeled with the appropriate responses from the customer service representative. To train the AI, questions like, \"How can I reset my password?\" would be provided as user input, and answers like, \"You can reset your password by visiting the account settings page on our website and following the prompts,\" would be provided as output.\n\nIn a supervised training approach, the overall model is trained to learn a mapping function that can map inputs to outputs accurately. This process is often used in supervised learning tasks, such as classification, regression, and sequence labeling.\n\nAs you might imagine, there are limits to how this can scale. Human trainers would have to go pretty far in anticipating all the inputs and outputs. Training could take a very long time and be limited in subject matter expertise.\n\nAlso: My two favorite ChatGPT Plus features and the remarkable things I can do with them\n\nBut as we've come to realize, ChatGPT has very few limits in subject matter expertise. You can ask it to write a resume for the character Chief Miles O'Brien from Star Trek, have it explain quantum physics, write a piece of code, produce a short piece of fiction, and compare the governing styles of former presidents of the United States.\n\nIt would be impossible to anticipate all the questions that would ever be asked, so there is no way that ChatGPT could have been trained with a supervised model. Instead, ChatGPT uses non-supervised pre-training -- and this is the game-changer.\n\nNon-supervised pre-training is the process by which a model is trained on data where no specific output is associated with each input. Instead, the model is trained to learn the underlying structure and patterns in the input data without any task in mind. This process is often used in unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction. In language modeling, non-supervised pre-training can train a model to understand the syntax and semantics of natural language so the model can generate coherent and meaningful text in a conversational context.\n\nAlso: Is ChatGPT Plus really worth $20 when the free version offers so many premium features?\n\nIt's here where ChatGPT's apparently limitless knowledge becomes possible. Because the developers don't need to know the outputs that come from the inputs, all they have to do is dump more and more information into the ChatGPT pre-training mechanism, which is called transformer-based language modeling.\n\nAlso: How AI companies are secretly collecting training data from the web (and why it matters)\n\nIt's also here, in the dumping of data into the AI, that modern chatbot makers have started to find themselves in trouble. AI companies have been training their AIs on copyrighted information from other companies without permission. In fact, some publishers, like Ziff Davis (ZDNET's parent company) and the New York Times, are suing OpenAI for copyright infringement. You've probably seen the disclaimer on ZDNET that says, \"Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\"\n\nThis universal training approach does make the chatbots more capable. But the side effect is they are taking traffic away from the companies and writers who wrote the original content. Expect this aspect of generative AI to be fought in the courts for years to come.\n\nBut this article is about technology, so let's move on to a key technology that makes generative AI possible...\n\nTransformer architecture\n\nTransformer architecture is a type of neural network that is used for processing natural language data. A neural network simulates how a human brain works by processing information through layers of interconnected nodes. You can think of a neural network like a hockey team. Each player has a role, but they pass the puck back and forth among players with specific positions, all working together to score the goal.\n\nThe transformer architecture processes sequences of words by using \"self-attention\" to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when making predictions. Self-attention is similar to how a reader might look back at a previous sentence or paragraph for the context needed to understand a new word in a book. The transformer looks at all the words in a sequence to understand the context and the relationships between them.\n\nAlso: How I used ChatGPT to quickly fix a critical plugin - without touching a line of code\n\nThe transformer is made up of several layers, each with multiple sub-layers. The two main sub-layers are the self-attention layer and the feedforward layer. The self-attention layer computes the importance of each word in the sequence, while the feedforward layer applies non-linear transformations to the input data. These layers help the transformer learn and understand the relationships between the words in a sequence.\n\nDuring training, the transformer is given input data, such as a sentence, and is asked to make a prediction based on that input. The model is updated based on how well its prediction matches the actual output. Through this process, the transformer learns to understand the context and relationships between words in a sequence, making it a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks such as language translation and text generation.\n\nOne thing to remember is that there are issues around the potential for these models to generate harmful or biased content, as they may learn patterns and biases present in the training data. The companies implementing these models are trying to provide \"guard rails,\" but those guard rails may themselves cause issues. Those concerns are because different people have different perspectives. An attempt to prevent bias based on one school of thought may be claimed as bias by another school of thought. This situation makes the design of a universal chatbot difficult because society is complex.\n\nAlso: 7 advanced ChatGPT prompt-writing tips you need to know\n\nLet's discuss the data that gets fed into ChatGPT first, and then the user-interaction phase of ChatGPT and natural language.\n\nChatGPT's training datasets\n\nThe dataset used to train ChatGPT is huge. ChatGPT is based on something called a large language model, or LLM. Let's take a moment to clarify chatbot vs. LLM. A chatbot is essentially an app with a user interface. It takes in questions or prompts, feeds those to an LLM, and then retrieves the answers, formats them, and presents them to a user. Essentially, a chatbot is a UI shell. It's the LLM that provides the AI capability itself.\n\nLLMs come in a wide variety of names and versions. Right now, the main ChatGPT LLM is GPT-4o. When ChatGPT burst onto the scene back in early 2023, the LLM was GPT-3. There are some LLMs, like OpenAI's o3, that spend more time reasoning, while others are better at interacting with human communication styles. Over time, the LLMs get better, and as a result, the chatbots themselves get more capable as well.\n\nGPT is an acronym that covers three areas: it's generative (G), meaning it generates results; it's pre-trained (P), meaning it's based on all the data it ingests; and it uses the transformer architecture (T), which weighs text inputs to understand context.\n\nGPT-3 was trained on a dataset called WebText2, a library of over 45 terabytes of text data. When you can buy a 16-terabyte hard drive for under $300, a 45-terabyte corpus may not seem that large. But text takes up a lot less storage space than pictures or video.\n\nAlso: How to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus (and 7 reasons why you should)\n\nThis massive amount of data allowed ChatGPT to learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases in natural language at an unprecedented scale, which is one of the reasons why it is so effective at generating coherent and contextually relevant responses to user queries.\n\nWhile ChatGPT is based on the GPT architecture, it has been fine-tuned on multiple datasets and optimized for conversational use cases. This process allows it to provide a more personalized and engaging experience for users who interact with the technology via a chat interface.\n\nFor example, OpenAI (developers of ChatGPT) has released a dataset called Persona-Chat that is specifically designed for training conversational AI models like ChatGPT. This dataset consists of over 160,000 dialogues between two human participants, with each participant assigned a unique persona that describes their background, interests, and personality. This process allows ChatGPT to learn how to generate responses that are personalized to the specific context of the conversation.\n\nIn addition to these datasets, ChatGPT was trained on lots of unstructured data found on the internet, including websites, books, and other text sources. This allowed ChatGPT to learn about the structure and patterns of language in a more general sense, which could then be fine-tuned for specific applications like dialogue management or sentiment analysis.\n\nChatGPT is a distinct model trained using a similar approach to the GPT series but with some differences in architecture and training data.\n\nAlso: The best AI image generators of 2025: Gemini, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and more\n\nOverall, the training data used to fine-tune ChatGPT is typically conversational and specifically curated to include dialogues between humans, allowing ChatGPT to learn how to generate natural and engaging responses in a conversational format.\n\nHere's how to think of ChatGPT's unsupervised training: it was fed a lot of data and left to its own devices to find patterns and make sense of it all. This mechanism allowed the new generative AI systems to scale up so quickly.\n\nWhile the pre-training process does the heavy lifting for ChatGPT's generative AI, the technology also has to understand questions and construct answers from data. That part is done by the inference phase, which consists of natural language processing and dialogue management.\n\nWhat about human involvement in pre-training?\n\nDespite the inherent scalability of non-supervised pre-training, there is some evidence that human assistance may have been involved in the preparation of ChatGPT for public use.\n\nThe big reveal was in an article in TIME Magazine that discussed human \"data labelers\" earning between $1.32 and $2/hour in Kenya. According to the TIME report, it was the responsibility of these workers to scan horrifying and sexually explicit internet content to flag it for ChatGPT training.\n\nAlso: Your next job? Managing a fleet of AI agents\n\nAnother article, posted in Martechpost, an AI newsletter, states that the large language model was trained using a process called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): \"The training process involved a fine-tuned initial model using supervised learning, with human trainers playing both the role of the user and an AI assistant.\"\n\nThere are some subtleties around what the word \"training\" means. According to ChatGPT itself, \"OpenAI did not use reinforcement learning with human feedback to train me. Instead, I was pre-trained using a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, such as language modeling, auto-encoding, and sequence prediction. My training involved processing massive amounts of text data from the internet, which allowed me to learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases.\"\n\nThe AI continued, \"However, once I was pre-trained, researchers and developers can use reinforcement learning with human feedback to fine-tune me for specific tasks or domains, such as answering questions or generating text. In these cases, humans can provide feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, which can be used to update my parameters and improve my performance on similar tasks in the future.\"\n\nAlso: How I used ChatGPT and AI art tools to launch my Etsy business fast\n\nThis answer seems to fit with the Marktechpost and TIME reports, in that the initial pre-training was non-supervised, allowing a tremendous amount of data to be fed into the system. But in building the dialogue responses that communicate with users (more on that below), the response engines were apparently trained both on the types of responses and to filter out inappropriate material—and that training seems to have been human-assisted.\n\nNatural language processing\n\nNatural language processing (NLP) focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. With the exponential growth of digital data and the increasing use of natural language interfaces, NLP has become a crucial technology for many businesses.\n\nNLP technologies can be used for many applications, including sentiment analysis, chatbots, speech recognition, and translation. By leveraging NLP, businesses can automate tasks, improve customer service, and gain valuable insights from customer feedback and social media posts.\n\nAlso: How to write better ChatGPT prompts\n\nOne of the key challenges in implementing NLP is dealing with the complexity and ambiguity of human language. NLP algorithms need to be trained on large amounts of data to recognize patterns and learn the nuances of language. They also need to be continually refined and updated to keep up with changes in language use and context.\n\nThe technology works by breaking down language inputs, such as sentences or paragraphs, into smaller components and analyzing their meanings and relationships to generate insights or responses. NLP technologies use multiple techniques, including statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning, to recognize patterns and learn from large amounts of data to accurately interpret and generate language.\n\nDialogue management\n\nYou may have noticed that ChatGPT can ask follow-up questions to clarify your intent or better understand your needs, and provide personalized responses that consider the entire conversation history.\n\nThis approach is how ChatGPT can have multi-turn conversations with users that feel natural and engaging. The process involves using algorithms and machine learning techniques to understand the context of a conversation and maintain it over multiple exchanges with the user.\n\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to write code - and my top trick for debugging what it generates\n\nDialogue management is an important aspect of natural language processing because it allows computer programs to interact with people in a way that feels more like a conversation than a series of one-off interactions. This approach can help build trust and engagement with users and lead to better outcomes for both the user and the organization using the program.\n\nMarketers, of course, want to expand how trust is built up, but this is also an area that could prove scary because it's one way an AI might be able to manipulate the people who use it.\n\nA look inside the hardware that runs ChatGPT\n\nMicrosoft released a video that discusses how Azure is used to create a network to run all the computation and storage required by ChatGPT. It's a fascinating watch for its discussion of Azure and how AI is architected in real hardware.\n\nFAQ How does ChatGPT's generative AI differ from traditional chatbots? Traditional chatbots operate on predefined rules and decision trees, responding to specific user inputs with predetermined answers. ChatGPT, on the other hand, utilizes generative AI, allowing it to produce unique responses by understanding context and intent, making interactions more dynamic and human-like. Show more Why is non-supervised pre-training considered a game-changer for AI models like ChatGPT? Non-supervised pre-training allows AI models to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data. This approach helps the model grasp the nuances of language without being restricted to specific tasks, enabling it to generate more diverse and contextually relevant responses. Show more Are there any limitations to ChatGPT's ability to understand and respond to user queries? Yes. ChatGPT relies on the data it was trained on, which means it might not always have information on recent topics or niche subjects. Additionally, its responses are generated based on patterns in the data, so it might occasionally produce factually incorrect answers or lack context. Plus, the data it's trained on may be wrong or even weaponized to be outright misleading. Show more\n\nAnd now you know\n\nEven though we're over 3,200 words, this is still a rudimentary overview of all that happens inside ChatGPT. That said, perhaps now you understand more about why this technology has exploded over the past few years. The key to success is that the data itself isn't \"supervised\" and the AI can take what it's been fed and make sense of it.\n\nAlso: 6 new ways ChatGPT Projects supercharges your AI chats - how to try it\n\nWhat do you think?

The generative AI tool can answer questions and assist you with composing text, code, and much more.\n\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT\n\nIt's currently open to use for free. OpenAI launched a paid subscription version called ChatGPT Plus in February 2023, which guarantees users access to the company's latest models, exclusive features, and updates but is not necessary for basic usage.\n\nWhat is ChatGPT used for?\n\nChatGPT offers many functions in addition to answering simple questions. ChatGPT can compose essays, have philosophical conversations, do math, and even code for you.\n\nThe tasks ChatGPT can help with don't have to be so ambitious. For example, my favorite use case for ChatGPT is to help create basic lists for chores, such as packing and grocery shopping, and to-do lists that make my daily life more productive. The possibilities are endless.\n\nZDNET has published many ChatGPT how-to guides. Below are some of the most popular ones.\n\nUse ChatGPT to:\n\nIs ChatGPT available for free?\n\nChatGPT is free, regardless of what you use it for, including writing, coding, and much more.\n\nThere is a subscription option, ChatGPT Plus, that costs $20 per month. The paid subscription model gives you extra perks, such as priority access to GPT-4o, DALL-E 3, unlimited photogeneration, Canvas, Voice Mode, and the latest upgrades.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT vs ChatGPT Plus: Is it worth the subscription fee?\n\nAlthough the subscription price may seem steep, it is the same amount as Microsoft Copilot Pro and Google One AI Premium, which are Microsoft's and Google's paid AI offerings.\n\nHow can you access ChatGPT?\n\nOn April 1, 2024, OpenAI stopped requiring you to log in to ChatGPT. Now, you can access ChatGPT simply by visiting chat.openai.com. You can also access ChatGPT via an iPhone, Android, or desktop app.\n\nOnce you visit the site, you can start chatting away with ChatGPT. A great way to get started is by asking a question, similar to what you would do with Google. You can ask as many questions as you'd like.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT no longer requires a login, but you might want one anyway. Here's why\n\nCreating an OpenAI account still offers some perks, such as saving and reviewing your chat history, accessing custom instructions, and, most importantly, getting free access to GPT-4o. Signing up is free and easy; you can use your existing Google login.\n\nFor step-by-step instructions, check out ZDNET's guide on how to start using ChatGPT.\n\nIs there a ChatGPT app?\n\nYes, an official ChatGPT app is available for iPhone and Android users. Make sure to download OpenAI's app, as many copycat fake apps are listed on Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store that are not affiliated with OpenAI.\n\nAlso: I changed 5 ChatGPT settings and instantly became more productive - here's how\n\nThere's also a ChatGPT app for MacOS and Windows, which lets you access the chatbot quickly via a keyboard shortcut. The Mac app was initially only available for ChatGPT Plus subscribers, but OpenAI recently made it available to all users. The Windows app is still limited to ChatGPT Plus, Enterprise, and EDU users.\n\nIs ChatGPT safe?\n\nPeople have expressed concerns about AI chatbots replacing or atrophying human intelligence.\n\nFor example, chatbots can write an entire essay in seconds, raising concerns about students cheating and not learning how to write properly. These fears even led some school districts to block access when ChatGPT initially launched.\n\nNow, not only have many of those schools decided to unblock the technology, but some higher education institutions have been catering their academic offerings to AI-related coursework.\n\nAlso: Two ways you can build custom AI assistants with GPT-4o - and one is free\n\nAnother concern with AI chatbots is the possible spread of misinformation. ChatGPT says: \"My responses are not intended to be taken as fact, and I always encourage people to verify any information they receive from me or any other source.\" OpenAI also notes that ChatGPT sometimes writes \"plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.\"\n\nLastly, there are ethical and privacy concerns regarding the information ChatGPT was trained on. OpenAI scraped the internet to train the chatbot without asking content owners for permission to use their content, which brings up many copyright and intellectual property concerns.\n\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to analyze PDFs for free\n\nThere are also privacy concerns regarding generative AI companies using your data to fine-tune their models further, which has become a common practice. OpenAI lets you turn off training in ChatGPT's settings.\n\nSo, is ChatGPT safe? If your main concern is privacy, OpenAI has implemented several options to give users peace of mind that their data will not be used to train models. The company even allows you to turn off your chat history. If you are concerned about moral and ethical problems, they are still being hotly debated.\n\nWill my conversations with ChatGPT be used for training?\n\nCompanies train generative AI models on user inputs. Therefore, when familiarizing yourself with how to use ChatGPT, you might wonder if your specific conversations will be used for training and, if so, who can view your chats.\n\nAlso: This ChatGPT update fixed one of my biggest productivity issues with the AI chatbot\n\nOpenAI will, by default, use your conversations with the free chatbot to train data and refine its models. You can opt out of it using your data for model training by clicking on the question mark in the bottom left-hand corner, Settings, and turning off \"Improve the model for everyone.\"\n\nCan ChatGPT help me apply for jobs?\n\nYes, ChatGPT is a great resource for helping with job applications. Undertaking a job search can be tedious and difficult, and ChatGPT can help you lighten the load. ChatGPT can build your resume and write a cover letter.\n\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT to write an essay\n\nIf your application has any written supplements, you can use ChatGPT to help you write those essays or personal statements. You can also use ChatGPT to prep for your interviews by asking ChatGPT to provide you mock interview questions, background on the company, or questions that you can ask.\n\nCan you use ChatGPT for schoolwork?\n\nChatGPT can be an excellent resource in assisting students with their work. A popular misconception is that ChatGPT and other AI resources will do students' work for them. However, it can be used as a personal tutor or editor, giving students assistance outside of the classroom.\n\nAlso: 5 free AI tools for school that students, teachers, and parents can use, too\n\nFor example, a student can drop their essay into ChatGPT and have it copyedit, upload class handwritten notes and have them digitized, or even generate study outlines from class materials.\n\nIt is especially helpful for coding homework since most coding languages are very character-sensitive, and one missing semicolon can throw the entire result off. Instead of staring at the screen for ages, you can ask ChatGPT to identify errors for you, which allows you to grow.\n\nWhat does ChatGPT stand for?\n\nThe last three letters in ChatGPT's namesake stand for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a family of large language models created by OpenAI that uses deep learning to generate human-like, conversational text.\n\nAlso: What does GPT stand for? Understanding GPT 3.5, GPT 4, GPT-4 Turbo, and more\n\nThe \"Chat\" part of the name is simply a callout to its chatting capabilities.\n\nCan ChatGPT generate images?\n\nYes, ChatGPT can generate images using DALL-E 3. However, the limits vary depending on whether you are a ChatGPT Plus subscriber or a free user. ChatGPT Plus subscribers are allowed 50 generations per day, while free users are allotted two.\n\nAlso: The best AI image generators of 2024: Tested and reviewed\n\nSince OpenAI discontinued DALL-E 2 in February 2024, the only way to access its most advanced AI image generator, DALL-E 3, through OpenAI's offerings is via its chatbot.\n\nMicrosoft's Copilot offers free image generation, also powered by DALL-E 3, in its chatbot. This is a great alternative if you don't want to pay for ChatGPT Plus but want high-quality image outputs for free.\n\nHow does ChatGPT work?\n\nChatGPT runs on a large language model (LLM) architecture created by OpenAI called the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Since its launch, the free version of ChatGPT ran on a fine-tuned model in the GPT-3.5 series until May 2024, when OpenAI upgraded the model to GPT-4o. Now, the free version runs on GPT-4o mini, with limited access to GPT-4o.\n\nAlso: How does ChatGPT actually work?\n\nWith a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, you can access GPT-4, GPT-4o mini or GPT-4o. Plus, users also have priority access to GPT-4o, even at capacity, while free users get booted down to GPT-4o mini.\n\nThe LLMs used in generative AI models of this type are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, including websites, books, news articles, and more, typically via web scraping, where the entirety of the internet is scraped for information.\n\nWho owns ChatGPT currently?\n\nOpenAI launched ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. OpenAI has also developed DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3, popular AI image generators, and Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot and worthy alternatives\n\nAs a result, OpenAI owns ChatGPT. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI thanks to multiyear, multi-billion dollar investments. Elon Musk was an investor when OpenAI was first founded in 2015 but has since completely severed ties with the startup and created his own AI chatbot,Grok.\n\nIs ChatGPT better than a search engine?\n\nChatGPT is an AI chatbot created to converse with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help users find information. One is not better than the other, as each suits different purposes.\n\nWhen searching for as much up-to-date, accurate information as possible, your most reliable option is a search engine. It will provide you with pages upon pages of sources you can peruse.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT has officially replaced Google Search for me - here's why\n\nIn November 2024, OpenAI already unveiled ChatGPT Search, a feature within the ChatGPT app that lets users search the web for timely, up-to-date information, complete with citations linked to sources.\n\nWith ChatGPT Search, you can enter your sentence as your train of thought takes you, and the AI will understand the meaning of your query by leveraging its NLP capabilities. This means you can spend less time crafting a tailored search query but still get exactly what you want.\n\nIf you are looking for a platform that can explain complex topics in an easy-to-understand manner, then ChatGPT might be what you want. If you want the best of both worlds, plenty of AI search engines combine both.\n\nThe search experience is available on the ChatGPT website, desktops, and mobile apps for all ChatGPT Plus, Team users, and SearchGPT waitlist users.\n\nWhat is SearchGPT?\n\nSearchGPT is an experimental offering from OpenAI that functions as an AI-powered search engine that is aware of current events and uses real-time information from the Internet. The experience was a prototype. OpenAI integrated the best features directly into ChatGPT with ChatGPT Search.\n\nUpon launching the prototype, users were given a waitlist to sign up for. However, shortly after, OpenAI closed its waitlist. Those users were given priority access to ChatGPT Search when it launched.\n\nWhat is ChatGPT Search?\n\nIn November, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT Search, a feature that lets users search the web directly within ChatGPT for timely, up-to-date information, complete with citations linked to sources. The tool can be called on manually or activated whenever a user prompt could benefit from web-based information.\n\nWhat are ChatGPT's limitations?\n\nDespite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT still has limitations. Users sometimes need to reword questions multiple times for ChatGPT to understand their intent. A bigger limitation is a lack of quality in responses, which can sometimes be plausible-sounding but are verbose or make no practical sense.\n\nAlso: Police are using AI to write crime reports. What could go wrong?\n\nInstead of asking for clarification on ambiguous questions, the model guesses what your question means, which can lead to poor responses. Generative AI models are also subject to hallucinations, which can result in inaccurate responses.\n\nDoes ChatGPT give wrong answers?\n\nAs mentioned above, ChatGPT, like all language models, has limitations and can give nonsensical answers and incorrect information, so it's important to double-check the answers it gives you.\n\nAlso: 8 ways to reduce ChatGPT hallucinations\n\nOpenAI recommends you provide feedback on what ChatGPT generates by using the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to improve its underlying model. You can also join the startup's Bug Bounty program, which offers up to $20,000 for reporting security bugs and safety issues.\n\nCan ChatGPT refuse to answer my prompts?\n\nAI systems like ChatGPT can and do reject inappropriate requests. The AI assistant can identify inappropriate submissions to prevent unsafe content generation.\n\nAlso: 6 things ChatGPT can't do (and another 20 it refuses to do)\n\nThese submissions include questions that violate someone's rights, are offensive, are discriminatory, or involve illegal activities. The ChatGPT model can also challenge incorrect premises, answer follow-up questions, and even admit mistakes when you point them out.\n\nThese guardrails are important. AI models can generate advanced, realistic content that can be exploited by bad actors for harm, such as spreading misinformation about public figures and influencing elections.\n\nDoes ChatGPT plagiarize?\n\nYes, OpenAI scraped the internet to train ChatGPT's models. Therefore, the technology's knowledge is influenced by other people's work. Since there is no guarantee that ChatGPT's outputs are entirely original, the chatbot may regurgitate someone else's work in your answer, which is considered plagiarism.\n\nAlso, technically speaking, if you, as a user, copy and paste ChatGPT's response, that is an act of plagiarism because you are claiming someone else's work as your own. This act could have repercussions based on the rules enforced by your workplace or educational institution.\n\nIs there a ChatGPT detector?\n\nIn short, the answer is no, not because people haven't tried, but because none do it efficiently.\n\nIn January 2023, OpenAI released a free tool to detect AI-generated text. Unfortunately, OpenAI's classifier tool could only correctly identify 26% of AI-written text with a \"likely AI-written\" designation. Furthermore, it provided false positives 9% of the time, incorrectly identifying human-written work as AI-produced.\n\nAlso: I tested 7 AI content detectors - they're getting dramatically better at identifying plagiarism\n\nThe tool performed so poorly that, six months after its release, OpenAI shut it down \"due to its low rate of accuracy.\" Despite the tool's failure, the startup claims to be researching more effective techniques for AI text identification.\n\nOther AI detectors exist on the market, including GPT-2 Output Detector, Writer AI Content Detector, and Content at Scale's AI Content Detection tool. ZDNET tested these tools, and the results were underwhelming: all three were unreliable sources for spotting AI, repeatedly giving false negatives. Here are ZDNET's full test results.\n\nWhat is GPT-4?\n\nGPT-4 is OpenAI's language model, much more advanced than its predecessor, GPT-3.5. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 in a series of simulated benchmark exams and produces fewer hallucinations.\n\nWhat is GPT-4o?\n\nGPT-4o is OpenAI's latest, fastest, and most advanced flagship model. As the name implies, GPT-4o has the same intelligence as GPT-4. However, the \"o\" in the title stands for \"omni,\" referring to its multimodal capabilities, which allow the model to understand text, audio, image, and video inputs and output text, audio, and image outputs.\n\nAlso: 6 ways OpenAI just supercharged ChatGPT for free users\n\nThe model is 50% cheaper in OpenAI's API than GPT-4 Turbo while still matching its English and coding capabilities and outperforming it in non-English language, vision, and audio understanding -- a big win for developers.\n\nWhat is ChatGPT o1?\n\nIn September 2024, OpenAI unveiled its o1 models, which are capable of more advanced reading, making them ideal for math, science, and coding. For example, it scored 83% on the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exam. For comparison, GPT-4o correctly solved only 13% of problems.\n\nAlso: What are o1 and o1-mini? OpenAI's mystery AI models are finally here\n\nZDNET's David Gewirtz put o1- preview to the test and was impressed by its ability to tackle several complex tasks with lots of detail, including writing a WordPress plugin, rewriting a string function, finding an annoying bug, and more.\n\nWhat are the best ChatGPT alternatives?\n\nAlthough ChatGPT gets the most buzz, other options are just as good -- and might even be better suited to your needs. ZDNET has created a list of the best chatbots, all of which we have tested to identify the best tool for your requirements.\n\nAlso: Claude AI can now analyze PDFs - here's how to try it\n\nDespite ChatGPT's extensive abilities, other chatbots have advantages that might be better suited for your use case, including Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, Jasper, and more.\n\nWhat are GPTs?\n\nOpenAI once offered plugins for ChatGPT to connect to third-party applications and access real-time information on the web. The plugins expanded ChatGPT's abilities, allowing it to assist with many more activities, such as planning a trip or finding a place to eat.\n\nAlso: My two favorite ChatGPT Plus features and the remarkable things I can do with them\n\nHowever, on March 19, 2024, OpenAI stopped letting users install new plugins or start new conversations with existing ones. Instead, OpenAI replaced plugins with GPTs, which are easier for developers to build.\n\nWith the latest update, all users, including those on the free plan, can access the GPT Store and find 3 million customized ChatGPT chatbots. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of spam in the GPT store, so be careful which ones you use.\n\nWhat is Microsoft's involvement with ChatGPT?\n\nMicrosoft was an early investor in OpenAI, the AI startup behind ChatGPT, long before ChatGPT was released to the public. Microsoft's first involvement with OpenAI was in 2019 when the company invested $1 billion. The company invested another $2 billion in the years after. In January 2023, Microsoft extended its partnership with OpenAI through a multiyear, multi-billion dollar investment.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT vs. Copilot: Which AI chatbot is better for you?\n\nNeither company disclosed the investment value, but unnamed sources told Bloomberg that it could total $10 billion over multiple years. In return, OpenAI's exclusive cloud-computing provider -- Microsoft Azure, powers all OpenAI workloads across research, products, and API services.\n\nMicrosoft has also used its OpenAI partnership to revamp its Bing search engine and improve its browser. On February 7, 2023, Microsoft unveiled a new Bing tool, now known as Copilot, that runs on OpenAI's GPT-4, customized specifically for search.\n\nHow does Copilot compare to ChatGPT?\n\nCopilot uses OpenAI's GPT-4, which means that since its launch, it has been more efficient and capable than the standard, free version of ChatGPT, which was powered by GPT 3.5 at the time. At the time, Copilot boasted several other features over ChatGPT, such as access to the internet, knowledge of current information, and footnotes.\n\nAlso: I was a Copilot diehard until ChatGPT added these 5 features\n\nIn May 2024, however, OpenAI supercharged the free version of its chatbot with GPT-4o. The upgrade gave users GPT-4 level intelligence, the ability to get responses from the web, analyze data, chat about photos and documents, use GPTs, and access the GPT Store and Voice Mode. After the upgrade, ChatGPT reclaimed its crown as the best AI chatbot.\n\nWhat is Gemini and how does it relate to ChatGPT?\n\nGemini is Google's AI chat service, a rival to ChatGPT. On February 6, 2023, Google introduced its experimental AI chat service, which was then called Google Bard.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Gemini: Which is the best AI chatbot?\n\nOver a month after the announcement, Google began rolling out access to Bard first via a waitlist. Now, the tool is available to the public. The biggest perk of Gemini is that it has Google Search at its core and has the same feel as Google products. Therefore, if you are an avid Google user, Gemini might be the best AI chatbot for you.\n\nWhat is Apple's involvement with OpenAI?\n\nAt Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference in June 2024, the company announced a partnership with OpenAI that will integrate ChatGPT with Siri. With the user's permission, Siri can request ChatGPT for help if Siri deems a task is better suited for ChatGPT. This feature has not yet been released to users.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"openai\", \"access\", \"plus\", \"models\", \"popular\", \"chatgpt\", \"model\", \"free\", \"benefit\", \"users\", \"worlds\", \"chatbot\", \"search\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "df33966748505c6edae7ca6ff578f18a108c93fd7ddccb24e52e6bfbd951a365", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:56:52.135004+00:00"}

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Michael Gariffo/ZDNET\n\nThe past five years or so have seen the television market diversify to the point where it's hard to keep up. Simple LCD and plasma TVs have been replaced by a veritable alphabet soup of acronyms like QLED, Neo QLED, OLED, Mini LED, Micro LED, and probably a few other variations I'm forgetting. It's a lot for a tech writer to keep track of, let alone the average consumer.\n\nAlso: The best TVs money can buy\n\nIn this article, I'll clarify the differences between two of the most popular technologies: Neo QLED and OLED. I'll demystify each technology, the pros and cons of both, and define which might best serve you best in your next TV.\n\nWhat is Neo QLED?\n\nA trio of Samsung's Neo QLED TVs in 4K and 8K resolutions. Samsung\n\nLet's start with the basics. Neo QLED (Neo Quantum Light Emitting Diode) is a name exclusive to Samsung's 4K and 8K televisions. The panels employ what Samsung calls Quantum Matrix technology, which provides backlighting via thousands of tiny LEDs. Each LED is a small fraction of the size of those in older TV backlighting setups. This means that Neo QLED's closest non-proprietary analog is Mini LED (explained below in the FAQ section).\n\nAlso: The best QLED TVs you can buy (from 50 to 98 inches)\n\nA Neo QLED panel has thousands of lighting zones. In older TVs, sections of the screen that should be pitch black appear gray or milky due to the limited number of lighting zones. Some older TVs have as few as four for the whole screen. With Neo QLED, precise portions of the screen are lit.\n\nThe result is an image with better, sharper contrast between lights and darks, and more accurate colors. Samsung's use of its Quantum Dot technology, which provides additional light filtration on a pixel-by-pixel basis to make the colors more accurate and richly saturated, additionally improves color accuracy.\n\nWhat is OLED?\n\nA 97-inch LG OLED TV at CES 2023 June Wan/ZDNET\n\nOLED is an older, non-proprietary technology that is differentiated by a single layer that provides light and color. Where Neo QLED and most other panel types rely on one layer to provide the colors for the individual pixels and another layer to light up those colored pixels, OLED panel pixels provide their own light.\n\nAn OLED TV is essentially an array of millions of microscopic, color-changing LEDs. Each pixel emits colored light, meaning there are as many lighting zones as there are pixels. Each one can also switch off entirely, providing perfect black levels.\n\nAlso: Must-have OLED TVs: The crown jewel of home theaters\n\nOLED televisions have been around for years, with almost every major TV manufacturer producing a version.\n\nWhich is better, Neo QLED or OLED?\n\nThis model of Sony OLED is thinner than the Pixel 6 Pro used in the pic. Rebecca Isaacs/ZDNET\n\nAs with most technology comparisons, there's no universal answer here. The right answer depends on what content you watch, your budget, your viewing environment, and your personal preferences.\n\nSome models of Samsung's Neo QLED television feature the option to display multiple sources and apps at once. Samsung\n\nNeo QLED pros and cons\n\nPros:\n\nBrightness - Due to its use of discrete, miniaturized LEDs for backlighting, Samsung's Neo QLED tech creates images four to five times brighter than OLED panels, on average. This makes Neo QLED panels great for brightly lit rooms.\n\n\n\n- Due to its use of discrete, miniaturized LEDs for backlighting, Samsung's Neo QLED tech creates images four to five times brighter than OLED panels, on average. This makes Neo QLED panels great for brightly lit rooms. Refresh rate - While OLED TVs and monitors are finally catching up to their competition's refresh rates, there is a wider selection of Neo QLED displays with higher refresh rates. This refresh rate is important for gaming and watching fast-paced live sports.\n\n- While OLED TVs and monitors are finally catching up to their competition's refresh rates, there is a wider selection of Neo QLED displays with higher refresh rates. This refresh rate is important for gaming and watching fast-paced live sports. Cost - There are certainly more budget-friendly OLED options than ever. However, many models sacrifice port selection, smart TV features, and other useful display tech to reach a budget price while still including OLED panels. Neo QLED, on a feature-by-feature comparison, typically comes at a price of at least a few hundred dollars below an equivalent OLED model.\n\nCons:\n\nImperfect black levels - While Neo QLED is one of OLED's closest competitors for ideal black levels, it still can't match the contrast of OLEDs. This deficiency is because Neo QLED lights millions of pixels with only thousands of LEDs. The result is minimal, but still visible, light bleed.\n\n- While Neo QLED is one of OLED's closest competitors for ideal black levels, it still can't match the contrast of OLEDs. This deficiency is because Neo QLED lights millions of pixels with only thousands of LEDs. The result is minimal, but still visible, light bleed. Selection - Unlike OLED TVs, Neo QLED displays are exclusive to Samsung. This exclusivity means that if you're not a fan of Samsung's Smart TV interface, design philosophy, or the company as a whole, you're out of luck. OLED panels are, conversely, made by a slew of manufacturers you can choose from.\n\n- Unlike OLED TVs, Neo QLED displays are exclusive to Samsung. This exclusivity means that if you're not a fan of Samsung's Smart TV interface, design philosophy, or the company as a whole, you're out of luck. OLED panels are, conversely, made by a slew of manufacturers you can choose from. Thickness - It might seem comical to call a Neo QLED TV thick (most are around one inch in depth), but they're still much thicker than OLED panels. There's a reason OLED technology remains so popular in smartphones. The tech provides one of the slimmest display panels you can buy. OLED TVs practically disappear when viewed edge-on.\n\nOLED TVs won't give you a million-dollar infinity pool to look at behind them, but this Sony model would still look futuristic in any living room. Sony\n\nOLED pros and cons\n\n\n\nPros:\n\nContrast and black levels - OLED's contrast and black levels are unmatched. If you consume a lot of content with dark scenes (like horror movies or video games), you'll have a better experience with an OLED.\n\n- OLED's contrast and black levels are unmatched.

Thinness - Although most OLED TVs will have a section toward the bottom end about two inches thick, most of the display is thinner than your smartphone, often dropping to 1/4-inch thick in some models. This thinness provides visual appeal and premium quality, especially when mounted on a wall.\n\n- Although most OLED TVs will have a section toward the bottom end about two inches thick, most of the display is thinner than your smartphone, often dropping to 1/4-inch thick in some models. This thinness provides visual appeal and premium quality, especially when mounted on a wall. Model diversity - OLED TVs were once almost wholly the domain of LG. That situation has changed dramatically. Nearly every major manufacturer, Samsung included, has joined the party. OLED models are now available in a wider variety of sizes, resolutions, and price points than ever before.\n\nCons:\n\nPrice - OLED prices have fallen somewhat, but a fully-featured OLED TV will almost always be more expensive than alternative technologies.\n\n- OLED prices have fallen somewhat, but a fully-featured OLED TV will almost always be more expensive than alternative technologies. Fragility - All that thinness means the panels can be delicate. Any television will shatter from a hard blow, but OLEDs even require caution when mounting them thanks to their ultraslim display panels. The TVs can't support their weight, making lifting them into place by their beefier bottom sections particularly tricky.\n\n- All that thinness means the panels can be delicate. Any television will shatter from a hard blow, but OLEDs even require caution when mounting them thanks to their ultraslim display panels. The TVs can't support their weight, making lifting them into place by their beefier bottom sections particularly tricky. Burn-in risk - Burn-in happens when a display retains residual images that won't disappear, no matter how many times its pixels are refreshed. If you've ever had a monitor with a permanent, ghostly version of a Windows taskbar, you've experienced this issue. OLED panels can be more prone to burn-in than competing LED technology. While manufacturers have used numerous methods to combat this issue, and panels are more resilient than they have been before, it's still worth considering, especially if you expect to display static imagery for extended periods.\n\nHopefully reading this piece will prevent you from being as confused as this guy looks. Getty\n\nShould I buy a Neo QLED or OLED TV?\n\n\n\nThere are some categories of consumers to whom I would recommend one type over the other:\n\nGamers or sports fans - Neo QLED: The additional available brightness, more common availability of 120Hz refresh rates, and lack of worry about in-game graphics or sports score overlays causing burn-in all point toward Neo QLED being the better choice.\n\n- Neo QLED: The additional available brightness, more common availability of 120Hz refresh rates, and lack of worry about in-game graphics or sports score overlays causing burn-in all point toward Neo QLED being the better choice.

Viewers with super-bright living rooms - Neo QLED: OLED's rich colors and dark blacks won't matter if the image is too dark to see due to ambient light from windows or lamps. While you can try to reduce room light using window treatments or dimmers, it's not always practical. For this reason, the vastly superior maximum brightness of Neo QLED wins here.\n\n- Neo QLED: OLED's rich colors and dark blacks won't matter if the image is too dark to see due to ambient light from windows or lamps. While you can try to reduce room light using window treatments or dimmers, it's not always practical. For this reason, the vastly superior maximum brightness of Neo QLED wins here. Picky interior decorators and others who prioritize aesthetics - OLED: The ultraslim profile of an OLED TV gives it two advantages. First, it makes the TV almost vanish when viewed from the side. Second, it makes the television much easier to hide in a cabinet.\n\nBoth Neo QLED and OLED TVs are great, and you're not going to be disappointed with either. There are models of either TV type that will blow away anything that came before, and will likely make you forget any doubts you had the second you flip it on for the first time in your living room.\n\nFAQs What is HDMI 2.1? Whichever side of this article you settle on, it's a good idea to future-proof your purchase by selecting a model that supports the latest HDMI technology. HDMI 2.1, the current standard, supports features like resolutions of up to 10K at 120Hz, Dynamic HDR for the best color performance, and reduced latency for gaming. Don't break your budget for an HDMI 2.1 model, but keep it in mind when you're making your purchase so you can hang onto that display for longer. Show more What other TV technologies are there? We'll focus on the most important and practical ones: Mini LED is essentially a non-proprietary version of the same tech used in Neo QLED, but without Samsung's Quantum Dot layer overlaying it.

LED has largely been replaced by technologies that can produce more accurate lighting zones. Here's an explanation of the difference between LED and OLED. Also: Is OLED better than QLED? Show more How large a TV should I buy? This is a common point of contention between shoppers in the same household. Some say \"the biggest one you can afford\" is the answer, but others note that even 4K resolutions look less appealing when stretched beyond 65 inches and viewed up close. Samsung advises using \"Viewing distance (in inches)/2 = recommended TV size\" as your rule of thumb. This means you should get a 60-inch TV if you plan to sit 10 feet (120 inches) from the display, a 30-inch model if you're only 5 feet away, or a massive 80-inch screen if you're over 13 feet away. I'd suggest getting some cardboard or thick paper and mocking up the different potential sizes. Seeing the real-world scale of the rectangle you'll be staring at often clarifies things better than any equation can.

{"url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-samsung-phone/", "title": "The best Samsung phones to buy in 2025", "authors": "[\"Kerry Wan\", \"Managing Editor\", \"Alison Denisco Rayome\"]", "published": null, "text": "Samsung is heading into the fall season with some serious momentum, with several flagship Android phones already under its belt in 2025, including the highly capable Galaxy S25 Ultra and ultra-thin Galaxy S25 Edge. The recently announced Galaxy Z series, consisting of the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, rounds out the brand's summer releases.\n\nWhether you're looking for cutting-edge camera features, all-day battery life, or a foldable screen that doubles as a tablet, there's a Samsung phone designed to meet your needs. When testing Samsung devices, we consider their performance, display quality, endurance, camera capabilities, and unique special features.\n\nWhat is the best Samsung phone right now?\n\nAfter extensively testing the latest phones on the market, I've found that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best Samsung phone right now, with the company's top-of-the-line features and specifications, including an S Pen stylus for precision inputs, a 200MP camera system, and the most durable display on any Galaxy phone yet. The size and abundance of features of the S25 Ultra may almost be overwhelming for some users, but you certainly get what you pay for, with its starting price of $1,299.\n\nOur runner-ups on this list are just as noteworthy. The smaller Galaxy S25 Plus variant is nearly as capable as the Ultra model but costs at least $300 less. You'll lose the S Pen and 200MP camera but retain most of the software AI features and AMOLED display. For something more experiential, consider the Galaxy Z Flip 7, which flips and folds into a pocketable square and is accessibly priced.\n\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\n\nSort by All Value Performance Battery life Camera quality Display\n\nThe best Samsung phones in 2025\n\nShow less View now at Samsung View now at Walmart View now at Best Buy Why we like it: The Galaxy S25 Ultra stands out as the premier handset in Samsung's lineup, largely thanks to its robust Galaxy AI capabilities and far-reaching hardware features. The latest Galaxy AI suite brings practical and useful features like real-time call translation, voice commands that work across multiple apps, and photo editing capabilities. My real-world testing suggests these AI functions surpass those on competing Android devices in speed, consistency, and overall usefulness. Beyond the AI, the phone has impressed us with its large 6.9-inch, anti-reflective, AMOLED display and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. It helps that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, 12GB of RAM, and improved vapor cooling chamber all contribute to a more power-efficient experience. Durability is another key strength you should be aware of, owing to its lightweight titanium frame and resilient Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass. Sure, you'll see some microscratches from everyday use, but cracking the Ultra model is harder than ever. Furthermore, the camera system is significantly upgraded with a 50MP ultrawide lens that captures landscape and macro shots with greater detail and vibrancy. We've run several camera tests between the S25 Ultra and competing phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and found the Samsung model to deliver the sharpest and vibrant imagery. Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Who it's for: The Galaxy S25 Ultra is primarily targeted toward users who demand the best smartphone experience Samsung can provide and are keen to explore the latest consumer-facing AI features. It represents a particularly compelling upgrade for individuals holding onto three to four-year-old devices, offering significant advancements across the board. The durable build makes it an excellent choice for those who prioritize drop protection and longevity. Multimedia enthusiasts will appreciate the large, anti-reflective, 6.9-inch screen combined with enhanced cooling for smooth gaming and movie playback. Additionally, photography lovers looking for improved detail and color in wide-angle and close-up macro shots will find the new 50MP ultrawide camera valuable. Who should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't my top choice for everyone. Its $1,299 price point puts it out of reach for budget-conscious consumers, and users who frequently utilize the S Pen's Bluetooth gestures for actions like remotely triggering the camera may be disappointed, as the functionality has been removed. Furthermore, individuals who prefer a less angular or \"boxy\" phone design might find the standard Galaxy S25 Plus or S25 Edge models more aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold. If you don't require the absolute pinnacle of performance, the largest possible screen, or the most advanced camera system Samsung offers, the more affordable S25 Plus and S25 Edge provide many similar core features and represent better value. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto with 5x zoom, 10MP telephoto with 3x zoom | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: Starting at $1,299 Value 7 Performance 10 Battery life 10 Camera quality 9 Display 9 Pros AI-centric Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset\n\nImproved ultrawide rear camera\n\nOne of the brightest, glare-free displays on the market Cons On the pricier side for a non-foldable phone\n\nNo Qi2 wireless charging\n\nS Pen no longer supports Bluetooth gestures Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Best Samsung phone overall 4.5 / 5 Score Why we like it: The Galaxy S25 Ultra stands out as the premier handset in Samsung's lineup, largely thanks to its robust Galaxy AI capabilities and far-reaching hardware features. The latest Galaxy AI suite brings practical and useful features like real-time call translation, voice commands that work across multiple apps, and photo editing capabilities. My real-world testing suggests these AI functions surpass those on competing Android devices in speed, consistency, and overall usefulness. Beyond the AI, the phone has impressed us with its large 6.9-inch, anti-reflective, AMOLED display and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. It helps that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, 12GB of RAM, and improved vapor cooling chamber all contribute to a more power-efficient experience. Durability is another key strength you should be aware of, owing to its lightweight titanium frame and resilient Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass. Sure, you'll see some microscratches from everyday use, but cracking the Ultra model is harder than ever. Furthermore, the camera system is significantly upgraded with a 50MP ultrawide lens that captures landscape and macro shots with greater detail and vibrancy. We've run several camera tests between the S25 Ultra and competing phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and found the Samsung model to deliver the sharpest and vibrant imagery. Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Who it's for: The Galaxy S25 Ultra is primarily targeted toward users who demand the best smartphone experience Samsung can provide and are keen to explore the latest consumer-facing AI features. It represents a particularly compelling upgrade for individuals holding onto three to four-year-old devices, offering significant advancements across the board. The durable build makes it an excellent choice for those who prioritize drop protection and longevity. Multimedia enthusiasts will appreciate the large, anti-reflective, 6.9-inch screen combined with enhanced cooling for smooth gaming and movie playback. Additionally, photography lovers looking for improved detail and color in wide-angle and close-up macro shots will find the new 50MP ultrawide camera valuable. Who should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't my top choice for everyone. Its $1,299 price point puts it out of reach for budget-conscious consumers, and users who frequently utilize the S Pen's Bluetooth gestures for actions like remotely triggering the camera may be disappointed, as the functionality has been removed. Furthermore, individuals who prefer a less angular or \"boxy\" phone design might find the standard Galaxy S25 Plus or S25 Edge models more aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold.

It packs the same well-tested Snapdragon 8 Elite processor found in the Ultra and features a capable 50MP primary camera, ensuring high performance and quality photos. Users get the same smooth OneUI software experience, which means many, if not all, of the helpful AI tools found on the Ultra model, like enhanced Gemini and Generative Edit photo features, are available on the Plus, too. Samsung also offers a reassuring seven-year commitment to software updates, keeping the phone up to date for longer than many older models and brands. (For reference, Google offers a similar update standard, but Motorola and OnePlus hover between two and four years.) While the 4,900mAh battery capacity is unchanged from last year's S24 Plus, combining the efficient new processor and AI assistance results in slightly better battery life -- about an hour longer of usage, from the endurance tests we've run. Durability is also solid on the Plus, thanks to its Gorilla Glass screen, aluminum frame, and IP68 water resistance rating. Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Who it's for: This phone is ideal for those desiring a large-screen Samsung experience and high-end performance, but don't necessarily need every feature the Ultra offers, such as the S Pen or its anti-reflective screen coating. Priced $300 lower than the Ultra with a $999 starting point, the Plus hits a sweet spot for readers looking for great value. The S25 Plus is also well-suited for users comfortable with a maximum internal storage of 512GB (only the Ultra model supports 1TB) who prioritize having the latest processing power and AI software features, backed by long-term update support. Who should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, potential buyers might want to look elsewhere under certain conditions. Heavy photographers or videographers anticipating needing more than 512GB of internal storage should spring for the S25 Ultra, which offers higher capacity options. Similarly, those who desire the unique features of the Ultra, like the integrated S Pen stylus or the enhanced anti-reflective display, should opt for that model instead. In those cases, the Plus model won't fully meet those needs. For alternatives, last year's Galaxy S24 Plus offers a similar large-screen experience and may now be available at a lower price. If you prefer a smaller device but still want similar internal power and features, the standard Galaxy S25 is also worth considering.

Samsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches. Naturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the \"inferior\" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature. Review: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Who it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr. This ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this. Who should look elsewhere: With a starting price tag of $1,999, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead. Users shopping for a foldable phone should consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits.

I've been testing the phone for a little more than a week, and it still blows my mind how this design combination exists in 2025. Picking up almost any other big-screen phone is like taking a step back in time. While the S25 Edge is the first of its kind, it features the best aspects of the standard Galaxy S25 models, including the tried-and-tested 200MP main camera of the Ultra, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 12GB of RAM, and a display that gets brighter than most phones when outdoors. Based on my review, the lack of a dedicated telephoto lens on the S25 Edge wasn't sorely missed, as the main sensor retained a good amount of detail even after digitally cropping. Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Who it's for: Tech enthusiasts and users with delicate wrists (myself included) will benefit from the ultra-thin design of the S25 Edge. It really is one of those phones you have to see and hold to truly grasp its extraordinance. And once you use it, every other device will feel like a brick in your hand. You'll also have to be willing to splurge a bit, as the S25 Edge starts at $1,099 for the 256GB variant. That puts it right in between the S25 Plus ($999) and S25 Ultra ($1,299), both of which field larger batteries and more cameras. Should you find a competitive trade-in offer at a retailer or carrier store, then the S25 Edge and its unique design may be worth considering. Who should look elsewhere: While the price of the S25 Edge is one barrier to entry, I'd put it after the most significant caveat, which is battery life. With only a 3,900mAh capacity -- smaller than the standard Galaxy S25's 4,000mAh) -- you should expect to charge the S25 Edge by late afternoon. As a power user, I often found myself topping up the phone before the end of my work shifts, which is not the most ideal if you're a frequent traveler or don't often have a charger nearby. Therefore, if endurance is a priority for you, I'd recommend the S25 Plus (4,900mAh) or Ultra (5,000mAh) models instead. If you're not a fan of Samsung's OneUI software, often criticized for having too many features and apps, it may also be worthwhile to wait for Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air, another thin phone that runs on iOS instead.

Serious mobile photographers will also find the camera system basic. As an alternative, I'd highly recommend the Google Pixel 8a, which offers a more reliable software and camera experience.

While previous comparisons have placed Apple ahead of Samsung regarding the overall phone experience, Samsung is arguably the best option in 2025. One reason is the variety of models across different price points, from the A-series that encapsulates the sub-$500 market to the S-series for premium shoppers. Having tested the latest handsets from both brands (and others), I find that the Samsung Galaxy continues to offer the most features and capabilities at relatively competitive prices. When compared to the Google Pixel lineup specifically, Samsung wins out by having a more robust software experience, with greater customizability for users to modify settings, home screen setups, app behaviors, and more. Historically, Google has leaned on Samsung to debut the latest software features, such as Circle to Search and enhanced Gemini, so you can count on Galaxy phones to field more innovative capabilities sooner. Overall, the popularity of Samsung is a key asset to the brand, as there's a greater variety of cases and accessories, as well as more certified repair technicians for after-sales support.

Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra The top-of-the-line flagship Samsung phone with all the bells and whistles in a traditional form factor. It's pricier than most, but is worth the money if you want a no-frills handset that can do just about everything. Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus A Galaxy phone capable of accomplishing 90% of what the Ultra model can do and costs less. The Galaxy S25 Plus is also slightly smaller, making it easier to manage. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 A tablet/smartphone hybrid foldable and one of the most innovative Samsung devices available. It's arguably the best foldable phone on the market, too. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge An ultra-thin and lightweight phone that doesn't compromise on performance. If you're ready to ditch bulkier handsets (and willing to pay for it), this is one of the first of its kind. Samsung Galaxy A36 5G You're shopping on a $400 budget. Even then, you'll receive a generous suite of premium features like a 120Hz OLED, a triple-camera setup, and a long-lasting battery.

Here are the key factors that we look for when curating the top picks. Design : Unlike how we would compare the best Android phones, comparing Samsung phones across different price points mostly boils down to the hardware. How a phone is designed, what materials the manufacturer chooses, and whether the device can take a hit or two are considered when picking the very best.\n\n: Unlike how we would compare the best Android phones, comparing Samsung phones across different price points mostly boils down to the hardware.

Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone in 2025:\n\nSpeeding up your smartphone\n\nSomething I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access (rules were meant to be broken, right?).\n\nTo turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times, and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From there, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from 1x (default) to 0.5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.\n\nOptimizing your battery health\n\nTo preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn (or degrade) the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.\n\nWhen in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.\n\nHow to keep your phone clean\n\nUnless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Samsung Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at 1 meter.\n\nAlso: Best satellite phones: Models tested from SpaceX, Garmin, & More\n\nWhat other Samsung phones are releasing in 2025?\n\nSamsung just wrapped up its July Unpacked event, where it announced the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 devices to the public, so all eyes are now on its rumored tri-foldable phone, which the company first teased back in January, when it suggested that there were several untapped form factors the company was exploring.\n\nMore recently, Samsung's Head of Mobile Experience, TM Roh, told The Korea Times that the company is gearing up to launch a tri-foldable phone by the end of the year. If true, we may see an upcoming foldable phone that bends in two ways, with a display that surpasses even the Z Fold 7 in ingenuity.\n\nWhile Samsung wouldn't be the first to do it -- the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate gets that honor -- it could be the first to launch a phone of such nature in the broader international market, including the US.\n\nFAQ on smartphones in 2025 Which Samsung phones will get Android 15? The latest version of Android, Android 15, is coming the latest Samsung Galaxy phones, starting with the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7. Compatible models include Galaxy S series (S21 or newer), Galaxy Z series (Z Flip 3 or newer), Galaxy A series (A14 or newer), Galaxy F series (F15 or newer), Galaxy M series (M15 or newer), and Galaxy Tab series (Tab S8 or newer). Show more What Samsung models support the One UI 8 update? Samsung's One UI 8 has officially launched, starting with the latest Galaxy S25 series of smartphones. It's expected to come to older models, too, including the Galaxy S21 series and newer, Z Flip and Fold 3 series and newer, and A16 series and newer. Select M and F series smartphones will also receive the One UI 8 update. Show more Which is best, Samsung Galaxy A or S? While the A and S series of Samsung Galaxy phones cater to two different customers, there is an overlap in features and designs making both models worthy of consideration. You should buy the A series if... You want a great-value smartphone that won't break the bank (less than $500).\n\nThere's a generous installment plan or sign-on offer from your carrier. You should buy the S series if... You want the most premium smartphone experience that Samsung offers and don't mind paying for it.\n\nYou value innovation and/or having the best display and camera performance. Show more What is the newest Samsung phone? The newest Samsung phones are the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, both of which launched during the company's July Unpacked event, and feature foldable designs that balance flagship mobile performance with portable form factors. Show more Which Samsung phone has the best camera? The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has the best camera of any Samsung phone and one of the best overall cameras on the market. It features a 200MP main camera along with four accompanying cameras, allowing it to take extremely high-quality shots, including close-up images and ultrawide photos. The S25 Ultra can also video record in up to 8K UHD quality at 30fps, making it one of the most capable phone cameras money can buy. Show more Is the Samsung S23 worth buying? Two years later, the Samsung Galaxy S23 is still worth buying. Compared to 2024 and 2025 S series phones, the previous generation mainly falls short on Galaxy AI features and camera performance. Even then, for a now depreciated selling price, the Galaxy S23 covers a good 80% of the S25 experience. That makes it the perfect alternative to the latest Samsung phones, even if they're now two years older. Show more Does Samsung have the best Android phone? The ZDNET team ran extensive tests on the top Android phones in 2025, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra took the top spot, with one of the sharpest and most color-accurate displays on the market, ample amount of RAM and storage, and an exceptional camera system that's reliable even in dimmer environments.

That's the beauty of the current landscape, which spans from the best foldable phones, like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, that challenge the status quo, to cheap phones, like the CMF Phone 2 Pro and Google Pixel 9a, that cater to consumers on a budget. Just this month, Samsung kicked off hot foldable summer with two new releases, and I expect other phone makers to follow suit in 2025.\n\nOf all the top handsets we've tried and tested at ZDNET, the best Android phones offer a robust hardware-software package with just enough innovation to keep the user excited.\n\nWhat is the best Android phone right now?\n\nI thoroughly test every Android phone that makes its way onto my desk, spending at least two weeks (and up to months) with each device before deciding whether it fits within ZDNET's buying guide.

The new Galaxy AI embedded in the device brings a slew of generative AI capabilities, including real-time phone call translations, multi-app AI voice prompts, enhanced photo editing, and a new AI Select tool that offers contextual shortcuts based on what you hover over. Notably, I've found that most of these features outperform AI tools offered by competing Android phones regarding speed, reliability, and practicality. Like its predecessor, the S24 Ultra, the S25 Ultra is built with a large 6.9-inch AMOLED and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. It helps that the S25 Ultra is made of a lightweight yet durable titanium frame and features Corning's Gorilla Armor 2, which is ideal for users who worry about damaging or scuffing up their devices. Under the hood, the S25 Ultra includes an upgraded Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset for improved graphics and AI features and 12GB of RAM. From our testing, the Qualcomm processor not only yields greater day-to-day performance but also improved power efficiency for longer endurance (roughly nine hours of typical use per charge). Lastly, the big upgrade for the new camera system is a 50MP ultrawide lens that produces greater detail and vividness when capturing landscape and macro shots. Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Who it's for: Although the price of the S25 Ultra is still fairly inaccessible at $1,299, the phone's upgrades make it well worth it for users holding onto three to four-year-old devices, and are looking to switch to something more capable. The S25 Ultra retains last year's anti-reflection screen which, when paired with the larger cooling chamber, makes it a fantastic multimedia device and easy to use when outdoors. If money is no object, or you score a competitive offer from your local carrier or retailer, then the S25 Ultra is the best phone you can buy today. Who should look elsewhere: With the S25 Ultra, you'll have to live with the fact that the S Pen no longer supports Bluetooth gestures, which previously allowed users to snap with a click of the stylus key. And if you're tight on budget or not a fan of the Ultra model's boxier footprint, I'd recommend a lower-tier S25 model or check out the OnePlus 13. Both options offer similar features but for less money.

Samsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches. Naturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the \"inferior\" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature. Review: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Who it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr. This ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this. Who should look elsewhere: With a starting price tag of $1,999, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead. Users shopping for a foldable phone should consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits.

Compared to the latest Google Pixel 9a and Apple iPhone 16e, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro fields a transparent glass backing that's decorated with screws and data ribbons underneath. This is all accented with the brand's popular Glyph interface, an array of LEDs that shine and sparkle depending on incoming notifications, calls, timers, and more. It's a hardware package that makes other midrange phones look outdated and should appeal to fashion-forward users or folks who value innovation above all else. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is rather competitive in specs, too, with a 6.77-inch 120Hz display that's larger and brighter (up to 3,000 nits) than its closest competitors. While it's only a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset powering the system -- meaning it won't breeze past Fortnite runs at max graphics -- I've found the processor good enough for daily browsing, social media consumption, and streaming movies. Review: Nothing Phone 3a Pro Who it's for: If bang for your buck is what you're after, consider the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. It's a great-value handset that's designed to appeal to tech enthusiasts, trailblazers, and fashion-forward consumers. It also has a rather minimal software experience that will please users looking for a bloatware-free interface. Still, there's just enough easter eggs across widgets, settings, and customization options to prevent you from getting bored. Who should look elsewhere: Of course, some limitations are expected from a phone in this price range, such as a less-capable camera system that can be inconsistent in contrast levels and color (e.g., making the sky appear muted or not having much depth between the subject and background). There's also no wireless charging support, a typical omission in this price range but still an annoyance for users who have adopted the technology. If that's a feature you require, I'd recommend the Google Pixel 9a instead. The last thing to note is that the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is only available through the company's Beta Program, at least here in the US. It's free to join but requires you to sign up on its website to buy the phone, meaning the Phone 3a Pro is unavailable at your local retailer or carrier store. That may be a dealbreaker for some.

Compared to the latest Google Pixel 9a and Apple iPhone 16e, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro fields a transparent glass backing that's decorated with screws and data ribbons underneath. This is all accented with the brand's popular Glyph interface, an array of LEDs that shine and sparkle depending on incoming notifications, calls, timers, and more.

For $899, it's very difficult to find a better flagship phone deal right now. Putting the value aspect aside, the OnePlus 13 shines with its charging speed; it's something I've learned to not take for granted, as competing Android flagships tend to require hours longer to top up. From my tests, the phone's 80W wired charging can power it from 0% to 50% within 10 minutes, with a full charge taking less than 30 minutes. That's compared to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, for example, which takes more than an hour to fully charge with its 45W standard. OnePlus also includes the 80W charger in the box, a free bonus that will benefit users who don't want to spend any more on accessories and are always on the go. Another vantage point is the OnePlus 13's IP69 rating, which laps its predecessor, the OnePlus 12, in water resistance. By IP69 standards, the phone can withstand high-pressure, high-temperature water jets and humidity changes. In other words, leaving the device in a washer and dryer, or even dropping it in a pot of boiling soup, won't damage it. Review: OnePlus 13 Who it's for: The OnePlus 13 starts at $899, which is cheaper than its closest (current) competitors, the $999 Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus and Google Pixel 9 Pro. The price point alone makes it worthy of recommending to consumers looking for a flagship phone experience without needing to fork up $1,000 or more. For the money, you'll also get the fastest charging speeds on the US market, great for users who are always on the go or require as much power as possible in a given time. Who should look elsewhere: While the OnePlus 13 hits almost every mark from our testing, alternatives like the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus are more readily available at carrier stores and promise longer software support, both of which are ideal for users looking for a device they can hold onto for the next 5+ years. The OnePlus 13 also falls short when it comes to video-recording, with our tests exposing its inconsistent HDR capturing, color processing, and imperfect stabilization.

But more often than not, Google's Pixel camera system takes the cake, with the latest Pixel 9 Pro models outpacing the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro when it comes to shutter speed (to capture fast-moving subjects like cars and sports), post-processing, and color accuracy. Of course, real-time capturing is only half the battle with mobile photography; there's also post-processing and the flexibility of devices with editing and tweaking subjects. In that regard, the Pixel 9 Pro, powered by a Tensor G4 chipset, may just have the most flexible and creative photo toolbox on the market, with AI features like Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and Best Take that allow you to modify the pictures you capture to achieve the best (or most ideal) shot. Both the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL feature a reliable triple lens setup based on our tests, with a 50MP primary lens, a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens that's great for users looking to capture distant subjects like statues and buildings. They're backed by useful software features like Google's Super Res Zoom (for up to 30x zoom photos), 8K video upscaling, and a new Add Me feature that lets you snap and merge two photos -- useful for family photos and during times when you don't have a spare cameraman. Review: Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Who it's for: It certainly helps that the Google Pixel 9 Pro series, which includes the $899 Pro and $1,099 Pro XL, undercut Apple and Samsung's flagship phones. (That's not counting the occasional deals we've seen during major holiday and commerce events.) For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs $1,199, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs $1,299. Therefore, we recommend the Pixel to customers who are aggressively searching for a good phone deal. Users who prefer a less bloated software experience should also consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro series over its Android competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S25 and OnePlus 13, as Google's Pixel launcher is free of unnecessary third-party apps. The Google Pixel line is also among the first to receive the latest Android software features, an aspect that should appeal to enthusiasts and developers. Who should look elsewhere: While the Pixel 9 Pro series performs well for photo capturing, if you're looking for a phone camera that specializes more in video-capturing (especially with Pro modes), I'd recommend the iPhone 16 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, both of which have better image stabilization and motion-smoothening.

I went hands-on with the new Razr Ultra model earlier this year, and was thoroughly impressed by the improved hinge system (read: the phone feels sturdier to flip open and close), as well as the performance, which is underpinned by an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM. Motorola's outer display still supports virtually any app you throw at it, meaning you can browse the web, play games, scroll TikTok, and do other mobile tasks without ever needing to flip open the device. Samsung's platform is more limited in this regard, which always felt like a missed opportunity when testing. It also helps that the Razr Ultra has a textured backing, including new Alcantara and Wood finishes, which I've found to be easier to hold and grip than competing flip phones. Considering how fragile these foldable devices can be -- anything with so many moving parts typically are -- the enhanced grip is easy to appreciate. Review: Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) Who it's for: At $1,299, the Razr Ultra is not a cheap flip phone by any means. That's why its more affordable siblings, the Razr and Razr Plus, exist. But if you want the most complete, durable, and visually-stimulating flip phone on the market right now, you'll have to pay to play with the Razr Ultra. I applauded Motorola for exploring new color and material finishes with this year's Razr, and that's something fashion-forward users will likely favor too. The battery on this year's model -- 4,700mAh, up from 4,000mAh -- is also much larger, which you can never really complain about. Who should look elsewhere: When buying the Razr Ultra, you should also consider aspects like Motorola's relatively short software update cadence, which ranges from 2 to 3 years, versus Google and Samsung's 7 years. If you're looking for a phone that's even more forgiving when dropped, I'd invest in a traditional slab handset instead, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series or iPhone 16 Pro series.

All of these phones run the same base operating system, but the user interfaces range from stock Android to more elaborate options. First, you need to figure out which best fits your needs. Camera performance across the board is solid for just about every phone on the list, but some are better than others. If you plan to capture photos as your primary function, you should look to Google, Samsung, or even OnePlus. If you plan to spend $1,000 or more, you may also want your phone to last at least a couple of years. You should consider companies with a good track record of regular updates, notably Google and Samsung, which currently promise seven years of software support. Choose this Android phone… If you want… Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra The overall best with nearly no compromises. Buy this phone if you want a device that delivers on display and camera quality, AI features, and battery life. It also comes with an S Pen stylus for precision inputs.

Customizability remains one of the biggest vantage points of Android, even though Apple has done a commendable job over the past two to three iOS versions to give its users more autonomy. You can also expect Android phones to support the most innovative features in the mobile industry, like foldable displays and faster USB-C charging. The caveat of being more experimental is that Android phones are generally not as consistent and reliable as iPhones. On the flip side, iPhones are notorious for their stability and ease of use. If you're not one to tinker with your gadgets, then you'll fit right into the iOS ecosystem. Features like iMessage and FaceTime are also key differentiators when comparing iPhones to Android. Those two features alone can dictate your decision. Show more\n\nKerry Wan's smartphone advice\n\nI've used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset. Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone in 2025:\n\nSpeeding up your smartphone\n\nSomething I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access (but rules were meant to be broken, right?).\n\nAlso: Best phones for battery life: Great battery, even better performance\n\nTo turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times, and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From there, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from 1x (default) to 0.5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.\n\nOptimizing your battery health\n\nTo preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn (or degrade) the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.\n\nWhen in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.\n\nHow to keep your phone clean\n\nUnless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Samsung Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at 1 meter deep.\n\nFAQ on smartphones When do new phones come out? While the year just started, we can look at past industry trends to understand when new phones will be released. Below is a list of expected release dates/timeframe for major phones in 2025. Samsung Galaxy S25 series: January\n\nOnePlus 13 series: January\n\nApple iPhone 16e: February\n\nGoogle Pixel 9a: March\n\nMotorola Razr Ultra: May\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge: May\n\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7: July\n\nGoogle Pixel 10 series: August\n\nApple iPhone 17 series: September Show more When is the Google Pixel 10 series expected to release? Google recently confirmed that its next \"Made by Google\" hardware event, which showcases the company's latest Pixel, Nest, and other products, will take place on August 20, 2025 in New York. At this summer's product event, we're expecting the company to debut the new Pixel 10 Series, featuring the standard Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold, alongside new Pixel Watches and earbuds. Show more What is the best brand for Android phones? The beauty of Android is that you have a lot of options. So the answer to \"Which brand is best?\" depends on your feature, user interface, and design preferences. If you prefer a more minimalistic approach to hardware and software, Google's Pixel line will serve you best. If you want everything but the kitchen sink in a smartphone, go with Samsung. For more unique value propositions like ultra-fast charging and a smooth interface, give OnePlus phones a try. Budget is also worth considering, but today, every major manufacturer, including Google and Samsung, offers Android phones in every price category (budget, mid-range, and premium) so it won't be your biggest decider. Show more What is the most reliable smartphone brand? In the grand scheme, Apple is the most reliable smartphone brand, with the longest, most consistent support of all manufacturers. If we're looking at Android makers only, then Samsung would take the crown, with a promise of up to seven years of software updates for its latest phones, expansive carrier support across the US (and overseas), and one of the most reliable repair and insurance infrastructures. Show more How long does an Android phone last? Most Android phones today should last at least seven years. For example, the latest handsets from Google and Samsung come with up to seven years of software support, meaning they'll receive updates and security patches for the long term. Of course, this applies more to flagship and some mid-range phones, whereas budget devices that sell for $300 and less tend to receive shorter commitments. Also: How to find out what apps are draining your Android phone's battery How you handle and use your phone will also determine its lifespan. It's highly advised not to keep your phone charged overnight as that can trigger faster battery degradation. It also helps to put on a case and/or screen protector to keep the device's hardware functioning properly. If it ever feels like your phone isn't lasting as long as it once did, consider swapping out its battery before replacing it with a new device altogether. Show more Which Android version is best? The latest version of Android is 99% of the time also the best version. At the moment, that's Android 16. Show more What is the latest version of Android in 2025? The latest version of Android is Android 16, which debuted with the Google Pixel series, has officially launched across major Android models, including Samsung and OnePlus. Android 16 features new tools like Live Updates, which display real-time tickers on the notification bar, auto-grouping of alerts, desktop windowing, accessibility enhancements, and better security and privacy in general. Show more Which phones get Android 16? The latest version of Android is supported by most smartphone releases in recent years, including the following: Google Pixel 6 series to Pixel 9 series (foldables included)\n\nSamsung Galaxy S22 series to S25 series (foldables and A-series models included)\n\nOnePlus 11 to OnePlus 13 series\n\nSelect Sony, Motorola, Nothing, Xiaomi, Honor, Vivo, and Oppo models Show more Which phone OS is most secure? To generalize, most consumers will be choosing between iOS and Android, and between the two, iOS is the more secure operating system. The main reason is that the abundance of Android phones and app makers means there are more opportunities for hackers and data thieves to access your personal information and/or install malware. How these attacks are prevented and managed varies across manufacturers, with some OEMs like Google doing a better job than others like Xiaomi. While iOS on iPhones may feel more restrained and limited in customizations, that results in a more protected and secure software experience, from app availability on the store to how you download files online. Show more Can I use eSIM on an Android phone? While Apple's iPhone 14 made headlines for its eSIM integration, the digital service also works -- and has for some time -- with Android devices, including the latest Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, and OnePlus smartphone. As always, it's best practice to consult with your local carrier before converting to eSIM. Show more What is the best small Android phone? Besides the Motorola Razr Ultra, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is a worthy runner-up, with a 6.2-inch AMOLED, up to 512GB of storage, and a flat-edge design that makes it all the easier to manage with one hand. During ZDNET's testing, the small-but-mighty Android proved capable of handling apps and services typically run on larger devices.

{"url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smart-ring/", "title": "The best smart rings of 2025: I tested and found an obvious winner", "authors": "[\"Nina Raemont\", \"Editor\", \"Wearables\", \"Health Tech\", \"Allison Jewell\"]", "published": null, "text": "At this point in the smart ring race, everyone is trying to beat Oura. But the Oura Ring 4 proves that the smart ring pioneer's position isn't wavering anytime soon. While most smart rings simply provide you with collected health data, the Oura Ring 4 tells you the story and the context behind that data for greater information on your health.\n\nWhy we like it: What separates the Oura Ring 4 from its competition is its commitment to helpful and actionable health insights that can change or encourage healthy behaviors. As someone who has used the Oura Ring 3 and Oura Ring 4 for over a year, I can attest to the smart ring's health and sleep data illustrations and recommendations that have changed my habits for the better. It doesn't just tell me my sleep or readiness score - it tells me why I got a poor sleep score by showing a graph of when my heart rate dropped that night, and how that drop in heart rate led to a low or high score. Then, it explains how factors like alcohol, exercise, or meal timing influence sleep timing, and thus, sleep and readiness scores.\n\nThe Oura Ring app's data illustrations provide the right amount of information about my night's sleep, yesterday's activities, and overall stress patterns - and supplement this daily data with long-term trends that can paint a fuller picture of my overall health. Still, the data rarely feels overwhelming, and even on nights when I've gone to bed too late or on days when I'm inactive, the smart ring's nudges and summaries never skew demanding or judgmental.\n\nWho's it for: Unlike other smart rings that focus on day-to-day health, the Oura Ring is for people who want to assess both their short-term and long-term overall health. This could be someone managing a health condition or an aging person who wants to detect early signs of strain. For example, its daytime stress data that it collects translates into a long-term resilience status that illustrates how quickly an Oura wearer bounces back from high stress. Through its daily activity information it monitors, you can learn about your long-term cardio capacity and cardiovascular age to get a sense of general heart health.\n\nOura's smart ring (and subsequent monthly subscription) tends to cost more than its competitors because of the constant research and product development, as well as the features that go beyond daily monitoring. So the smart ring will also be best for people who are willing to pay that expensive starting price of $350 (plus the $72 annual subscription).\n\nIf I could paint the Oura Ring's ideal customer, it would be one who is willing to splurge on a sleep and health-tracking device to regularly check their health data and who is looking for data-driven suggestions and innovative features to improve their overall wellness. It's also got the smallest and largest ring sizes out of all the smart rings on this list, so if a customer hasn't found the right fit in other smart rings, they will probably find a good fit with the Oura Ring.\n\nWho should look elsewhere: I'd recommend the Ultrahuman Ring Air if you want similarly innovative health features without the added subscription cost. If you don't need innovative health features to understand your long-term health and just want to check your sleep and readiness score, I'd recommend the Galaxy Ring, which costs a similar price of $350, or the RingConn Gen 2 Air, which costs $200, the cheapest price on this list.\n\nOura Ring Gen 4 tech specs: Material: Lightweight titanium with non-allergenic, non-metallic inner molding | Battery life: Up to 8 days | Charging: Full charge in 20 to 80 minutes | Compatibility: iOS and Android | Durability: Water-resistant up to 328 feet | Sizing: 4 to 15 | FSA and HSA eligible", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"rings\", \"oura\", \"overall\", \"longterm\", \"ring\", \"sleep\", \"tested\", \"obvious\", \"smart\", \"best\", \"health\", \"data\", \"score\", \"2025\", \"winner\"]", "content_hash": "a0048f60628b109dcea11cb5b08e7a1f45c0fbd88d8078f0997131b66dfe014e", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:03.244039+00:00"}

Once the Sleepbuds are in your ears, they produce noise-masking (not noise-canceling) white noise that's dialed at the perfect volume to reduce external distractions and help you quickly fall asleep (and you don't even need to connect them with a phone or the app for this to work). My bedroom overlooks a bustling Brooklyn street that is always polluted with noise, like police sirens, screaming ambulances, neighbors singing and celebrating into the wee hours of the night, and pedestrians yelling at each other. These earbuds simplified my descent into sleep -- I put these earbuds in and couldn't hear a song or chatter outside my window.\n\nIf you download the app, you can customize your sleep sounds with up to 10 to choose from, set up an alarm in the earbuds, and put a timer on the earbuds for them to shut down after you've gone to bed. Some features, like sleep tracking, will also be coming soon in an over-the-air app update.\n\nAs far as comfort goes, you won't find a sleep earbud that's more comfortable to sleep in. This is thanks to the stabilizing ear wings that keep the buds in place without additional pressure buildup (that tends to cause soreness and sensitivity). I'm a side sleeper and found these the most comfortable to wear as I turned from one side of my head to the other. In my review, I write that they dissolved into my ears, becoming nearly invisible as I fell asleep, which is all that you really want out of a sleep earbud.\n\nWho should buy them\n\nOf course, $300 is still a pretty penny to pay for a decent night of uninterrupted sleep. But the Ozlo Sleepbuds are the best earbuds for a reason: they have a thoughtful design, are an effective sound-masking technology, and are a comfortable fit that makes me want to wear them every night.\n\nIf I could describe the Ozlo Sleepbuds' perfect customer, it would be someone who has a noisy partner or bedroom conditions that prevent them from easily falling asleep. They have some money to spend on the finest sleep earbuds on the market. Maybe they're a side sleeper and are seeking out a sleep earbud that will feel comfortable as they lie on their side.\n\nWho should look elsewhere\n\nIf $350 is too much to spend right now, I'd suggest the Anker A20 sleep earbuds, which also produce noise-masking soundscapes and offer a flat, comfortable fit, but are half the price.\n\nAlso: I actually want to put these $350 sleep earbuds in my ears every night\n\nOzlo Sleepbuds tech specs: Form factor: Earbuds | Connectivity: Bluetooth | Battery: 10 hours in the earbuds | Fit: In-ear", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"sleepbuds\", \"ears\", \"ozlo\", \"asleep\", \"wear\", \"app\", \"sleep\", \"comfortable\", \"expert\", \"tested\", \"best\", \"earbuds\", \"headphones\", \"2025\", \"fit\"]", "content_hash": "e3279538eb4d23acefbe6d4baf1b5ff4f7b1ea802583b13b04b29feb2d8a6917", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:04.883158+00:00"}

Review: NordVPN NordVPN supports all major platforms and has Firefox, Edge, and Chrome browser plugins. The company offers 10 simultaneous device connections under one account, although I would like to see this become limitless in the future, as some cheaper services have no such restrictions. Overall, NordVPN is one of the best VPNs. The server network includes 111 countries, offering you a wide range of location options to choose from. Regarding user data, the firm's fifth independent assurance has backed its no-logs claims. Who it's for: NordVPN will suit most users, considering its reasonable price point, excellent speeds, user-friendly and interactive user interface, and strong server network. I've found it performs well while abroad, including when connected to rather unstable Wi-Fi points.

Customers said this VPN is pricey, but it provides good value for money, as well as solid customer support. Who should look elsewhere: Anyone who considers $4.99 per month for a VPN as too much, as there are many other more affordable VPNs on the market today, such as NordVPN and Surfshark. Two-year contracts are priced at $5 per month, with four months of free access added to the subscription term. One-year plans cost $6.67 per month with three months free. ExpressVPN accepts Google Pay and Apple Pay as payment options alongside payment cards and provides a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Why we like it: Speeds are reasonable, especially when you consider the price point. They can be slower than competitors, but not to a drastic degree. This is also a beginner-friendly VPN with a clean and easy-to-understand user interface. That said, my tests have found that initial server connections can be slow. Review: Surfshark VPN I particularly like the option to disconnect or pause your VPN for five minutes, 30 minutes, or two hours. You can also select a server from 100 countries. Surfshark VPN offers many features, including split tunneling, a kill switch to keep your connection secure if it drops, double VPN MultiHop, static and rotating IP addresses, and an ad-blocker. There are also inexpensive add-ons, including a tracker-free search engine, a data breach scanner, and an antivirus. In May, Surfshark also the launch of new domain name service (DNS) servers to provide users with additional anonymity and potentially improve connection times. Who it's for: Individuals who want an affordable, secure VPN. The company doesn't log your activity while you use the service and offers private DNS capabilities, which Surfshark calls mode. This feature lets you access sites regardless of restrictive border connections. Be careful -- countries that limit access tend to frown upon attempts to bypass those restrictions. Surfshark subscriptions start at $2 per month for a two-year plan and $3.19 per month for a one-year plan. One- and two-year plans give customers three months of free access, which is added to the length of the contract. Surshark is also now through the MSI Rewards Program. Alternatively, you can sign up for one month for $15.45. I don't recommend this, though -- instead, take advantage of Surfshark's 30-day money-back guarantee. Customers applaud Surfshark's customer service, but some have noted billing issues. Who should look elsewhere?

A travel VPN service is a virtual private network best suited for when you leave your home country. This means it will provide you with a server network spanning multiple countries, cities, and towns, allowing you to shift your 'location' to somewhere else entirely -- bypassing internet censorship, geo-restrictions, and potentially even allowing you to access different streaming content libraries by region. Also: Best VPNs for streaming 2025: I've tested Netflix libraries worldwide so you don't have to Furthermore, a travel-ready VPN should be compatible with a variety of operating systems and devices, and it should implement strong encryption and other security measures to protect your privacy.

When you are deciding on the most suitable travel VPN, consider the following factors: Price : VPN prices vary, and although the most expensive services can cost you upwards of $10 to $20 per month, you can also find solid, reliable VPNs for as little as a few dollars per month. That said, you may be interested in paying top rates if you want additional features, such as a password manager or reliable connections in countries such as China.\n\n: VPN prices vary, and although the most expensive services can cost you upwards of $10 to $20 per month, you can also find solid, reliable VPNs for as little as a few dollars per month.

Trial length : You need to consider how long you think you will need a VPN. If you're in it for the long haul, consider a two-year subscription -- as you also tend to get the best monthly prices on the longest terms. Some VPNs will offer more extended options, but if you're only traveling for a month, you might be willing to pay a little extra so that you are not tied to a longer contract.\n\n: You need to consider how long you think you will need a VPN.

Software, including VPNs, is not usually directly impacted by tariffs. However, software does require a physical infrastructure, and the equipment required to run a VPN network, like servers, may become more expensive or difficult to acquire. In turn, this may lead to higher pricing in the future. While VPN software is not in the firing line yet, the White House's original tariff announcement became a catalyst for stock market fluctuations and the panic-buying of some consumer goods. A temporary stay of execution for tariffs on electronics is currently in place. Show more\n\nTravel VPN FAQs What is a VPN? A VPN is a virtual private network that allows you to browse the internet privately and securely, including when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. VPNs allow you to change your virtual location by redirecting the connection through servers around the world. A VPN can also encrypt your traffic, keeping your online activities hidden from prying eyes. If your online activities are monitored at the internet service provider (ISP) level -- say, by a government -- the snoopers may recognize your VPN's \"signature.\" While they can't see the details of what you're doing, they will know that you're using a VPN. VPNs can also be useful in unblocking geo-restricted content and can be a vital tool for accessing information in countries with repressive governments. They are essential services for anyone who wants to maintain their security and privacy online. Show more Will a travel VPN slow down my internet speed? A VPN might slow your internet speed if the data is encrypted and decrypted before transmission. A good travel VPN should have a minimal impact on your speed, and the added security is worth the slight speed loss. If you use a public hotspot or hotel connection while you're away, your speed will likely be slow at the source and not as fast as you are used to at home. Show more What should I do if I experience traffic slowdowns with a VPN? If you experience traffic slowdowns, check the VPN and Wi-Fi connection between your device, router, or access point. Sometimes, connectivity issues begin at the source, and in other cases, switching your selected VPN server may be enough to resolve speed problems or connectivity drops. Keep in mind that if you are on the road, and you are relying on a free hotspot or hotel connection, your base speed may be lower and might not meet the standards of your home connection. Show more Are travel VPNs legal? Using a VPN is legal in most countries, but some exceptions exist. Some countries such as China, Russia, and Iran, restrict VPN usage or have banned them entirely. It's essential to research the local laws of the country you're traveling to before using a VPN. Show more How can I find out what the VPN rules are for the countries I'm visiting? There are several good sources. Reaching out to your VPN vendor is always a good idea. They often have a good feel for the countries in which their services operate and will frequently post guidance on their websites. If you're a U.S. citizen, consider using U.S. State Department resources. The department lists travel advisories for U.S. citizens and has foreign service officials who can provide general guidance. Check the travel advisories webpage. Your nation's foreign ministry may have a similar service if you're outside the US. If you're trying to understand which countries ban or discourage VPN usage, NordVPN has a legal guide that lists countries with severe restrictions, bans, and possible penalties for breaking VPN laws. Show more Is a VPN all I need to be protected online while traveling? No. VPNs can generally protect your data while it's in motion. If your computer or phone is seized, however, it's possible law enforcement can access your data, even if it's encrypted. Some governments might hold your devices without giving you a reason. Online services you access in another country might also have less protection than those in your host country. Also: Best antivirus for Windows of 2025 Show more What is a DNS leak, and why does it matter? A domain name service (DNS) leak is the exposure of your information -- such as DNS queries -- outside of secure, encrypted tunnels when you are using a VPN. If your activity is exposed, this compromises the whole point of using a virtual private network in the first place. As you can imagine, you don't want to use a travel VPN known for DNS leaks. Most reputable VPNs will prevent DNS leaks, but if you can, use an online service like DNS leak test to check your connection. Show more If my hotel has a wired connection, do I still need to use a VPN? Yes. Don't assume network endpoints are safe when you're traveling. Always make sure your connections are encrypted when communicating from any network connection. Show more Can a VPN help me save on airfare? Many VPN services claim you can save hundreds of dollars on flights by changing your location. Plenty of blog posts with anecdotal evidence support the theory that a VPN can help cut the price of your plane ticket. The reality is less clear, and the most likely scenario is that no one knows how much -- if at all -- a VPN can help you score cheap flights. Airfare prices are set by algorithms based on complicated factors, such as changing demand. You could notice a price difference using a VPN to spoof your location, but the change in cost may or may not be related to your location. Practically, it isn't easy to account for every possible variable. Also, given the amount of data available to consumers, the real advantage of using a VPN may be that it remains anonymous. Another way to look at it is if a VPN reduces the cost of airfare, it's most likely not going to have as big of an impact as other factors. There are different tactics for booking cheap flights that should be higher on your priority list. Booking early, keeping an eye out for price drops, check if there are change fees before booking, or traveling during days or times of day when there is less demand are great ways to secure the best possible flight prices. Show more Can a VPN make it look like I am in another country? Yes. You can choose your home country as a default location, but if you would prefer to have an IP assigned from a different country -- the U.S. rather than the U.K., for example -- you should be able to do so. The available locations vary depending on the VPN you are using. Show more Can I access my streaming service abroad? If you're a paid subscriber to a streaming service, such as Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video, you can often access your streaming service while you're away from home. You can use a VPN to change your IP address to another point of origin -- and if this is set to your home location, you should have access to your library. Using a VPN to access other libraries may go against your terms of service and the streaming platform's licensing agreements, so keep this in mind. Also: Best VPN for Fire TV Stick Show more Does a VPN incur roaming charges? No. A VPN network can help you simulate and appear from a location abroad, but this doesn't mean you'll face roaming charges imposed by your carrier. Unfortunately, a VPN will also not allow you to avoid roaming charges while you're away from home. Show more Should I use a VPN in my home country? Absolutely. You should consider using a VPN in your home country and abroad, as in both cases, you are still offered online protection, encrypted communication, and privacy tools. As long as VPN usage is legal, a VPN can be invaluable. Show more Do I pay for a VPN month by month? VPN providers usually market their pricing on a month-to-month basis. However, you usually pay for your chosen contract upfront when you purchase. For example, a VPN available for $3 per month will likely equate to $36 upfront on a yearly contract -- plus tax. An exception is Mullvad, which offers a month-by-month €5 -- or about $5.31 -- price, no matter how long you want to use the VPN for. You tend to enjoy the best discounts on VPN contracts when you sign up for longer terms. Two years is usually the longest term you can sign up for, although some VPN providers offer five-year subscriptions. Show more Why are VPN one-month plans so expensive? The simple answer is that VPN providers do not want users to pop in and out with four-week subscriptions. Instead, they hope to lure consumers with cheap one-year and two-year plans and will display the monthly equivalent price in marketing materials rather than the upfront payment. If you are interested in a VPN but don't want to pay upwards of $20 to try it out, we recommend you sign up for a longer term and take advantage of money-back guarantees. These refund windows are typically available for the first 30 days, although CyberGhost offers 45 days. You can then cancel before the end of this period.

They may also offer additional privacy features, including ad-blocking, phishing domain detection, data breach scanners, and password managers.\n\nWhat is the best VPN service right now?\n\nMy pick for the best overall VPN is NordVPN. Based in Panama and subject to strict data protection laws, NordVPN is a top contender in the VPN space. NordVPN offers the full package -- fast speeds, stable connections, an expansive server network, and excellent streaming capabilities. It's not the cheapest VPN, starting at $3.39 per month, but if you want a solid, versatile VPN backed by solid customer support, NordVPN is for you.\n\nMy second choice is ExpressVPN, a secure and easy-to-use VPN that provides users with some of the best speeds around.

It's secure, fast, suitable for streaming, and has all the features you'll likely need. Why we like it: NordVPN is fine for basic use but offers many features beyond a mere VPN tunnel, including support for peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and an optional second layer of encryption through Double VPN. This allows you to set up a dedicated IP address to run a VPN that also acts as a server. I've found it to be one of the fastest VPNs with the most consistent speed measurements and rapid initial server connectivity. It's still worth noting that rival ExpressVPN is slightly faster. In my tests with Netflix, NordVPN emerged as a top VPN for streaming content with a high success rate in accessing geo-blocked content. When set up with the Privacy Hero 2 router, it also did exceptionally well in accessing streaming services worldwide. This year, the company launched , a new protocol designed to allow users to connect to VPN servers from networks that typically limit traditional VPN traffic and have restrictive network policies. In a new service update, NordVPN has revealed the release of a full graphical user interface (GUI) for Linux. NordVPN also features a kill switch that activates if your connection suddenly drops, protecting your connection and data. In its fifth independent , NordVPN says its no-logs policy has been verified. Review: NordVPN: Consistent speed and performance Who it's for: Those who want the best overall VPN around.

NordVPN is compatible with all major platforms and provides a server network of 111 countries, and it allows you to connect 10 devices simultaneously under one account. It's also excellent for streaming. Who should look elsewhere: NordVPN will suit most users' needs, but if you want speed first, ExpressVPN might be the right alternative. You can pick between three types of plans with two-year, one-year, or one-month contract terms, depending on whether you want advanced features such as a password manager, data breach scanner, cloud storage, or file encryption.

Why we like it: Customers say it delivers a speedy and consistent connection, and I agree. NordVPN and ExpressVPN are well-matched in speed, but ExpressVPN often outperforms its closest competitor during the speed tests I perform every few months. It's one of the most popular VPN providers, offering a wide range of platforms, and is well-regarded and trusted. The service also has an expansive network with servers in 105 countries and has recently to include servers in every U.S. state. In total, eight simultaneous connections can be linked under a single account. I think this number of connections is restrictive, considering the higher price point of this VPN compared to many of its competitors. Compatible platforms include Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Fire OS, and tvOS. The service also works with Linux, which has been with a GUI. Review: ExpressVPN: Is it worth the price? The company doesn't log your browsing history, IP address, or traffic destination and operates a no-logs policy.

While customer service is friendly and polite, they persist in customer retention, so you'll need to set aside some time if you wish to cancel after the 30-day period.

Who should look elsewhere: VPN customers who want a budget-friendly option should consider Surfshark or another of my recommended VPNs. Considering the high price point of the subscriptions, I would eventually like to see ExpressVPN support unlimited simultaneous connections instead of just eight.

Who should look elsewhere: If streaming, speed, or a large server network are more important than open source technologies, consider another option. If you would like to give it a try, Private Internet Access offers two plans, including a two-year subscription for $2.19 per month, making it a very affordable VPN. If you want to try out the VPN for a shorter period, you can sign up for $7.50 per month for six months. The best deal is the two-year subscription, as you also get two months of free access.

Why we like it: Under the slogan \"privacy by default,\" this organization is focused on developing services -- including encrypted email and a VPN -- to enhance the privacy of activists, journalists, and the public. Proton VPN takes a solid approach to security, layering robust protocols on top of perfect forward secrecy and encryption. Not only does Proton VPN have a kill switch, but it also provides torrenting support, WireGuard, and an ad-blocker.

Customers like Proton's attitude to security and privacy. I find it easy to use, and the speeds are reasonable.

It allows one machine to connect without bandwidth limits and provides access to servers across five countries. I don't typically recommend using free VPNs, but if you want a service for casual browsing, you should consider this one.

I ran a series of speed and connectivity tests in July 2025 on each VPN's paid service to see how they compare. I performed the tests using a broadband connection in the U.K. with an average starting speed, without a VPN, of 59.3 Mbps download and 17.2 Mbps upload. (Yes, they are terrible, but they are the best the U.K. currently offers where I live.) I also tested for the presence of domain name service (DNS) leaks. Please remember that results may differ for you and vary from country to country, so the below should be considered a snapshot. Your internet service provider (ISP) and broadband subscription may also impact your speeds. For example, the starting speed is a snail's pace compared to some U.S. offerings. The below results are not the exact speeds you should expect. You can instead use these results to get a general idea of how your speeds could change with a VPN. Remember that the further away the VPN server, the more your speed may be impacted. Speeds will typically be quicker when you connect to a local server, compared to selecting Australia, for example, unless you're in Australia. Show more\n\nWhich is the right VPN for you? Choose this top VPN service... If you want... NordVPN The best VPN overall. NordVPN is one of the most consistently fast and stable VPN providers with a solid and large server network, giving you plenty of countries to connect to. It's great for streaming and travel, too, with a stylish user interface on PC and mobile. ExpressVPN One of the fastest VPNs with a large server network. I've used ExpressVPN for years, and I consider it one of the fastest and least obtrusive services available. You can expect multi-platform support and relatively minor speed downgrades when you are streaming. However, it isn't cheap. Surfshark VPN The least expensive top VPN based on my testing. Surfshark is a consistent entrant in my top VPN lists, and for good reason. It might not always be the fastest, but for the price point, you can't argue against its value for money. It's also perfect for beginners. Private Internet Access Unlimited simultaneous connections. Private Internet Access is a great choice if you want a set-and-forget, affordable VPN, but the interface won't suit everyone. Still, this VPN will support and protect as many devices as you like under one account, including your PC, smartphone, and even your smart TV. Proton VPN A variety of add-on features and the comfort of open-source security. Proton VPN is one of the most privacy-focused VPN services out there.

Speed: Every VPN performs differently, and every user experience differs. Your ISP will offer speeds that are not the same as someone in another location. Your favorite coffee shop has a different network connection than our local haunts. So, when you are testing a new VPN, keep your base speed in mind. Look out for VPN solutions with minimal speed loss.\n\nEvery VPN performs differently, and every user experience differs.

Free VPN providers: Running a VPN is expensive, and if the VPN provider doesn't make money from your service fees, they're going to make money from your data -- sometimes even by selling your personal information. Stick with the trusted commercial vendors we've tested or the handful of free plans we recommend. There are also cases where \"free\" VPNs undermine what the software is designed for -- data protection and security.\n\nRunning a VPN is expensive, and if the VPN provider doesn't make money from your service fees, they're going to make money from your data -- sometimes even by selling your personal information.

To set up a VPN, you will first need to subscribe to a VPN service and download the VPN software. You can visit the VPN service's official website, or you may receive a download link through email. Alternatively, visit Google Play or the App Store for mobile app options.\n\nOpen the software, provide any associated permissions the VPN needs, and sign in using your credentials.\n\nZDNET | Charlie Osborne\n\nChoose a server location and connect to the VPN. In this example, you can select ExpressVPN's \"...\" button to select a server from its list of countries. Most VPNs will give you a \"smart\" location set as default, typically close to home.\n\nAlso: Best VPNs for Smart TVs\n\nIt's that simple! Of course, you can check out your VPN's settings and tailor your experience to your liking. However, for many users, sticking to default options and having a few favorite servers will be enough.\n\nHow I test VPNs I tested and analyzed the best VPNs in 2025 using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision: Performance: My top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags. I frequently conduct speed tests to stay up to date and informed of any service changes.\n\n\n\nMy top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance.

Windscribe has stepped in to offer some users a complimentary six-month subscription.\n\nA free 'VPN' hosted on GitHub has been unmasked as information-stealing malware.\n\nRoskomnadzor, Russia's federal media agency and regulator, has sent a wave of VPN takedown requests to Google in an apparent effort to wage war against VPN use in the country.\n\nVPNs have formally been deemed a \"key challenge\" to investigative work and law enforcement agencies by the EU's HLG (High Level Group).\n\nWindscribe founder Yegor Sak has been acquitted after a two-year legal battle in which he was personally charged in connection with \"an alleged internet offence by an unknown user of the service.\"\n\nLegacy VPN Secure customers have been told their lifetime access won't be honored, according to reports. The decision comes following an acquisition of the VPN provider's assets. Show more\n\nIs VPN software impacted by tariffs? Recent tariff changes have not directly impacted Virtual Private Network software. Software is rarely considered in tariff alterations, and so subscription services should be safe, for now. However, this doesn't mean the industry as a whole will not be impacted, as associated hardware -- such as servers and networking equipment -- could be subject to higher costs. The White House has imposed temporary exemptions for electronics, but this could change at any time.

Just type a simple prompt and generate a visual representation of whatever you're imagining. The possibilities are endless.\n\nThese AI generators can be used for personal projects such as creating greeting cards, event invites, and wallpapers, or for professional projects such as developing brand assets, social media content, or marketing campaigns. There are so many AI image generators on the market that excel at different tasks, and to help you decide which to use for your needs, we tested all of the models and compiled all the findings below.\n\nTesting Methodology\n\nSince image generators became popular at the end of 2022, many advancements have been made. As a result, they are much more capable and can tackle complex prompts such as human faces and text in a highly realistic manner. I've been testing AI image generators since 2022 and have had to update my methodology several times to keep up with the pace.\n\nFor my most recent round of testing, I gave each image generator tool the same prompt: \"a person standing in front of the camera smiling with a green colorful pasture in the background with a sign that says 'green meadows'.\" I also included screenshots to help you decide which tool best matches your needs.\n\nAlso: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot and worthy alternatives\n\nFrom ChatGPT's brand-new GPT-4o image-generating model to more established competitors, such as Midjourney, there were some overall really impressive results. Some things to look out for are how well it outputs text, human characteristics, and the background. Because the first two are extra challenging to do well, it is worth separating each element from the others as you analyze the image, especially because you likely will have a use case that needs to be good at all three simultaneously.\n\nSince the image quality is only one factor in choosing an image generator, I also included details on cost, speed, accessibility, and other standouts from my testing. You can also filter the data based on your needs to reflect what you need to see the most.\n\nWhat is the best AI image generator overall?\n\nIn my most recent test, Google's Imagen 3 remains as the top free image generator, since it can produce realistic, detailed, results, including text. Its competitive advantage is that it is entirely free to access, and just as good as models that require hefty subscriptions, combining accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness and can generate images in seconds.\n\nAlso: Is that image real or AI? Now Adobe's got an app for that - here's how to use it\n\nHowever, in this round, ChatGPT's newest model is what really surprised me. OpenAI's DALL-E 2 made a huge splash as the first mainstream AI image generator. Since then, DALL-E 2 was discontinued and its more advanced model, DALL-E 3, also paled in comparison to competitor's models.\n\nHowever, OpenAI recently released its GPT-4o image generation model which is tremendously better than its predecessing models. It can tackle a range of tasks really well including people, scenery, text, posters, room renderings, and more. In addition, with the subscription that gets you higher limits, you can also access the entire suite of ChatGPT premium features, which even includes its Sora video generator. For that reason, it is the best AI-paid image generator.\n\nFor the full roundup of the best AI image generators, keep reading.\n\nSort by All Speed and performance User experience Price\n\nThe best AI art generators of 2025\n\nShow less View now at Gemini Google was an underdog in the image generator space, releasing its Imagen models months after its competitors.

Despite my experiences with different AI generators, nothing could have prepared me for Midjourney. The output of the images was so crystal clear that I had a hard time believing they weren't photos that someone had taken. The software has even produced award-winning art, and when you scroll through the gallery of user-generated images, it is not hard to see why. When it first launched, Midjourney's biggest flaw was that it wasn't very user-friendly. Since then, however, Midjourney has greatly simplified the process, launching a standalone webpage that makes it easy to get started.

Despite my experiences with different AI generators, nothing could have prepared me for Midjourney. The output of the images was so crystal clear that I had a hard time believing they weren't photos that someone had taken. The software has even produced award-winning art, and when you scroll through the gallery of user-generated images, it is not hard to see why. When it first launched, Midjourney's biggest flaw was that it wasn't very user-friendly. Since then, however, Midjourney has greatly simplified the process, launching a standalone webpage that makes it easy to get started.

An AI image generator is software that uses a generative AI model to create images from user text inputs, usually within seconds. The pictures vary in style depending on the software's capabilities, but they can typically be rendered in any style you want: 3D, 2D, cinematic, modern, Renaissance, and more. If you've ever searched Google for hours to find an image you needed, artificial intelligence (AI) may be able to help. With AI image generators, you can type in a prompt that is as detailed or vague as you'd like. These tools can help with branding, social media content creation, and making invitations, flyers, business cards, and more. Another major perk of these generators is that they take seconds to generate, with the longest generation taking about a minute. Even if you have no professional use for AI, don't worry -- the process is so fun that anyone can (and should) try it out. Show more\n\nDo you need to pay for AI image creators or are the free versions good enough? Ultimately, whether you should pay for an image generator or not depends on your use cases. If you are a business and need a commercially safe generator or the highest quality renditions, then paying for services like Midjourney or Generative AI by Getty Images makes sense. If you are a consumer looking to generate images occasionally for fun and leisure, then there are plenty of highly competent free AI image creators, and I would advise you not to pay for a subscription. Lastly, if you are a power AI user, many subscriptions, such as ChatGPT Plus, also include advanced AI and chatbot features that may make it worth it. Show more\n\nHow do you use AI image generators? Like other generative AI models, AI image generators require a lot of data. Typically, these models are trained on billions of images, which are then used to in turn create impressive images. Follow these simple steps to get started using one yourself: 1) Visit the website of the generator you are interested in using. 2) Sign in or create an account if the site requires you to have one to access the generator. 3) Type a detailed prompt about what you'd like the generator to output.

Show more\n\nHow did I compare these AI image generators? To find the best AI image generators, I tested each generator listed and compared their performance across UI/UX, image results, cost, speed, and availability. Each AI image generator had different strengths and weaknesses. UI/UX: The interface design and overall user experience are a big factor. Even though using an image generator should be as simple as typing in a text prompt, some platforms overcomplicate things, making it hard to get started.\n\nImage quality: If you use an image generator, it is likely because you want to produce high-quality art, pictures, or other media. Therefore, one of the biggest factors is the ability to create realistic and detailed images with as few artifacts as possible.\n\nPrice: There are so many great free AI image generators. We thus want to ensure that if you have to pay to use a model, it is worth every penny, since some free generators can produce incredible outputs.\n\nSpeed: Many image generators can produce images in seconds, setting the expectation for image generators to be quick. Therefore, it is noticeable when a model takes longer. Slowness is a significant con.\n\nSafety: The guardrails that the image generator has in place prevent spreading misinformation, creating deepfakes, and stealing artists' work are also heavily evaluated. Show more\n\nWhat's the future for AI image generators? Many AI image generators on the market shine in terms of speed, quality, and affordability. That said, there isn't much more I'd like to see from image generators that could significantly improve the offerings. Furthermore, the future of AI image generators isn't about updating current offerings, but rather moving from one-dimensional to three-dimensional renditions. Some companies, such as Stability AI, already have 3D object image generators, such as Stable Video 3D, which generates 3D objects from single images. Text-to-image video generation is also the next big thing, with many companies, including OpenAI, Google, and Stability AI, already working on their own generators.

For example, if you say, \"Generate an image of the beach,\" and are disappointed at the way the ocean looks, you can input another prompt that says, \"Generate an image of a beach with crystal blue, shallow water.\" The more specific you get, the better your result will be.\n\nAre there ethical implications with AI image generators?\n\nAI image generators are trained on billions of images from across the internet. These images are often artworks belonging to specific artists, which an AI tool repurposes to generate your image. Although the output is different, the new image has elements of the artist's original work that are not credited to them.\n\nAre AI-generated images copyrighted?\n\nWhether an AI-generated image is copyrighted depends on the terms of the generator you are using. The copyright policies also vary between subscription tiers. The best way to proceed is not to assume and to double-check before you use or publish a generated image.\n\nHow do I properly disclose that my images were AI-generated?\n\nA good habit when using AI to generate images is to disclose that AI was involved in the process. Doing so helps build trust with your audience, as well as helps prevent misinformation from spreading. A disclosure can be as simple as something that reads, \"Generated by [the name of the generator].\"\n\nYou will notice that at ZDNET, we always disclose when we use an AI image generator image in an article, using a disclosure such as, \"Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET via [Image generator name].\"\n\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"prompt\", \"access\", \"generate\", \"chatgpt\", \"image\", \"generators\", \"gemini\", \"midjourney\", \"free\", \"best\", \"images\", \"generator\", \"2025\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "2235aa1f28ade061d97ed1a363f8b8032828e6a0791906bb46c610551fe40c4e", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:11.208852+00:00"}

Whether you're new to AI chatbots or a regular user, this list should help you discover a fresh option you haven't tried before.\n\nWhat is the best AI chatbot right now?\n\nIn May 2024, OpenAI supercharged the free version of ChatGPT, solving its biggest pain points and lapping other AI chatbots on the market. For that reason, ChatGPT moved to the top of the list, making it the best AI chatbot available now. However, sometimes, like in the past week, ChatGPT servers can go down, and you may need a backup.\n\nAlso: I test AI tools for a living, and these are the only two worth paying for\n\nAlthough such outages are infrequent, having another chatbot in your back pocket is always a good idea.

An AI chatbot (also called an AI writer) is a type of AI-powered program capable of generating written content from a user's input prompt. AI chatbots can write anything from a rap song to an essay upon a user's request. The extent of what each chatbot can write about depends on its capabilities, including whether it is connected to a search engine. Show more\n\nHow do AI chatbots work? Chatbots use LLMs to train the AI to produce human-like responses. Some tools are connected to the web and that capability provides up-to-date information, while others depend solely on the information upon which they were trained. Show more\n\nHow much do AI chatbots cost? AI chatbot programs vary in cost. Some are entirely free, while others cost as much as $600 a month. However, many, like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and YouChat, are free to use. Show more\n\nWhat is the difference between an AI chatbot and an AI writer? The main difference between an AI chatbot and an AI writer is the type of output they generate and their primary function. In the past, an AI writer was used specifically to generate written content, such as articles, stories, or poetry, based on a given prompt or input. An AI writer outputs text that mimics human-like language and structure. On the other hand, an AI chatbot is designed to conduct real-time conversations with users in text or voice-based interactions. The primary function of an AI chatbot is to answer questions, provide recommendations, or even perform simple tasks, and its output is in the form of text-based conversations. While the terms AI chatbot and AI writer are now used interchangeably by some, the original distinction was that an AI writer was used for generating static written content, while an AI chatbot was used for conversational purposes. However, with the introduction of more advanced AI technology, such as ChatGPT, the line between the two has become increasingly blurred. Many AI chatbots are now capable of generating text-based responses that mimic human-like language and structure, similar to an AI writer.

{"url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/", "title": "The best phones to buy in 2025", "authors": "[\"Kerry Wan\", \"Managing Editor\", \"Allison Jewell\"]", "published": null, "text": "I've used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset. Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone right now:\n\nSpeeding up your smartphone\n\nSomething I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access, but rules were meant to be broken, right?\n\nTo turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From within, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from the 1x default setting to .5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.\n\nOptimizing your battery health\n\nTo preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn -- or degrade -- the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.\n\nWhen in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.\n\nHow to keep your phone clean\n\nUnless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Apple Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at one meter deep.\n\nOccasionally, take an alcohol pad and give your phone a wipe-down. If you think about it, your phone is just as likely to accumulate germs as your hands, so don't forget to clean it.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"developer\", \"water\", \"settings\", \"phone\", \"buy\", \"transition\", \"battery\", \"best\", \"charge\", \"phones\", \"options\", \"tap\", \"2025\"]", "content_hash": "7ef848956cbb1621c6cca3c806c9898afe071c5c0da9417286b0b4447976d33a", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:13.407638+00:00"}

With so many configurations and models available today, and the various software and feature implications that come with, the journey of choosing the right model has never been longer. For years, I've tested every iPhone released, including the large-sized iPhone 16 Pro Max and the budget-oriented iPhone 16e, gathering insights on what models resonate with what type of user.\n\nWith iOS 26 officially out in public beta, and the iPhone 17 series expected to launch in a matter of months, the dynamics of how you decide which iPhone model to buy and how you interact with it have just changed again. Notably, the latest software version will likely not be compatible with some older iPhones, including the iPhone XR and XS. So I'd advise against buying those two models, even if they can be had for less money. Instead, I'd consider your best options below.\n\nWhat is the best iPhone right now?\n\nZDNET's mobile experts carefully test every iPhone model at release, putting them through their paces to provide you with the best advice on which model to buy and the key features to look out for when you do. Right now, our pick for the best iPhone overall is the iPhone 16 Pro Max, thanks to its vivid and slim-bezel display, extensive camera tools, including a dedicated Camera Control button, and support for Apple Intelligence features. Should you prefer a smaller, easy-to-handle form factor, consider the iPhone 16 Pro.\n\nFor most people, the standard iPhone 16 is your best bet if you want the latest iOS 26 features and Camera Control but don't want to spend a thousand dollars. It helps that the base iPhone models this year sport colorful finishes that are sure to appeal.\n\nAlso: The best phones: Expert tested\n\nSort by All\n\nThe best iPhones of 2025\n\nShow less View now at Amazon View now at Apple The iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best iPhone overall due to its highly capable specifications and supersized attributes. It's the iPhone model that sets a new standard for Apple every year and continues to be a worthy competitor to Samsung's S Ultra series and Google's Pixel Pro XL. Why we like it: Besides being the largest iPhone Apple currently offers, with a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, the iPhone 16 Pro Max also has the best-rated battery life of 27 hours of video playback. From our tests, we found the phone lasted much longer than the standard 16 Pro and last year's 15 Pro Max. The iPhone 16 Pro Max looks and feels fairly similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as it's also made of titanium instead of the previous versions' stainless steel. This material choice \"makes the Pro phones about 10% lighter (than their predecessors) and is very durable,\" as ZDNET's editor-in-chief, Jason Hiner, describes it. The one notable hardware change comes in the form of a Camera Control key on the right side of the device. Camera Control lets you quickly turn on the camera app, adjust color tones and other photographic settings, and capture pictures and videos. It's a useful tool that, with a bit of practice, can be essential for creative workflows. Review: iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max Who it's for: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is a flagship phone that commands a flagship price, meaning it's ideal for users who are willing to pay for the best iPhone available, whether that's directly through retailers or through carrier deals. You should buy the Pro Max version if you want the larger screen, enduring battery life, and triple-camera setup. Who should look elsewhere: But if you're shopping on a budget and don't mind a smaller screen, consider the $999 iPhone 16 Pro ($200 cheaper and with a 6.1-inch display). If you can live without the dedicated telephoto lens, you can even go with the $899 iPhone 16 Plus, which features a large screen and battery, but only has wide and ultrawide lenses for shooting. iPhone 16 Pro Max specs: Processor: Apple A18 Pro Bionic | Display size: 6.8 inches with 120 Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB | Rear cameras: 48 MP wide, 48 MP ultra-wide, and 12 MP 5× telephoto | Front camera: 12 MP | Colors: Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium, White, Black | Weight: 227 g | Starting price: $1,099 Value 8 Performance 10 Battery life 9 Camera quality 9 Display 8 Pros Lightweight titanium shell\n\nCamera Control key for added utility\n\n48MP ultrawide with 4K 120fps recording\n\nA18 Pro processor capable of new AI features Cons Pricer than most flagship smartphones\n\nMay feel unwieldy for some users\n\nNo major hardware improvement over its predecessor iPhone 16 Pro Max Best iPhone overall 4.4 / 5 Score The iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best iPhone overall due to its highly capable specifications and supersized attributes. It's the iPhone model that sets a new standard for Apple every year and continues to be a worthy competitor to Samsung's S Ultra series and Google's Pixel Pro XL. Why we like it: Besides being the largest iPhone Apple currently offers, with a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, the iPhone 16 Pro Max also has the best-rated battery life of 27 hours of video playback. From our tests, we found the phone lasted much longer than the standard 16 Pro and last year's 15 Pro Max. The iPhone 16 Pro Max looks and feels fairly similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as it's also made of titanium instead of the previous versions' stainless steel. This material choice \"makes the Pro phones about 10% lighter (than their predecessors) and is very durable,\" as ZDNET's editor-in-chief, Jason Hiner, describes it. The one notable hardware change comes in the form of a Camera Control key on the right side of the device. Camera Control lets you quickly turn on the camera app, adjust color tones and other photographic settings, and capture pictures and videos. It's a useful tool that, with a bit of practice, can be essential for creative workflows. Review: iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max Who it's for: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is a flagship phone that commands a flagship price, meaning it's ideal for users who are willing to pay for the best iPhone available, whether that's directly through retailers or through carrier deals. You should buy the Pro Max version if you want the larger screen, enduring battery life, and triple-camera setup.

The answer depends on your needs and preferences. For example, while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is ZDNET's current pick for best phone of 2025, it may not be the best option for you if you often rely on services like iMessage and FaceTime, which are exclusive to Apple's operating systems. Previously, the gap between iPhones and Android phones was much larger due to Apple opting for a Lightning port instead of USB-C, but with the iPhone 15 models switching to the more universal port for charging and data transfer, it's become less intimidating to switch from Android to iPhone, and vice versa. Show more\n\nWhich iPhone model is right for you? It used to be fairly easy to choose an iPhone model as you typically opted for either the \"big\" iPhone or the \"small\" one. With four models available in the iPhone 16 series alone, you now have to dig a bit deeper to choose which is best for you. This is especially true of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, which feature nearly the same hardware, so check out our question above for more on this decision. Size is generally the first factor to consider, followed by price. Price limits will also drive the amount of internal storage you select for your iPhone. One fantastic aspect of the iPhone is that all models receive software support for years and years, so it's perfectly viable to buy an older model and trust that it will work well for you for quite some time. Choose this iPhone... If you want... Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max The top-of-the-line iPhone experience. Buy the Pro Max if you want the largest iPhone available without any of the compromises found on other models. This variant, along with the Pro, will also support Apple's existing (and upcoming) AI features. Apple iPhone 16 A reliable iPhone that now includes several Pro features. For most users, the standard iPhone 16 should be more than enough. Apple iPhone 16e The iPhone 16e is the cheapest model that Apple officially sells. You'll have to settle with a smaller, MagSafe-less design, but the performance makes up for it. Apple iPhone 13 Mini The only iPhone Mini that Apple makes. This is arguably the best compact smartphone money can buy, even if it's nearly three years old. Apple iPhone 15 An older iPhone that can handle modern-day tasks. The iPhone 15 is still a solid smartphone if you want the Apple experience for less, and it supports USB-C.

ZDNET's mobile experts also liaise with industry colleagues and analysts who have hands-on experience with the handsets, sifting through the iPhone pile for the best of the best. Here's the breakdown of what factors we look for. Display : Possibly the most overlooked feature on a smartphone, the display is what you stare at, scroll at, and interact with day in and day out. Therefore, when picking the best iPhones -- no matter the budget -- ZDNET puts an emphasis on devices with above-average panels. Ideally, a good display covers a wide color gamut, is durable, and has a high refresh rate for the smoothest visuals.\n\n: Possibly the most overlooked feature on a smartphone, the display is what you stare at, scroll at, and interact with day in and day out.

First, Apple just released the public beta of iOS 26, meaning general consumers can now test the upcoming software version ahead of its September (typical) release. iOS 26 introduces key changes to how apps and interfaces are visualized, due to the new Liquid Glass design language, as well as usability enhancements across popular services like Messages, Phone, CarPlay, and Photos. Of course, you'll need to use a compatible iPhone model to enroll in the public beta; anything from the iPhone 11 and onward should qualify. The second big news story concerns the iPhone 17 series, which is expected to launch in September in five different models: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Plus, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Air (or Slim). Recently, X user @Skyfops shared two images of what can be assumed to be an Apple employee handling a test-development iPhone in California. Also: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes While the product in question is encased in a security cover and privacy screen protector, the unique camera module on the back suggests that the person is holding an iPhone 17 Pro, with the LiDAR sensor and flash embedded on the right side of the device. The rumored horizontal camera bar, considered one of the more significant iPhone hardware changes in recent years, will be a welcome change. It suggests that Apple will give the upcoming iPhone models a noticeable upgrade in camera optics. (It also tells me that the iPhones will rock a little less when set on a table.) Show more\n\nHow do I take care of my new iPhone? There are several ways you can keep your iPhone clean and pristine. One way is by equipping a protective case and/or screen protector. The best iPhone cases offer reliable drop and scratch protection, won't bulk up the phone, and may feature some extra utility like a kickstand or MagSafe ring. As for screen protectors, tempered glass options are your best bet to keep the display underneath free of scratches and cracks. They're relatively affordable, too, often coming in multipacks for less than $10. Battery management is another key aspect of iPhone maintenance. To keep your device running for as long as possible, consider charging it between 20% to 80% battery. Overcharging the device would otherwise wear down the battery and reduce the health value (found in Settings). When your iPhone battery health is low (anything less than 75% typically is), it would be helpful to get it replaced at an Apple store or by an Apple-authorized technician. As stressful as it may be to clear up space to download that software update, you absolutely should. Besides fixing any bugs on your iPhone, software updates also bring with them security patches to reduce the chances of your phone getting hacked.

Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production. Smartphones are among the most affected by the new US tariffs, with devices imported from China and Vietnam facing steep duties that could raise retail prices by 20% or more. Brands like Apple and Google, which rely heavily on Asian manufacturing, may either pass these costs on to consumers or absorb them at the expense of profit margins. The tariffs could also lead to delays in product launches or shifts in where and how phones are made, forcing companies to diversify production to countries with more favorable trade conditions. Show more\n\nIs the $2,300 iPhone pricing legit? Some analysts have warned that companies such as Apple might pass these tariff costs onto buyers, potentially leading to significantly higher prices, with one estimate suggesting the iPhone 16 Pro Max could reach $2,300. Also: Worried about a $2,300 iPhone? How US tariffs are causing tech buyers to scramble In response, companies like Apple are reportedly exploring alternatives, such as increasing iPhone imports from India. Therefore, it's reasonable for consumers considering new tech purchases to potentially buy sooner to avoid these price hikes or to consider refurbished devices as a cost-saving measure. Show more\n\niPhone FAQs Will my iPhone support iOS 26? The next version of iPhone software is iOS 26, and it will be supported by the most recent models, including the iPhone 16 series, iPhone 15 series, and iPhone 14 series. Apple has confirmed that the now seven-year-old iPhone XS and XR models will not be eligible to be updated to iOS 26, as the company typically cuts off support after that time span. Show more What is the new iPhone? The newest iPhone is the iPhone 16e, which starts at $599, making it the company's most affordable handset in its storefront. For the price, you get a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display, Apple Intelligence support, an A18 chip, a single 48MP main camera on the rear, and a USB-C port for data transfer and charging. Show more Should I buy the iPhone 16 or wait for the iPhone 17? You should buy the iPhone 17 if... You want the best camera system on an iPhone\n\nYou can wait until September to learn more about what's new\n\nYou're interested in an ultra-slim iPhone that's lighter than normal handsets You should buy the iPhone 16 if... You require a new phone immediately; perhaps your existing handset broke or is unusable\n\nThere's a great deal on the older handset at your carrier or local retailer Show more Which iPhone is better, 15 or 16? Between the two latest generations of iPhones, here are the key reasons to buy one over the other: You should buy the iPhone 16 if... You want an iPhone that will last you for more than a day; the iPhone 16 Pro Max is great for this\n\nYou want access to the latest Apple Intelligence (AI) features and don't have a 15 Pro model You should buy the iPhone 15 if... You can find a good deal on a used, second-hand model Show more Lightning port vs. USB-C One of the biggest upgrades when Apple launched the iPhone 15 series was the USB-C port, a faster, more powerful, and more universal charging standard than the Lightning port on previous models. There's really no argument for the Lightning port unless you still own legacy Apple accessories, like the AirPods, and would much rather stick with the one charging standard. Also: Best USB-C chargers and accessories: Expert tested Otherwise, even if you own an iPad or MacBook, or almost any other non-Apple gadget, USB-C is more widely used and truly the one-size-fits-all option for charging and transferring data. Show more Which iPhone models support Apple's new AI features? Apple's existing (and upcoming) AI features, branded as \"Apple Intelligence,\" are available on iPhones with at least an A17 Pro processor. That means the iPhone 16 series and 15 Pro series will support the AI tools. Show more What storage size should I buy for my iPhone? It wasn't until 2021 that Apple began selling both its non-Pro and Pro iPhones with a base storage of 128GB. The only exception here is the iPhone SE model. While not as flashy of an upgrade as larger camera sensors and 120Hz displays, this double-up of storage meant that consumers had more space than ever to store apps, photos, videos, and more. Maurice Klaehne, senior market research analyst at Counterpoint Research, suggests that higher storage options are generally better as they will help with the longevity of the device, and his firm has generally seen an uptick in postpaid customers opting for higher storage sizes when they can afford them. \"Currently, the 256GB option is sufficient for most people,\" Klaehne adds. Show more Should I trade in my old iPhone? Trading in an old iPhone is one of the easiest (and safest) ways to replace an otherwise unwanted device with a new, more capable one. Most retailers, including Apple, accept trade-ins of older iPhone models, with store credit ranging from as low as $50 to $800; it all depends on which generation your iPhone is, the condition, and whether it turns on or not. Show more Is the iPhone 17 out yet? The iPhone 17 series is expected to launch in September 2025, with there being potentially four new models: the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The Air model is only rumored, but features a thinner design for better portability. Show more Do I really need an iPhone case? While an iPhone case is not a necessity -- your iPhone will still function normally without it -- having one on greatly reduces the chances of wear and tear. For example, the best cases are military-grade certified, meaning they'll keep your iPhone protected from waist-high drops. Not only do cases reduce the chances of your phone getting cracked or scratched, but the plastic/rubberized material often provides more grip than if you hold your iPhone naked. Show more Which iPhone should I buy for a parent? At the time of writing, the iPhone 16 is the best phone to buy for a parent. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as its Pro siblings, but the iPhone 16 model has all the essential features in 2025, from eSIM support to a reliable battery and charging experience to a display large enough for any form of content consumption. It also comes in a Plus size if you require a bigger screen size. From our testing, the cameras on the iPhone 16 are reliable enough for clear video calls, the occasional outdoor photo, and capturing images of children and pets. Show more What is eSIM? Embedded Subscriber Identity Module, or eSIM in short, is the electronic version of the classic SIM card. That means your eSIM carries your phone number, mobile data plan, and telephone carrier info, just like a regular SIM card. The major difference between eSIM and SIM is that the former does not need to be physically installed onto your phone, which is why the iPhone 14, 15, and 16 lines no longer have a dedicated slot for it. Instead, you'll have to transfer the information wirelessly via Apple's file transfer service, or with the help of your local carrier representatives. Also: eSIM vs. SIM: What's the difference? There is one problem that ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner sees with Apple forcing eSIM adoption on US consumers. \"There are a variety of good reasons why some people will still need or prefer a phone with a physical SIM card. The top reason is privacy. This is especially true for some journalists and populations at risk of persecution around the world. Removing the physical SIM card option reduces privacy for millions of people, especially some of the most vulnerable,\" said Hiner. Note that if you buy an iPhone 14, 15, or 16 anywhere outside of the U.S., the device will come with a regular SIM card slot. Show more Which iPhone models support 5G? All models within the iPhone 16, 15, 14, and 13 line, as well as select iPhone 12 models, support 5G wireless technology. Even the new iPhone 16e supports Sub-6, low-band 5G networks. 5G continues to roll out across the US, and while it is debatable if there are benefits to the speeds of the network, in my experience, the broad coverage of low-band 5G has solved my connectivity issues in spotty coverage areas with past iPhone models. Even more importantly, the 5G iPhone models have Qualcomm chipsets inside that are proving to provide better RF reception than we saw in past iPhones that had Intel chipsets. Show more Which iPhone models support wireless charging or MagSafe? All of the iPhone models in this list support Qi wireless charging technology, which is becoming an expected feature for modern smartphones from all manufacturers. Meanwhile, Apple's proprietary MagSafe technology is only supported by the iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12 models. (Notably, the latest iPhone 16e does not support MagSafe.) Also: Best MagSafe accessories for your iPhone MagSafe provides a secure magnetic connection system so that you can connect to wireless chargers with perfect positioning and alignment. MagSafe can also be used with other accessories, such as wallets and kickstands. While the extra security when your iPhone is docked to a wireless charger can be a nice bonus, it's not vital and probably shouldn't be a major determiner in your choice. Apple's first-party wallets and battery packs that use MagSafe have also received somewhat mixed reviews, making them a hard sell for all except the most die-hard Apple enthusiasts. Show more How many years do iPhones typically last? While this number varies greatly depending on how you handle a smartphone -- perhaps you're a construction worker whose phone will be put through the harshest climates or you have kids who may drop the phone ever so often -- the iPhone will typically run efficiently for three to four years. Then, you'll likely experience more frequent app crashes, lag, storage problems, and more. Those are common issues that any piece of technology will inhibit, not just the iPhone, after years of constant usage. If you'd like to prolong that time, I'd recommend visiting your local Apple store to have the phone's battery replaced every three to four years and also consider backing up files to an external hard drive for safekeeping. As a last resort, a factory reset, followed by data restoration, should give your phone a brand-new feel.

When our phones need a battery boost, most of us can't stay tethered to a wall outlet. Thankfully, with MagSafe battery packs, you don't have to. The battery market is packed with options that can boost your phone's battery life on the go.\n\nFrom portable power banks to wireless charging stations, there's something for everyone. I've personally tested over a dozen MagSafe battery packs from brands like Torras and Baseus, evaluating factors like design, function, and value. I've also selectively incorporated other picks based on ZDNET expert reviews and evaluations.\n\nWhat's the best MagSafe battery pack right now?\n\nRight now, our pick for the best overall MagSafe battery pack is the Baseus PicoGo Magnetic power bank due to its practical design, function, and affordability. Should you prefer a slimmer yet comparable pack, the Torras MiniMag is a personal favorite. In addition, the Zendure Supermini Q or ESR Qi2 10,000mAh battery packs are great options for those who need more power on the go.\n\nI, and other ZDNET experts, went hands-on with several of the top MagSafe battery packs, including every pick on this list.

Why we like it: It can charge at 20W with wired charging or at 15W with wireless, magnetic charging. Plus, it can simultaneously charge wirelessly and with the USB-C port for a double device boost. When I tested this pack, it increased the battery of my iPhone 14 Pro from 25% to 60% in 30 minutes. About 40 minutes later, the phone was back up to 80%, with half of the battery capacity still left in the pack. It's priced at only $50.

ZDNET went hands-on with all of the MagSafe battery packs on this list. We affixed these packs to our own smartphones during our daily lives to test out recharge rate, magnetic strength, pass-through capabilities, comfort, and more. We used them over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for a product's add-in value. That is, can you \"add-in\" this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that's too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? If we think another product is worth your money, we'll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for. Plus, we are routinely scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, and following news on product rollouts and upgrades, and sourcing the best deals.

Imports from some countries may decrease in availability and increase in cost more than others. It may be time to take note of products you were looking to buy in the next few months and accelerate your purchasing timeline.\n\nSmall tech accessories like chargers, cables, adapters, and MagSafe gear will not necessarily be immune to the current economic times. Many accessories utilize imported metals and materials. However, accessories like MagSafe gear will likely still remain \"affordable\" in comparison to larger tech products like laptops and iPhones that are more likely to see bigger cost increases.\n\nRight now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.\n\nAlso: Tariff exemptions for electronics offer a break for tech - but not for long\n\nLatest updates\n\nOther MagSafe battery packs we've tested\n\n\n\n\n\nZDNET Recommends\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"2025\", \"boost\", \"pack\", \"power\", \"capacity\", \"looking\", \"battery\", \"best\", \"tested\", \"options\", \"charging\", \"wireless\", \"magsafe\", \"bank\", \"phones\", \"magnetic\", \"packs\"]", "content_hash": "5381cd251ed35e52a91688194ff3e9b3e432c5e46f4ddcf6fa96e284200f7e51", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:15.695751+00:00"}

For example, lightweight laptops are made to be carried around, and trade in some raw power for portability. 2-in-1 laptops come with touchscreens that allow for use as a tablet. The best form factor for you reflects how you think you'll use the device.\n\nLightweight/ultraportable laptops\n\nMade for students, hybrid workers, and anyone who needs to commute with their laptop. These devices have seen a huge explosion in the past few years, becoming thinner and lighter than ever. Some good examples are the Asus Zenbook A14, the Apple MacBook Air M4, and the Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition -- all devices we've tested and love for their ultraportable forms relative to power and battery life.\n\nBusiness laptops\n\nDesigned for the office, these laptops often come with more RAM and local storage, but less powerful GPUs. Their physical designs are often sleek, neutral, and corporate, and they feature lots of ports for compatibility purposes. Premium work laptops may have extra touches like OLED screens (like the HP EliteBook X G1a) or haptic trackpads (Lenovo's ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition) to match the high-end hardware.\n\n2-in-1 laptops\n\nAlso called convertibles, these laptops allow for the screen to be folded all the way back so it can act as a tablet or be used in \"tent mode\" to display media. Some 2-in-1 laptops we're big fans of are the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16 and the Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1.\n\nGaming Laptops\n\nAs the name suggests, these are laptops made to run games, and as such come with the hardware to support that. We're talking high-end GPUs, large, vivid displays, and often, RGB lighting and other physical design effects that set them apart from business laptops.\n\nWhile they're designed to run the latest titles, they also can double as good machines for creatives thanks to their high-end hardware, and as such, tend to be pricier. Some gaming laptops we love are the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i and the Alienware Area-51m 18.\n\nMacBooks\n\nApple's line of MacBooks are premium devices with a host of features that integrate into the Apple ecosystem. The hardware on MacBooks is arguably some of the best in the industry, with things like gorgeous Liquid Retina displays, crisp, clear webcams, and Apple's line of Silicon processors, which have some of the most impressive performance on the market. The trade-off is the cost, which start around the $1,000 mark and go upwards from there.\n\nChromebooks\n\nGoogle's Chromebook lineup uses its own operating system -- ChromeOS -- to power its lineup of light and affordable laptops. Putting a streamlined, limited OS onto a laptop with modest hardware means you forgo the sprawling memory demands of Windows, and run 8GB of RAM smoothly and efficiently.\n\nWe're big fans of Chromebooks at ZDNET, with some of our favorites being the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and the Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"chromebook\", \"plus\", \"come\", \"ive\", \"highend\", \"ones\", \"power\", \"lenovo\", \"tested\", \"best\", \"run\", \"dozens\", \"hardware\", \"2025\", \"devices\", \"laptops\"]", "content_hash": "b0ca6ec05d670217e8b3f1f7e53cea68daf1b5f24be31e1631d5ede1415e1fe8", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:17.710695+00:00"}

Tablets sit in the middle of smartphones and laptops. They are a compromisable device that allows for a bigger screen than a smartphone for tasks like editing PDFs, streaming movies, or browsing websites, but smaller and more portable than a laptop for note-taking, sketching and drawing, or photo editing. Plus, now many tablets have accessories like styli and keyboards that allow you to use it as a sort of laptop replacement if you're doing relatively easy work on it.

The biggest question you'll need to answer about any tablet purchase is what you plan on using it for: Do you just want something to read a comic book and binge on some Netflix shows while you walk on the treadmill? If so, then a Fire tablet or the base model iPad is going to be more than enough for you. However, if you want to use a tablet more like a laptop, then you'll want to consider the iPad Pro, or one of the Surface devices. Here is a decision matrix that can help you choose which tablet is right for you: Choose this tablet... If you want or are... Apple iPad (11th-gen) The best overall option when it comes to power, storage, and user-friendliness. The Apple iPad is the best tablet for anything.

When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best. Display : We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy. We also compare the display's performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen's responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer's stylus.\n\n: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy. Performance: For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet's temperature during intensive tasks.\n\nBattery life: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games. Camera and audio: For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion. For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive tablet testing methodology. Show more\n\nWhat are the different tablet sizes? Tablets range in size from small to large. Small tablets are usually five to seven inches. Mid-size tablets have a screen ranging from nine to 11 inches. Then, there are large tablets with screen sizes from 12-14 inches. Keep in mind that the larger the tablet, the heavier it will usually be. Show more\n\nLatest news on tablets\n\nDespite tariff concerns, 2025 is shaping up to be a big year for tablets. Already, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultra, Apple iPad, Apple iPad Air, and the OnePlus Pad 3 have debuted on the market as new models. In addition, Apple is set to debut its new iPad Pro with an M5 chip at some point, most likely during its September event.\n\nAlso on the Apple front, iPadOS 19 is expected to also be released this fall, and we're expecting a better multitasking mode for better productivity on iPads.\n\nFAQs on tablets What does it mean if a tablet is Wi-Fi only? When a tablet says it is \"Wi-Fi Only,\" it requires a wireless internet connection to access things like email, websites, and apps. There are models available that give you the option to use LTE cellular data to connect to the internet, but if you aren't planning on traveling with your tablet, you can stick to a Wi-Fi only model. Show more Can tablets replace a laptop? That depends on what you want to use your tablet or laptop for. Digital artists tend to prefer tablets since they're easier to draw on with a stylus. Tablets are also great for photo editing and streaming movies if you get one with a large enough screen size. But if you want to do things like create spreadsheets, type in a word processing program, or do intensive 3D animation or modeling, you're better off with a laptop.

This watch integrates several Fitbit features, including improved heart rate sensors and GPS tracking, making it secretly the best watch available for both Fitbit and Google Pixel fans.\n\nWho it's for: Google incorporated a running workout builder that gathers your health data over a two-week period and then creates a program that adapts to your data regularly. Real-time guidance is provided as you run, advanced metrics are tracked and then Google shows you how to improve the metrics, a Daily Readiness Score is provided even if you are not a Fitbit Premium subscriber, and Cardio/Target load features are available. The Cardio and Target load features may even trump some of the best sports watches.\n\nBottom line: If you're a Fitbit fan and are looking for the latest and greatest Fitbit in a watch form factor, then the Google Pixel Watch 3 is the wearable for you. If you also enjoy Google's take on wearables and want years of updates, then this is the watch to consider.\n\nOne of the best functions of the Pixel Watch 3 that even beats out the Apple Watch is the focus on safety. While the Apple Watch can appear in your Find My application, and you can share your location with family and friends, that's a passive setting that requires people to physically check the app to find you. The Pixel 3's Safety Check feature allows you to set a check-in timer whenever you're moving from point A to B and want your emergency contacts to be notified if anything goes wrong -- the most reliable feature I've seen on any wearable I've tested. It also supports immediate emergency alerts/SOS and fall detection alerts, similar to the latest Apple Watches.\n\nThe new Loss of Pulse Detection feature is available for US owners. This feature has the potential to save lives and I look forward to hearing of success stories soon since my own father could have possibly been saved by this feature.\n\nReview: Hands-on with the Pixel Watch 3: The three features Google got right\n\nWho should look elsewhere: If you use an iPhone, don't even think about the Pixel Watch 3. Google WearOS watches used to work with iOS, but that is no longer the case so you need an Android phone to use this watch.

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Olemedia/iStock/Getty Images Plus via Getty Images\n\nZDNET's key takeaways\n\nCisco's Secure Firewall Management Center security hole is as bad as they get.\n\nThere is no mitigation and no workaround. Patch immediately.\n\nSo far, no confirmed active exploits have been confirmed.\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nDo you use Cisco's Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) software? If your company operates a serious network using Cisco products -- and with Cisco's 76%+ market share of high-end networking, chances are that you do -- you must patch it. Not over the weekend. Not Monday. Right now.\n\nAlso: Microsoft patches more than 100 Windows security flaws - update your PC now\n\nCisco has just patched a critical command injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-20265) in FMC. How critical is critical? Let's put it this way: It has a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 10.0, which is the highest possible risk rating in vulnerability scoring. Specifically, the flaw affects FMC versions 7.0.7 and 7.7.0 that have been configured for RADIUS authentication on the web-based or SSH management interface.\n\nRADIUS is the de facto standard for network authentication. It's the most common implementation used to enable 802.1X access control management. In other words, if you use FMC, it's almost a certainty you're using RADIUS, which means you're vulnerable.\n\nThe problem is that because the software didn't sanitize user input in the RADIUS authentication phase, attackers can send crafted credentials that will be executed as high-privileged shell commands. If abused correctly, this can grant anyone full control over the firewall management center.\n\nAlso: This infamous people search site is back after leaking 3 billion records - how to remove your data from it ASAP\n\nAdding insult to injury, attackers can exploit the flaw without any prior system access or valid credentials. I repeat: without any prior system access or valid credentials.\n\nThis is a security nightmare. Once a hacker has complete control over firewall management, they can do pretty much anything they want to both the firewall and the rest of your network.\n\nThe one bit of good news is that Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software are not affected.\n\nOh, and by the way, Cisco states, \"There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\" You must patch the program. Now.\n\nCisco reports that there have been no confirmed active exploits in the wild so far. Give it time. The information in the security report is more than enough for a clever hacker to figure out how to exploit this security hole.\n\nSo, once more and with feeling, patch it. Patch it now.\n\nAlso: Don't fall for AI-powered disinformation attacks online - here's how to stay sharp\n\nCisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels. However, given how deep this hole goes, Cisco is also offering the patch for free. In either case, take the following steps:\n\nGo to the official Cisco Security Advisory for CVE-2025-20265. Log in with your Cisco account linked to your organization's support contract. Use the Cisco Software Checker tool or check the Download section of the advisory to identify the specific fixed release for your appliance/version. Download and install the FMC software update for your deployment -- patched versions for 7.0.7 and 7.7.0 are provided.\n\nYou know what to do now.

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nI admit it: I'm addicted to multitools. My daily carry for the past year or so has been the Gerber Dual Force, which has the most powerful pliers and best screwdriver on a multitool I've used. But the Dual Force is big and heavy, and not suited for lightweight applications like hiking.\n\nAlso: 10 tiny tools I carry with me everywhere - how they work\n\nI have some hikes on the horizon where I'll want a flexible multitool that can handle things like bottle opening, tightening up the odd screw, and cutting and fixing things. In my search for such a compact, lightweight multitool with a decent selection of tools, I came across the NexTool S11 Pro.\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nPutting aside the name, which makes it sound like a smartphone, the S11 Pro is marketed as a 12-in-1 EDC (everyday carry) multitool aimed at the hiker and camper.\n\nTiny but very effective bottle opener. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nIt measures a compact 1.97 x 0.63 x 4.12-inches and it weighs a miniscule 2.9 oz. This is a lot smaller and lighter than my Dual Force, which weighs a tiresome 12 ounces.\n\nThe NexTool S11 Pro is a lot smaller than the Gerber Dual Force. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nIt's also packed with features I rely on when out and about. The pliers are a good compromise of size and performance, the blade is sharp enough for most tasks and holds an edge well, and the screwdrivers and scissors are well designed and do their job well.\n\nIt also has a few more specialist tools, like a SIM tray eject tool (which is useful for a lot more things than ejecting SIM trays), and even some neat glow in the dark inserts that make finding the multitool at the bottom of a rucksack or in the undergrowth you've dropped it into, a whole lot easier.\n\nI do like a bit of glow in the dark! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nThe tools are also tough, with NexTool having upgraded to 8Cr14Mov stainless steel for the knife blade, a metal that has decent hardness and wear resistance and corrosion resistance, while the scissors, screwdrivers, bottle opener and pliers use 5Cr15Mov, a more general use steel that balanced toughness and corrosion-resistance.\n\nThese materials are ideal for a tool that's going to get exposed to rain, salt spray, and sweat, and is going to be asked to handle whatever tasks need handling, from tightening up a screw, to being used like a caveman's hammer.\n\nAnything can be a hammer if you try hard enough. This is how you safely hold a multitool like a hammer. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nAlso: The TSA-approved multitool myth: I tested it on a plane so you don't have to\n\nDo remember when traveling that this multitool does have a blade on it, and that this can run foul of authorities in some places (think airports everywhere, and places like train stations in Europe). If you want something that's more travel-friendly, I recommend the NexTool Mini Sailor Lite.\n\nThe blade is handy, but it makes the NexTool S11 Pro airport unfriendly. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nWhy I recommend this product\n\nNexTool has been seriously impressing me lately. As someone who used to be a fanboy of expensive multitools, this company proves that a decent quality tool doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. Sure, there are always compromises, and you don't get 25-year warranties like you get with a Leatherman, but with the NexTool S11 Pro you're buying a tool that costs $30, and for that you still get a very generous 10-year warranty.\n\nFor me, this is the perfect tool if I'm trying to keep carry weight to a minimum. I get a set of tools that will handle the basics, without carrying a heavy lump of metal with me on the trail.\n\nLooking for the next best product?

View now at Best Buy\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nNo, you're not seeing double. This is the second review I've done for Lenovo's Legion Go S. However, this one is special because it doesn't run Windows 11 -- it runs SteamOS. That single change in the operating system elevates the Legion Go S from a \"just okay\" gaming handheld to a great one -- rivaling the Steam Deck itself.\n\nBefore I break down the handheld, I should explain Steam OS to those who don't know, as the software is at the center of what makes this new model so good.\n\nAlso: I replaced my work PC with this Dell laptop, and it was one of my best decisions\n\nSteamOS is a lightweight operating system originally exclusive to the Steam Deck. It delivers a user-friendly interface that isn't bloated with unwanted apps, and more importantly, it's designed specifically for gaming.\n\nIt's this streamlined OS is a big reason why the Steam Deck has been so popular -- it's no fuss, no muss. Back in January, Valve (the developer of Steam) announced it would begin licensing the operating system to third-party companies, with Lenovo being the first (and at the time of this writing, only) partner.\n\nA familiar design\n\nDesign-wise, it's identical to the earlier model with the only discernable difference being the color. It is now in Nebula purple instead of Glacier White. The device itself is just as comfortable in my hands and doesn't feel bulky. Textured grips on the side stop slipping, hall-effect analog sticks maintain accuracy and prevent drifting, and the switches on the back affect the travel distance for the rear triggers.\n\nAlso: This MSI handheld could replace my gaming laptop, and not just for its more portable design\n\nHowever, the touchpad under the right analog stick has lost its purpose. In the previous model, it was used to control the cursor for various purposes, like navigating a web browser. But, this device doesn't support any browser or apps for that matter -- it's just Steam.\n\nThe touchpad can be used in games as another button or to help aim weapons, although performing the latter doesn't feel great. It's so small that it's difficult to get precise movements. Most of the time, I ended up aiming my character in a completely different direction when I meant to shoot the enemy in front of me.\n\nCesar Cadenas/ZDNET\n\nGaming on the go\n\nYour gaming experience on the Legion Go S depends on the titles you play. As cool as this handheld may be, it is still just a handheld, not some ultra-powerful desktop. Underneath the hood is an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor, an AMD Radeon GPU, and 16GB of RAM. This configuration is much happier tackling lightweight games like \"Hades\" or \"Stardew Valley\". Titles like those run at a consistently smooth 120Hz. It's like art.\n\nAAA games like Monster Hunter Wilds have a harder time running on the Legion Go S. Graphics are blurry, and performance slows down when there's a lot on screen. That sounds like a knock against the device, but the Steam Deck also struggles with the same. It's the nature of the tech, and the fact that it can even run these titles at all is commendable in its own right.\n\nLuckily, you can tweak the hardware's performance on the fly. Pressing the button at the upper right corner of the screen launches the settings menu. Then, just click the lightning bolt icon to open the Performance page where you can tweak the game's performance to best suit your needs.\n\nIf you don't want to spend half an hour adjusting the settings like I did, you can just activate a title's default profile. This feature is my absolute favorite. It automatically applies a game's performance profile according to what Steam has for it, taking all of the guesswork out.\n\nCesar Cadenas/ZDNET\n\nBattery life isn't great. While \"Monster Hunter\", the Legion Go S ran for about an hour and 15 minutes before I had to grab the charger. However, on lighter games like \"Hades 2\", that time went up to two hours.\n\nLenovo Legion Go S vs Steam Deck\n\nWith the release of the SteamOS Legion Go S, I consider the previous Windows model obsolete. This version is the only one you should care about, and it serves as a great alternative to the OLED Steam Deck. Now the question is, what should you get: the Legion Go S or the Steam Deck?\n\nCesar Cadenas/ZDNET\n\nIt's close, but I like the Legion Go S more because of its touchscreen. Lenovo's device has an 8-inch LCD that runs at a 120Hz refresh rate, while Valve's Steam Deck has a 7.4-inch OLED touchscreen that runs at 90Hz max. I value higher refresh rates because they ensure smoother animations and faster response times, which can mean the difference between winning and losing.\n\nOn the other hand, the Steam Deck's OLED screen does mean its color output is more impressive.\n\nAlso: I replaced my ThinkPad with a dual-screen Windows laptop - here's my verdict after a month\n\nThere are other deciding factors to consider. The Steam Deck's OLED display delivers a more vibrant color palette, and Valve's device is lighter at 1.4 pounds, while the Legion Go S clocks in at 1.62 pounds. Also, the Steam Deck has significantly larger touchpads underneath the Deck's analog sticks, which make controlling first-person shooters easier.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nLenovo's Legion Go S is on sale for $600 at Best Buy right now, which is a competitive price. I had a blast with this product, and it's a device I would absolutely get for myself, especially on sale. However, if you value more vibrant colors and bigger trackpads, get the Steam Deck, which retails for $549.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"day\", \"night\", \"steam\", \"deck\", \"legion\", \"steamos\", \"handheld\", \"model\", \"retested\", \"difference\", \"device\", \"games\", \"s\", \"lenovos\", \"pc\", \"windows\", \"performance\"]", "content_hash": "35268b85bc8cd05d496437d856a09024b42d9da8c7fea0b7dc8641ed5313ae46", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:25.064048+00:00"}

As part of that reorganization, I picked up a KeySmart Air key organizer as a way to both keep my keys sorted and also attach an AirTag to them.\n\nAlso: 10 tiny tools I carry with me everywhere - how they work\n\nSo, here we are, almost three years on, and I'm still using the KeySmart Air, and while it's looking a little battered, it's still going strong.\n\nThe KeySmart Air comes in three versions -- faux leather, leather, and a polymer variant called Flex (I'm sure only the leather and faux leather were available when I bought mine -- and I went for the faux SmartShield leather version because KeySmart said it had a \"rugged leather feel\" yet lasted \"10x longer than traditional leather.\" That sounded good to me.\n\nAlso: My new favorite keychain holder can carry up to 14 keys (and is trackable by phone)\n\nThe idea behind the KeySmart Air is simple -- it's a loop of material where the keys fit onto a screw fastener, and the AirTag fits into a molded loop. Fitting your keys into the holder is quite easy: All you need is a flat-headed screwdriver (or a thin coin).\n\nSimple, but it's super effective.\n\nWhat I like about the KeySmart line is that they make a ton of cool accessory tools that fit into the Air or their other key organizers, such as a mini knife (not TSA friendly, so be aware of that), a tiny 5-in-1 multitool, a magnetic breakaway connector, and a range of other small but useful multitools. I have quite a few of these accessories; they're all good quality and worth the money.\n\nSo, how has the KeySmart Air held up to almost three years of use?\n\nNot bad for close to three years of use. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nVery well. Sure, it looks rougher than when I got it out of the box, but it's still perfectly functional and serviceable. The material is still perfectly intact, and the screw fastener that holds the keys is like new. And for $30, I can't complain.\n\nAlso: I never leave home without this viral USB-C key ring accessory\n\nOne modification that I did to my KeySmart Air was to replace the supplied metal split ring with a KeyUnity titanium D-ring shackle because that was both more convenient and a more robust choice for my setup. It was an easy upgrade to personalize an already valuable tool for my lifestyle.\n\nThe KeyUnity titanium D-ring shackle is a good upgrade on the supplied split ring. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nWhy I recommend this product\n\nThings that are part of my EDC get quite a hard life, and when I picked up the KeySmart Air I was curious to see how well it would hold up. And now several years on, I'm happy to report that it's been fantastic. It's securely held my keys, tools, and AirTag, and has lasted through daily use without a hitch.\n\nIt's one of the nicest AirTag holders I've used, far nicer and more compact than the pendant-style holders. I'm not a fan of the silicone AirTag holders because I've had some where the tag has fallen out. There's no chance of that with the KeySmart Air.\n\nThe faux leather has held up surprisingly well, but I am curious how well the genuine leather and polymer would hold up. I might get some to test!\n\nLooking for the next best product?

The consequences of that data falling into the wrong hands can range from embarrassing to damaging to potentially opening up you or your company to legal headaches.\n\nBut encrypting data on external drives can also be a pain. If you have to run separate applications, things quickly become a big hassle, and that's how data gets left unencrypted.\n\nAlso: 10 tiny tools I carry with me everywhere - and how they work\n\nBut what if there was a way of easily encrypting and decrypting data without messing with any applications? Well, there is, and I guarantee you that you'll feel like James Bond every time you use the Kingston IronKey.\n\nThe SSD looks like any regular SSD, except it has a screen. It's a touchscreen, and you use this to input your passcode and change the drive settings.\n\nAlso: My new favorite keychain holder can carry up to 14 keys (and is trackable by phone)\n\nThis drive is one of the easiest and most convenient ways to encrypt data when moving. The initial setup for this drive took seconds -- I had to input my secret passcode -- and it was ready to use.\n\nAnd use it I have.\n\nThis drive has been with me in a handful of countries across three continents and all across the UK, and it's going strong.\n\nAnd while this drive is very good at securing data thanks to the XTS-AES 256-bit hardware encryption, it does a lot more than that. For example, it has a randomized on-screen keyboard (so finger smudges don't give away your passcode), a read-only mode to prevent data (or malware) from being written to the drive, and an automatic timeout in case you forget to eject the drive.\n\nWhy I recommend this product\n\nThere's a lot that I like about the Kingston IronKey Vault Privacy 80 SSD. It's also available in four capacities, so you're only buying the amount you need. Mine was the 960GB version, which is fine for me, but if you're a data hog, you can get one that is 7.6TB (that'll set you back a cool $965).\n\nI also like how intuitive this drive is to use. Everything you need to know is on the touchscreen, so you don't have to decipher what some combination of blinking lights means. A screen makes all the difference, and making it a touchscreen makes it convenient and familiar to use.\n\nI've tried a lot of different encrypted drives, but I keep returning to this one.

Notable Apple insider Ming-Chi Kuo supported the rumors in a post on X in July, claiming the company was currently working on a \"more-affordable MacBook\" running on the A18 Pro chipset -- the same one found in the iPhone 16 Pro -- instead of an M-series processor.\n\nAlso: 5 Apple products you definitely shouldn't buy this month (and 7 to get instead)\n\nTech news site DigiTimes claims to have recently spoken to an insider with intimate knowledge of this laptop, suggesting the device will cost somewhere between $599 and $699: much cheaper than the M4 MacBook Air's starting price of $999.\n\nEven more notable is the alleged timing of such a product: releasing this fall, just as millions of PC users are looking for a new computer when Microsoft pulls the plug on support for Windows 10.\n\n(Even more) lightweight\n\nThe MacBook Air M4 Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nDigiTimes reports this new MacBook will sport a 12.9-inch display, slightly smaller than the MacBook Air's 13-inch screen. What's interesting is that this size closely correlates with what Kuo said a month ago.\n\nIn fact, much of the information told to DigiTimes lines up with Kuo wrote. According to the report, components may enter \"mass production\" by the end of Q3 2025 (sometime in September). Then, the laptop will become \"commercially available\" by either late 2025 or early 2026, which, as MacRumors points out, is \"similar to [Ming Chi Kuo's] launch estimation.\"\n\nAlso: Apple's improved Siri voice assistant may finally have a release date - and I'm ready to ditch Gemini for it\n\nDetails, however, remain scarce. There's much we don't know, but it is worth mentioning that the future MacBook is rumored to launch in a variety of colors, including Pink, Blue, Silver, and Yellow, breaking the mold of what MacBooks look like.\n\nPerfect timing\n\nWindows 10 support officially ends on October 14, 2025 as Microsoft aims to push users to Windows 11. If this laptop hits the market in November or December, not only would it be in the middle of the holiday season, but may also prove totally irresistible to Windows 10 users looking for a new device without all the bloat or unnecessary features. That said, it probably won't be a perfect device.\n\nMacRumors mentions the fact \"that the A19 pro chip lacks Thunderbolt support\", meaning the future MacBook could only have regular USB-C ports. Thunderbolt ports have unique features like the ability to send out video signals to multiple monitors simulateanously and lightning-fast data trasnfer speeds.\n\nThat could be a dealbreaker for some, but the advent of a low-cost MacBook cheaper than the Air may be too alluring to ignore.\n\nThe laptop isn't the only rumored project. Kuo also claimed that Apple is working on a pair of smart glasses set to release in 2027. This pair will reportedly function similarly to Meta Ray-Bans, as it won't have a heads up display. However, he suggested the glasses will provide audio playback, record video, and support \"AI environmental sensing\", with multiple material and style options.\n\nLooking for the next best product?

Why GPT-5 emboldens the doomsayers\n\n\"It's the highest number of hyper-growth startups we have ever seen.\"\n\nAI supernovas and shooting stars\n\nThe firm, which has spent $1 billion on startups so far to fulfill a plan announced two years ago, categorizes startups into three classes according to their speed to revenue: supernovas, shooting stars, and cloud centaur. Supernovas are companies that have reached, on average, $40 million in annual revenue after one year in business.\n\nAlso: Don't fall for AI-powered disinformation attacks online - here's how to stay sharp\n\nThe Bessemer team does not cite any revenue data for individual companies. According to an AI model run by FactSet Systems, four-year-old Anthropic is estimated to have $53 million in annual revenue. According to the same model, Perplexity, founded in 2022, may be generating $10 million a year. Canva's last disclosed revenue count was for $1.7 billion in 2022, according to FactSet. The company was founded in 2012.\n\nBessemer has a long track record of backing some of the most successful tech firms, including Twilio, LinkedIn, Yelp, Pinterest, and Wix. (See the full list here.)\n\nBessemer Venture Partners\n\nAI state of play\n\nThe report summarizes AI into five categories: infrastructure, development tools, enterprise AI, vertical-market AI, and consumer AI.\n\nThe big platforms, provided by OpenAI, Google, and other giants, mean that \"a new infrastructure layer has emerged --spanning models, compute, training frameworks, orchestration, and observability,\" they write.\n\nAlso: Why GPT-5's rocky rollout is the reality check we needed on superintelligence hype\n\nBut a \"second act\" is unfolding, they argue, wherein the AI giants move beyond benchmark tests to \"building systems that define, measure, and solve problems with experience, clarity, and purpose,\" including establishing the connections from AI models to systems for \"knowledge retrieval, memory, planning, and inference optimization.\"\n\nIn the dev tools market, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) created by Anthropic is establishing itself as an industry standard, a kind of USB-C to hook things together in AI.\n\n\"For developers, MCP radically simplifies integration. For founders, it opens the door to building truly agentic products -- where AI doesn't just assist users, but acts on their behalf across systems,\" they write.\n\nAn important element going forward will be how tools incorporate memory and storage, moving beyond early efforts such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Bennett and team relate that \"While the foundational model companies are working on memory, so too are startups like mem0, Zep, SuperMemory, and LangMem by Langchain.\"\n\nAlso: RAG can make AI models riskier and less reliable, new research shows\n\nIn enterprise AI, traditional \"system-of-record\" software such as Salesforce is under attack because AI can make it easier to move away from that software by lowering switching costs, the authors argue.\n\n\"For decades, SoRs like Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, and ServiceNow held firm thanks to their deep product surfaces, implementation complexity, and centrality to business-critical data. \"With AI's ability to structure unstructured data and generate code on demand, migrating to a new system is faster, cheaper, and more feasible than ever.\"\n\nThat observation is especially interesting given how much concern there is nowadays that AI may replace traditional commercial software.\n\nFor vertical markets, AI will succeed where broad-based software failed to capture the complexity of individual industries and practices.\n\nAlso: This is the fastest local AI I've tried, and it's not even close - how to get it\n\n\"SaaS failed to solve high-value vertical-specific tasks that were multi-modal or language heavy,\" they write. \"Vertical AI is finally meeting these users where they are, with products that feel less like software and more like real leverage.\"\n\nThe authors believe the payoff from AI's vertical market expertise is strong for buyers. \"ROI is clear from day one and there's no Excel spreadsheet needed to explain it to the user,\" they write. \"These tools unlock 10x productivity, reallocate labor to higher-value work, reduce costs, or drive topline growth. The value is immediate, not a \"nice to have.\"\n\nAs far as consumer AI, the average consumer up to this point has been exploring \"the novelty and utility of AI,\" and engaging in some limited productivity activities with AI's help, \"such as writing, editing and searching.\"\n\nAs the interactions have become habitual for consumers, new modes of interaction are emerging beyond simply chatting with a bot. \"Platforms like Vapi in the Voice AI space are helping power consumers' abilities to interact with machines in a way that spans language, context, and emotion,\" they note.\n\nAlso: How AI-enabled autonomous business will change the way you work forever\n\nAnd Perplexity \"has emerged as a breakout darling,\" leading \"one of the most meaningful shifts is in how consumers search for information and interact with the web altogether.\"\n\nEmerging successes are focused on specific use cases for the consumer, they write. \"This includes AI journals and mentors like Rosebud and gamified self-care companions like Finch.\"\n\nThey note some areas that are ripe for opportunity between the large AI platforms and startups. Two include travel booking and shopping. Travel is \"fragmented and time-consuming\" today, they observe. \"The opportunity for a personalized, end-to-end travel concierge is enormous, but still unclaimed.\"\n\nAnd shopping can be \"fundamentally reshaped when the starting point is no longer Google but agents that handle browsing, price comparison, and even checkout on the consumer's behalf.\"\n\nFive predictions for 2026\n\nBessemer Venture Partners\n\nMoving from the funding data and state of play, the Bessemer report details five predictions for the year ahead in AI:\n\nThe browser will emerge as a dominant interface for agentic AI. Browsers designed for AI agents include Perplexity's Comet Dia browser\n\n2026 will be the year of generative video. Generative AI's video quality will shine in 2006 as \"Model quality -- across Google's Veo 3, Kling, OpenAI's Sora, Moonvalley's Marey, and emerging open-source stacks -- is accelerating,\" they note. \"We're nearing a tipping point in controllability, accessibility, and realism, that will make generative video commercially viable at scale\" in entertainment, education, marketing, social media and retail.\n\nOpen questions are whether video will be dominated by the largest AI models, whether open-source will be competitive in video generation, and whether real-time and low-latency uses of video will become important.\n\nEvals and data lineage will become a critical catalyst for AI product development. Current ways of evaluating Gen AI are only offering \"coarse-grained signals at best,\" they write. \"Most every company still struggles to assess whether a model performs reliably in their specific, real-world use cases.\" The result is going to be a big advance in custom evaluations, they believe. \"AI evals will go private, grounded, and trusted -- and enterprise deployment will 10x because of it.\" Companies profiting from that wave may include startups as Braintrust LangChain Bigspin.ai Judgement Labs\n\nA new AI-native social media giant could emerge.

Those UPS battery backups have saved my hide on several occasions. For example, I've been hard at work on an important project, and the power goes out. Thanks to my battery backups, I have time to save all my work and safely shut down my computer until the power returns.\n\nA UPS should be considered an essential device in this digital age, especially for those who live in places that suffer from regular power surges, brownouts, and more. If you want to keep your devices up and running safely, a UPS is a must.\n\nAlso: Can a home wind turbine replace my solar panels? My results after weeks of testing\n\nWhen I recently received the Goldemate 1000 Pro UPS to review, I was surprised to find I wanted to replace my aging CyberPower UPS. Not only do the Goldemate's specs better those of the CyberPower, but the Goldemate is also more modern-looking.\n\nI know that's trivial, but when you take great pains to keep your office (TV room or whatever) nice and tidy, the last thing you might want is something that looks like a relic from the early 2000s.\n\nMy experience\n\nThe trouble with reviewing a UPS is that a thorough test requires considerable time. I've had battery backups that lasted many years and some that struggled to reach 12 months before they poop out. I've only had the Goldemate 1000 Pro for a week, but it has performed quite well.\n\nThe first thing to know about the Goldemate battery backup is that getting a Lithium-based UPS without having to shell out anywhere between $400 and $1,000 is impressive; at $199, this battery backup is a steal.\n\nAlso: The best portable power stations: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nThe next thing I appreciated about the Goldemate 1000 Pro was that all eight outlets were of the battery backup and surge protection type. On my CyberPower UPS, only half of the outlets were battery backup, which meant I had to be judicious with what I plugged into it.\n\nHowever, the strength of the battery is the real selling point of this UPS. I did one real-world test (after charging it to full) by plugging in my System76 Thelio desktop computer and monitor, and then unplugging the Goldemate from the wall to see how long it would keep those two components running.\n\nThe LCD display is easy to read and gives you all the information you need. Jack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nTo my utter shock, the Goldemate was able to keep both the computer and monitor running for nearly two hours until it powered down. Even when my CyberPower UPS was new, I was lucky to get 20 minutes from it during a power outage.\n\nWhat more needs to be said about this unit?\n\nThe only drawback to this UPS is that it doesn't include the ability to communicate with the PC. Without this feature, the UPS cannot instruct the connected computer to gracefully shut down when a power outage occurs. For me, that's not much of an issue because our power rarely goes out, and I'm at home most of the time.\n\nIf the power does go out, I can head immediately to my office and shut down anything connected to the UPS. Or, I can hope the power returns within two hours.\n\nAlso: Are backyard solar panels legit? I tested one, and here's how it saved me $30 a month\n\nIf not having a communication port on your UPS is a deal breaker, you'd be best served by finding a different unit. If, however, you do not need your UPS to communicate with your machine and need a UPS with a long-lasting Lithium battery (without having to shell out considerable cash), the Goldemate is a killer bargain.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nUninterruptible Power Supplies are not a sexy sell, but if you've ever lost data because a power outage happened while you were working on your latest novel, spreadsheet, or anything important, you understand why these things are so important.\n\nAlso: The best home battery and backup systems\n\nBeing able to grab a Lithium-based UPS at this price is a steal, and having all eight outlets for battery backup is a bonus. With winter upon us and power outages more likely to happen in certain parts of the country, you should consider purchasing a battery backup, and the Goldemate 1000 Pro sets the gold standard for a cost-effective, powerful UPS.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"pc\", \"1000\", \"installing\", \"ive\", \"cyberpower\", \"goldemate\", \"saved\", \"battery\", \"having\", \"pro\", \"backup\", \"power\", \"ups\", \"work\", \"heres\"]", "content_hash": "08a98ffde29ba5097b2f1a780f79fa2141ac1e583019b4ccb646f39d0d45eea8", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:32.296959+00:00"}

I regularly experienced triple-digit temperatures while living near the desert for ten years. But there's a big difference between that and the 100+ temperatures with humidity levels above 60% many of us are currently experiencing on the East Coast.\n\nAlso: Unplugging these 7 common household devices greatly reduced my electricity bill\n\nLike many unlucky Americans, one of the two overworked air conditioner units left us hanging during the latest heat wave. HVAC repair companies are swamped with service requests, and we were struggling, so I pulled out the EcoFlow Wave 3.\n\nThis portable unit is an upgrade from its predecessor, the Wave 2, and features Auto, Dehumidify, Sleep, and Pet modes. Aside from being relatively heavy (over 50 lb when you add a battery), the Wave 3 is easy to set up and connect to the EcoFlow mobile app. The device uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to connect to your phone, which you can then use as a remote control and to adjust settings, giving you an extra layer of convenience.\n\nI've been testing the EcoFlow Wave 3 sporadically for a few weeks, but began using it more religiously after the summer heat rolled around.\n\nMy husband's home office is well-insulated and soundproof, but it's an addition that wasn't properly incorporated into the home's existing HVAC system and doesn't have any windows. As a result, it gets very hot in summer and very cold in the winter.\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nThis room turned out to be a great place to test the Wave 3 once the dog days of summer began. By routing the exhaust vent through an existing opening built into a wall to route cords, the Wave 3 successfully lowered the temperature by almost 20 degrees in under an hour.\n\nIt maintained the set temperature for as long as the device was powered on. The battery lasted a couple of hours when used in Max mode, which is the highest setting, but you can stretch it to up to eight hours when you use it in Eco mode.\n\nAlso: My AC system isn't blowing cold air - 5 easy and quick fixes that experts recommend\n\nI found the EcoFlow Wave 3 best suited for insulated areas over tents and places not built adequately for climate control. It's a helpful comfort measure, but one you shouldn't rely on for safety.\n\nThe Wave 3 is more powerful than its predecessor, but it isn't meant to replace a full-size air conditioning unit. It features 6,100 BTU for cooling and 6,800 BTU for heating, which is about half the capacity of a wall-mounted unit that costs around a third of the price. So you're paying extra for the convenience of portability of the Wave 3, especially when paired with a battery and portable solar panels.\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nWhether that convenience is worth the price hinges mainly on the individual use case.\n\nOnce our upstairs A/C quit in the middle of a heat wave, I had to repurpose the Wave 3 from a testing unit to cool down my kids' playroom during the day and a bedroom at night. The top floor, where the heat concentrates during summer, reached up to 93 degrees, with the outdoor temperature at 102 degrees.\n\nAlso: I'm beating the heat and taking these 5 gadgets to the pool this summer\n\nMy kids are home for summer break, and they love spending time in their playroom, which has all their toys, craft supplies, and a TV, but they couldn't do it when it was 90 degrees there. I decided to set up the Wave 3 on a table in the playroom and cut out a piece of foam for the window using the stencil included with the unit.\n\nI then routed the inlet and exhaust ducts through the piece of foam and ran the Wave 3 to bring the room's temperature from 86 to 75 degrees. The inlet duct pulls the fresh outside air, while the exhaust vents the hot air from the cooling process. I also ran the drain line out the window to release the water collected during condensation.\n\nMaria Diaz/ZDNET\n\nAdmittedly, the Wave 3 struggled to cool down the room efficiently multiple times. For example, it brought the temperature down to 82 degrees in under 20 minutes on one occasion, but then it took over an hour to get to 78. The unit then maintained that temp, even if set to 75. At this time, the outdoor temperature was 96 degrees, with the midday sun shining down on the window next to the Wave 3.\n\nThis and other tests made me realize that the Wave 3's cooling capability is limited under extreme conditions, like heat waves. I look forward to seeing how the heating performs during the winter months.\n\nAlso: This power station kept my fridge running during an outage\n\nEven so, 78 degrees is much more comfortable for my kids, especially while they were all in the room with the Wave 3. They dove into setting up racetracks and doing crafts, leaving my husband and me able to work uninterrupted.\n\nBecause of this, I wouldn't rely on the Pet mode advertised by EcoFlow to keep your pets safe in a hot car. This Pet mode is meant for when you have your Wave 3 and your pet in your vehicle, and you have to leave your furry friend behind. When the EF Wave 3 detects a temperature of 77 degrees or higher, it begins cooling to prevent your pet from overheating.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nThe EcoFlow Wave 3 is built for off-grid adventurers, whether van lifers, RVers, boaters, or tiny home dwellers. However, it isn't meant to be a device you reach for in emergencies. Its performance is limited in extreme conditions, so I'd recommend it to make trips more comfortable, not to prevent heat stroke or hypothermia.\n\nIt's a practical device, with improved performance over the Wave 2 and the ability to charge it using solar energy, but it is also pretty expensive. It's effective in up to around 175 square feet but can struggle in larger areas.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"heat\", \"air\", \"buy\", \"wave\", \"temperature\", \"testing\", \"pet\", \"set\", \"summer\", \"portable\", \"cool\", \"ac\", \"degrees\", \"ecoflow\", \"unit\", \"verdict\"]", "content_hash": "85ab70729cb33a870292966352d7b27329b4b905c94a4294a972cdb781d0ede0", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:33.655759+00:00"}

We're one week away from the August Made by Google event, the tech giant's annual hardware showcase, and rumors and leaks of what's coming on this next generation of AI-infused devices are swirling.\n\nAlso: I've owned every Google Pixel since the first - here's why 2025's will be different\n\nWhat can we expect from the Pixel Watch 4?\n\nGoogle could debut new Pixel phones (including a foldable if the rumors are true), Pixel Buds, and maybe even a Google Pixel Watch 4, if I'm lucky. As ZDNET's wearables editor, I'm keeping my eye on the Pixel Watch 4 chatter.\n\nAlso: Google will announce its next lineup of Pixels on August 20 - here's what we know\n\nWhile Google has kept the details of its next hardware release discreet, a few leaks give hints about what to expect with the fourth-generation smartwatch. I've contacted the company for comment and will report back if I get any confirmation.\n\nKeep in mind that these rumors are, well, exactly that. Simply rumors. The true confirmation will only come on August 20 at Made By Google, so be sure to tune in to the livestream at 1 p.m. ET for the latest. For now, let's dive into the most exciting and notable features we could see in the Pixel Watch 4.\n\n1. Sizing and colors\n\nAccording to rumors, the Pixel Watch 4 is expected to ship in the same sizes as its predecessor: 41 mm and 45 mm.\n\nWhile sizing is staying the same, the smartwatch's colors are new this year. 9to5Google's Arsene Lupin unveiled a list of the Pixel Watch 4's colorways. They include Black/Obsidian, Gold/Lemon, Moonstone, Silver/Iris, and Silver/Porcelain.\n\n2. Same chipset, new processor\n\nAnother rumor suggests that the Pixel Watch 4 will keep the chipset from the Watch 3, the Snapdragon W5 + Gen 1. However, there are murmurs of a new processor entering the smartwatch: Google's M55 processor.\n\nAlso: The best smartwatches 2025: I wore these for weeks and found the perfect one for your wrist\n\nThis processor should enable the Watch 4 to handle five times the AI power, according to Android Headlines. The Watch 4 is going to need all the AI-processing power it can get, as Gemini arrives on the new smartwatch after debuting on the Galaxy Watch.\n\n3. New and faster charging\n\nGoogle is switching up its charging port, according to Android Headlines. Instead of a charger that rests on the bottom of the watch, Google is debuting a side-mount charger. The charging contact moved from the back to the left side of the watch, and this position switch might contribute to faster charging.\n\nThe 41mm model is slated to get 30 hours of battery life, and the 45mm model 40, according to serial leaker Evan Blass, who posted Pixel Watch 4 leaks on X. The smartwatches will also get 25% faster charging rates, according to Blass.\n\n4. Thicker watch (but bigger battery)\n\nThe Pixel Watch 3 is a hefty smartwatch already -- and the thickest I've worn. It could get even thicker, according to 91mobiles, to make room for a larger battery. The site says the fourth-gen watch has a thickness of 14.3 mm.\n\nAs someone with a small wrist, this is one unwelcome change I hope won't come to fruition. The major smartwatch competitors, Samsung and Apple, have gone slimmer with their Galaxy and Apple Watches to make the devices more comfortable to sleep in, exercise in, and wear anywhere. That thinness and levity directly relate to comfort and wearability.\n\nAlso: 8 settings to change on your Pixel phone to extend battery life\n\nHowever, battery life is a major wearability factor as well, and it's a draw for some users, so what we may sacrifice in chunkiness we make up for in an extended battery.\n\n5. Breathing emergencies feature\n\nAccording to the folks at Android Headlines, Google will expand its personal safety features with Emergency Satellite Communications and a Breathing Emergencies feature. The SPO2 sensor on the Pixel Watch 4 will monitor blood-oxygen levels and wave the red flag when they've gone too low. Blass's X post also reports heart rate variability monitoring.\n\n6. Two new buttons\n\n91mobiles also spotted two new buttons on each side of the Pixel Watch 4's speaker. If I had to guess their function, I'd bet one is for a health monitor. We're seeing more on-device health functionalities debut on smartwatches.\n\nAlso: Best Android smartwatches: I tested every popular watch so you can find the perfect fit\n\nEarlier this month, Samsung debuted an Antioxidant Index that is activated by pressing a thumb on the smartwatch's BioActive Sensor.\n\n7. Brighter display\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 could be back and brighter than ever, according to Blass. A 3,000 nits display is coming to the smartwatch, Blass reports. This places its brightness on par with the recently debuted Galaxy Watch 8 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2.\n\n8. Repairable (at long last)\n\nOne common frustration among wearable health tech users is the device's absolute un-repairability. That could soon change. Android Headlines says that the Pixel Watch 4 could (finally) be repairable, so you won't have to replace the entire watch if your display or battery breaks. This is a great step forward for environmental consciousness, customer satisfaction, and longevity.\n\nAlso: Google just gave the Pixel Watch its most important update yet - how US users can opt in\n\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"generational\", \"smartwatch\", \"leap\", \"tech\", \"google\", \"rumors\", \"battery\", \"pixel\", \"bigger\", \"headlines\", \"watch\", \"expected\", \"android\", \"according\"]", "content_hash": "67b1d2678667652988fd6a06e4db0c7fa96dad3c708b006c2478f27eb994b523", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:34.577694+00:00"}

View now at Amazon\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nI remember when smartphones started using the built-in flash as a flashlight -- it was quite revolutionary. While the flash is good enough for many situations, there are times when its power output capacity is somewhat limited, and something bigger would be welcomed.\n\nAlso: The best rugged phones you can buy\n\nEnter the Blackview BV7300 -- a ruggedized smartphone with the biggest flashlight I've seen on a phone.\n\nLet's talk hardware\n\nThe BV7300 features a 6.67-inch HD+ IPS display running at 720 by 1,604 resolution and a variable refresh rate that shifts between 60Hz and 90Hz depending on the content on the screen. To add extra ruggedness, the display is armored with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for impact and scratch resistance.\n\nIt's a passable screen, with just enough color and contrast to vividly depict apps and text, but it looks a little washed out under direct sunlight. A boost in brightness (nits) would help the phone a lot.\n\nPowering the smartphone is a 2GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio G81 chip backed by 6GB of RAM (with the ability to add a further 12GB using memory expansion, which I recommend doing), 256GB storage, and the ability to bump that up even further with a 2TB microSD card.\n\nThe BV7300 is big, thick, and weighs over two pounds! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nInside, there's a 15,000mAh battery (for comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 4,685mAh battery) that can power the unit for 57 days on standby, up to 56 hours of call time, 28 hours of web browsing, and about 16 hours of video playback. Given the size of the battery, the smartphone supports fast charging up to 45W with the appropriate charger, making charging less of a headache.\n\nAudio output is handled by a pair of 1712 box speakers that are nice and loud and have quite a decent range for a smartphone in this price range.\n\nAlso, I've never seen an Android phone that does everything that this one can (including night vision)\n\nThat's a very powerful battery, but it does add to the size and weight of the BV7300 -- it measures 8.15 x 8.11 x 1.46 inches and weighs a shade over two pounds!\n\nAnd how can I forget that giant twin COB (Chip-on-Board) flashlight on the back with a combined 800 LED modules? One panel is a warm light, the other cold, and they can be turned on independently or together to offer a maximum of 800 lumens for up to 5.8 hours on a full charge.\n\nThe light is quite impressive! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nThe contents are housed in a rugged, water- and dust-resistant polymer-armored package rated IP68/IP69K and MIL-STD-810H. This is a tough unit that can handle most drops, tumbles, and unexpected encounters.\n\nThe BV7300 boasts an impressive array of cameras, including a 50-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL JN1 Quad Bayer main camera, a 20MP SONY IMX376 night vision, and a 32-megapixel front-facing camera. The night vision camera uses built-in infrared illuminators to flood the area with light that's invisible to the eye but picked up by the camera.\n\nAlso: This $400 Motorola has no business being this good (and it comes with a stylus)\n\nFrom the shots I gathered, don't expect this phone to blow your mind. Notably, the two sensors exhibit a noticeable lack of detail and color inaccuracy, but not to the degree that portrays your subject in a totally different manner.\n\nNight vision in action ... back to the creepy Santa! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET\n\nThe SIM card tray supports dual SIM cards or a combination of a SIM card and a microSD/TF card for expanded storage. In terms of security, the device features both a fingerprint sensor and facial recognition, minimizing the time spent entering your passcode.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nAll in all, the Blackview BV7300 is an impressive package, all the more so when you check out the price and find that you can pick one up for $230. The size, weight, and crazy flashlight mean it's not for everyone, but for campers, explorers, and people who work outside, like mechanics and engineers, that light is a pretty neat feature.\n\nLooking for the next best product?

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Jada Jones/ZDNET\n\nZDNET's key takeaways\n\nSimple habits can help your headphones last much longer.\n\nRegular care keeps headphones performing like new.\n\nSmall changes can extend your headphones' lifespan.\n\nGet more ZDNET in Google: Add us as a preferred source on Search. (Works on Chrome and Chromium browsers.)\n\nI've spent plenty of time testing headphones and earbuds, and I've found a handful of small, seemingly obvious but mighty tips to keep them in tip-top shape and performance. If your headphones or earbuds aren't working like they were in their heyday, these small fixes might help.\n\nAlso: 4 headphones I swear by (and how I use each pair differently)\n\nThese tips can also help you develop healthy maintenance habits if you recently purchased a new pair of headphones or earbuds to replace your daily drivers.\n\n1. Replace your earpads (and tips)\n\nYour headphones' earpads and earbuds' eartips are more important than you think. When they're in their best shape, they maintain optimal sound quality, noise isolation, and comfort. It's normal for them to degrade over time from typical wear and tear, and once you notice tears, rips, or excessive shape distortion, it's time to replace them.\n\nMany popular headphone manufacturers, like Bose, Sony, and Apple, sell OEM replacement pads and tips, which are typically the easiest part of the headphone to self-repair. You can find cheaper third-party replacements, but you may get what you pay for. Buying OEM replacements ensures the same quality and fit, even though they may be more expensive.\n\n2. Put your headphones in their case\n\nJada Jones/ZDNET\n\nYou might keep your headphones out of their case for convenience, but storing them in their case when not in use keeps them safe from exposure to dust, debris, and humidity. Your headphones have plenty of small openings, particularly the holes on the earcups that house microphones and the charging port.\n\nAlso: Why these headphones are still the best from Bose - even though they're a year old\n\nMost over-ear headphones haven't been formally tested for dust or water ingress, and although they can handle some exposure, it's best to keep them as protected as possible. Keeping them in their case protects them from dust, dirt, moisture, and scrapes, scratches, and bumps, promoting longevity.\n\n3. Your headphones deserve proper charging hygiene\n\nYou may be familiar with battery hygiene regarding your smartphone, and similar rules apply to the rechargeable battery inside your headphones. The biggest difference is that the battery inside your headphones is much smaller and weaker than your smartphone battery, and excessive battery drain is common in older headphones.\n\nAlso: 3 charging mistakes that are killing your tablet - and the simple fix you need\n\nYour headphones likely have a one-year manufacturer's warranty, and battery issues tend to occur once it's expired. Replacing the battery yourself is possible, but it may require some soldering. To preserve your headphones' battery, try to keep it between 10% and 80% charged, and don't leave them plugged in overnight. After 45 minutes to an hour on the charging cable, your headphones should be good to go.\n\n4. Clean your headphones\n\nCleaning your headphones and earbuds is not only good for your devices, but for your ears, too.

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "I depend on earbuds to keep my runs from feeling like a chore. This is especially so during the hot summer months, when any distraction from the heat is a necessity. When I go on longer runs, I need earbuds that can not only tolerate my copious sweat, but also not constantly remind me that I have something on my ears.\n\nBecause of the amount of sweat I produce when running, I can't wear traditional earbuds (I've destroyed at least a dozen pairs), which means I have to use either bone-conducting headphones or open-air earbuds.\n\nAlso: These $15 accessories turned my AirPods into the most versatile earbuds I've worn\n\nFor the longest time, I used bone-conducting headphones, but I always found the sound they produce to be less than ideal. About a year or so ago, I started using open-air earbuds and a clip-on style. Since then, I've not had to deal with my sweat-destroying earbuds, poor sound, or discomfort.\n\nI've also tried and reviewed several different pairs, each of which had its pros and cons.\n\nWhen I received the OpenRock S2 open-air earbuds, I could have been skeptical because I had never heard of the brand. However, I've learned that earbuds have come a very long way since their early days, so even unknown brands or inexpensive pairs can catch me by surprise.\n\nSo, I went into this review without any preconceived notions.\n\nMy experience\n\nAs is with pairing most earbuds with Android, it was only a matter of unboxing the OpenRock S2s, opening he case, pulling out the earbuds, removing the protective plastic, putting the earbuds back, and then waiting for Android to find them, which took all of twenty seconds.\n\nOnce paired, I slipped the earbuds over my ears and immediately realized how comfortable they were. It's not just the shape and design but also the weight that makes them so comfortable. These earbuds weigh only 7 grams each, so you'll barely notice them.\n\nDo I have earbuds on or not? I can't tell. Jack Wallen/ZDNET\n\nThen came the important part of the test - the music. I started out with Messuggah's \"Ligature Marks,\" which was unfair of me because any song by that monstrous band can challenge the integrity of lower and mid-range earbuds and headphones.\n\nInstead of continuing with that band, I switched to Primus and \"My Name Is Mud.\" Much better. Les Claypool's bass was present but not overwhelming, Ler's guitar sounded more refined than I thought it would (given the price), and Herb's drums were nice and tight.\n\nAfter \"Mud,\" I switched to my favorite test album, \"Signals,\" by Rush. This is where the OpenRock S2 earbuds didn't exactly shine, but didn't diminish all that much. While I found the midrange was spot on, the low end lacked some definition and the highs weren't exactly crisp. That's not to say the sound was bad. It's not.\n\nAlso: I recommend these budget earbuds over pricier Bose and Sony models - here's why\n\nThe S2 earbuds make up for the lack of bottom and top with a fairly decent soundstage, so the instruments aren't glommed together such that they become indistinct. If you know Rush, then you know there's always a lot going on with their music, and the S2 earbuds didn't muddy things to the point where it sounded more like a wall of sound than a trio of the best musicians to have ever graced rock's stage.\n\nAnd although the low end wasn't exactly dynamic and refined, Geddy's bass was still very clear and agile. If you like your music more on the thumping side of things, these earbuds will disappoint. If your tastes tend to veer more toward's accurate bass notes, the S2 earbuds will not let you down.\n\nAlso: These $60 wireless earbuds made me question my audio spending habits\n\nThe important thing to remember here is that open-air earbuds are simply not capable of producing the punchy depths as traditional \"in-ear\" earbuds. I'm willing to make that trade-off to avoid destroying yet another pair with my evil, Xenomorphic sweat.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nIf you're active and are looking for a pair of earbuds you can wear all day (or at least during longer activities), the Openrock S2 open-air earbuds will not disappoint. Are these the best $99 earbuds I've ever tested? No. But they are probably the most comfortable, and no matter how active I get, they stay in place. That last factor alone makes them worth buying, especially if your activities of choice involve a lot of movement.\n\nOne last thing about the S2 earbuds. These don't have a touch surface for pausing, skipping, repeating, or repeating songs (or answering calls.\n\nThere are physical buttons at the end of the earbud (the part that sits behind your ears), which do make it a bit more challenging to interact with when you're (literally) on the run.

Now, after disappearing, NPD is back.\n\nAs ZDNET sister publication PCMag reported, NPD is open for snooping again under a new owner, the rather mysterious-sounding Perfect Privacy LLC. This company has no relationship with the virtual private network (VPN) business Perfect Privacy VPN.\n\nAlso: The best VPN services (and how to choose the right one for you)\n\nThe new NPD is back to the same old business of letting people search for personal data on friends, relatives, your ex-wife, and anyone else. While the site states it's \"not a 'consumer reporting agency' as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA),\" and that you may not use \"any information from this site to make decisions about employment, credit, insurance, housing, or other purposes covered by the FCRA,\" nothing is stopping you from using the site's data to do just that.\n\nAfter a brief review of the new NPD, I found that some of the data on the site was inaccurate or outdated. Other information, however, was spot-on. The site also appears to struggle with handling hyphenated names. That's a win for me.\n\nWhere does NPD get its information?\n\nNPD says on its site: \"We collect the data you find on our people search engine from publicly available sources, including federal, state, and local government agencies, social media pages, property ownership databases, and other reliable platforms.

Go to nationalpublicdata.com/optout.html Drop the URL into the \"Your Profile Link\" field and click \"Request Removal.\" Enter an email address, and the site will send you an email requesting that you click to confirm deletion.\n\nYou'll need a separate email address for each profile you want to delete.\n\nAlso: How to remove your personal info from Google Search - it's quick and easy\n\nThe site appears to remove your data quickly. That said, if you opt out, I'd check again in a few days to make sure.\n\nHow to check for your data on people-searching sites\n\nMind you, dealing with NPD isn't enough to erase your personal information. When I checked for my data on people-searching sites using Optery, a personal data removal service, I found my information on no fewer than 81 sites.\n\nAlso: I found the easiest way to delete myself from the internet (and you shouldn't wait to use it, too)\n\nIf you seriously don't want big data looking over your shoulder, I'd strongly recommend trying one of these services.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"leaking\", \"sites\", \"services\", \"asap\", \"site\", \"billion\", \"npd\", \"data\", \"privacy\", \"infamous\", \"information\", \"profile\", \"records\", \"remove\", \"personal\", \"search\"]", "content_hash": "45572c06dcf13f135560a2aee5bc972cb1156e57697f5919c20693556e86a047", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:38.679538+00:00"}

I don't suffer from it on a plane or ship, thankfully. But put me in the back seat of a car, and I often get hit by a bad case of it, especially if the ride is twisty and turny.\n\nTriggered by mixed signals across your eyes, inner ear, and brain, those feelings of dizziness and queasiness can be extremely uncomfortable. For anyone else who experiences motion sickness, you can turn to your iPhone for help.\n\nAlso: Installed iOS 18.6 on your iPhone? Change these 11 settings for the best experience\n\nIntroduced with iOS 18 is a helpful option called Vehicle Motion Cues. With this feature turned on, animated dots appear on the edges of the screen to help you better process changes in the movement of the car. Your goal is simply to use and navigate your phone normally.\n\nWith its built-in accelerometer, your iPhone will sense that you're traveling in a moving vehicle. When the car turns, the dots move in the opposite direction of the turn.\n\n\"Research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using iPhone or iPad while riding in a moving vehicle,\" Apple said when it unveiled the feature in 2024.\n\n\"With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly.\"\n\nHow to use Vehicle Motion Cues on the iPhone\n\nHere's how I combat my motion sickness with my iPhone and how you can do the same. You can also use Vehicle Motion Cues on an iPad with iPadOS 18 or higher.\n\n1. Update your iPhone or iPad First, make sure you're running iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 or higher.

View now at Razer\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nThe Blade 16 has been Razer's flagship gaming laptop for years, but the thinner, sleeker design on 2025's Blade 14 (the thinnest Blade model yet) gives nothing short of a stunning first impression.\n\nThe new model is 11% thinner and 11% lighter than its predecessor, weighing just 3.5 pounds and 0.6 inches thick, with a slick, matte black finish that looks and feels premium. The form challenges the brand's own aesthetic with a device that looks more like a Dell XPS 14 or MacBook Pro than a gaming laptop.\n\nAlso: Is the Razer Blade 16 finally an everyday laptop? Its new slimmed-down design says 'yes'\n\nThe physical build is certainly one of this laptop's best features. Despite its thin and light frame, it feels expressly durable, with minimal flexing or screen wobble. I also love the large rubber posts on the bottom of the device that keep it from sliding around and allow for more airflow.\n\nBy highlighting this new and improved form factor, Razer is taking aim at competing 14-inch gaming laptops, particularly the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, which reigns supreme as one of the best 14-inch gaming laptops out there (one of our favorites, as well).\n\nThere are a handful of differences between these two laptops, however, with the Blade 14 trading a little bit of that power for its svelte form factor, opening up a use case as a device that's equally capable on the Steam dashboard as it is in the office.\n\nThe 3K, 120Hz OLED display is gorgeous, going right up to the very edge with ultrathin bezels mere millimeters thick. Similarly, the trackpad is large (but not ridiculously so), going as far to the edges as it possibly can, exuding a precise, expertly crafted physical aesthetic.\n\nAlso: I answered the million-dollar question about buying laptops - here's the ultimate guide\n\nThere are trade-offs to this design, however. The thinner form means less robust cooling and limits hardware, which The Blade 14 opts for in exchange for the extra portability. You've got an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor paired with Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture in the GeForce RTX 50 series, up to the 5070, and up to 32GB of soldered RAM.\n\nKyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nSure, it's not the powerful loadout you can get on a gaming laptop, but that isn't really the point here. Razer scaled things back with the Blade 14 for a capable machine that errs on the side of battery efficiency, rather than trying to strongarm performance with heavy hardware.\n\nFor example, the Blade 14 supports 100W of total graphics power, going up to 115W with Dynamic Boost on, so technically this laptop has more than enough power to support a higher-end GPU like the RTX 5080. However, Razer likely opted for the 5070 to reign in heat and power consumption.\n\nTo compare, the 14-inch Asus Zephyrus G14 has the 5080, and that thing gets hot. Even with the fans cranking (which are not quiet), the reality of gaming on a 14-inch means accounting for these factors, of which the Blade 14 mitigates with this hardware.\n\nAlso: Finally, an ultraportable Windows laptop I'd use at the office (even though it's for gamers)\n\nGaming performance while plugged in is fantastic, with smooth, lag-free visuals in \"Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered\", \"Diablo IV\", and \"Cyberpunk 2077\". The latter, at 3K resolution, pushes things to the top end, with an average right around 40 FPS and some light visual stuttering, but nothing that feels problematic. Swapping to a more manageable 1200p resolution drastically improved performance.\n\nIn terms of benchmarking, the Blade 14 holds its own against two powerful 16-inch gaming laptops we've tested this year, the MSI Stealth 16 AI, and the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, but shows a slight dip in raw power to the hardware in those (much larger) systems.\n\nThe Blade 14 has nice I/O coverage, as well. You've got two USB4 Type-C ports with Display Port 2.1 and power delivery support on either side, two USB-A ports on either side, an HDMI port (on the right side), and a MicroSD card reader.\n\nAlso: The best laptops you can buy: Expert tested\n\nOn the left side, you also have the proprietary charging port for the 200W power brick. This is the most efficient form of power delivery, but it will charge via USB-C as long as you have the appropriate wattage. Just don't expect plugged-in performance if you're gaming on this with a 65W charger.\n\nThe RGB lighting effects on the keyboard don't disappoint, either. Razer does a great job at maximizing the intensity and punch of each individual key, with minimal light leakage from the corners of the keys for a dramatic effect.\n\nIf you like per-key customization, the keyboard here has all the effects you can ask for in the accompanying Razer Chroma app. If you want to dress things down with a more subtle, office-ready aesthetic, you can do that just as easily.\n\nThe keyboard itself feels nice, with silent activation unless you're really hammering away. However, I can see some gamers not being completely satisfied with the travel distance, as although it feels premium, it errs more toward a MacBook or business laptop than an explicit gaming board. Conversely, the speakers are alright. They're better than average, but a little lacking in bass or richness.\n\nAlso: I traded my business computer for a Lenovo Legion laptop for work, and didn't miss it\n\nThe Razer Synapse app acts as the device's dashboard for controlling everything from performance modes to overclocking to at-a-glance metrics like operating temps and CPU usage. However, the app itself feels a little unfinished, and it became unresponsive a few times during my testing. It's useful enough to manage settings, however.\n\nJust note that when you're on battery, the laptop forces you into Balanced mode -- with no option to switch out of it. Obviously, this is the preferred setting for when you're untethered from the outlet, but eliminating the option for short sprints of performance on battery power isn't my favorite thing.\n\nKyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nHopping into Balanced mode goes a long way toward maximizing battery life, however. Turning the refresh rate down to 60Hz and reducing brightness to half resulted in a little over nine hours of runtime during our battery testing -- very good for a gaming laptop.\n\nFor sustained gaming on battery, you can expect two to three hours, which is more or less standard, although less demanding games will undoubtedly push that past that to four to five. The takeaway here is that the Blade 14 can stay alive in low-demand sessions or while idle much longer than most gaming laptops, which tend to be a lot thirstier.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nThe Razer Blade 14 is a gaming laptop, but it's not limited to that use case. You can take it to the office or pack it in a travel bag just as easily as you can get those headshots in the latest top-tier gaming titles on Steam.\n\nIt's a gorgeous laptop, and it resonates with me personally as a \"mature\" gamer whose all-day gaming sessions are (mostly) a thing of the past, but still enjoys a regular portfolio of games to log into.\n\nAlso: I replaced my work PC with this Dell laptop, and it was one of my best decisions\n\nI'd recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a capable gaming laptop, but who is not interested in a massive 16- or 18-inch behemoth. In that sense, the Blade 14 speaks to the consumer who is comfortable with the trade-offs discussed and appreciates the lightweight form factor.\n\nThe Blade 14 comes in several different configurations, with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of soldered RAM and either the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 or 5070 GPU. The most high-end loadout retails regularly for $2,999, which isn't exactly cheap and requires commitment to its niche use case. However, right now, it's on sale for $2,599 -- a price that's a lot more palatable.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"blade\", \"feels\", \"ive\", \"14\", \"macbook\", \"laptop\", \"razer\", \"form\", \"written\", \"tested\", \"best\", \"performance\", \"power\", \"work\", \"gaming\", \"laptops\", \"better\"]", "content_hash": "839aacf52359d75fa6a8d1cde48b7fb076230e030c6e08220e66fa02bd9402c9", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:40.593517+00:00"}

Additionally, it has a power delivery of 98W, enough to charge both a laptop and a smartphone at the same time. I really appreciate the CalDigit TS4's size. It measures 4.46 x 1.65 x 5.55 inches and weighs about 1.4 pounds, so you can take it to the office. It can even output video signals to dual 4K displays simultaneously, helping future-proof your setup. Who it's for: CalDigit's docking station is perfect for power users with demanding tasks. If you routinely work with external drives or high-resolution displays, this device's versatility will save you from contact plugging and unplugging. It's compatible with Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS laptops. The TS4 even works with iPads. Who should look elsewhere: At nearly $400, the CalDigit TS4 is one of the most expensive options on this list, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone on a tight budget. I also wouldn't suggest the docking station to people who have a triple monitor setup. The dock can't support that many panels at once.

The former may have come out on top, but for certain people, the Kensington dock is the superior choice. It is one of the first docking stations ever to support the Thunderbolt 5 standard, and thus its USB-C ports perform significantly better than the more common Thunderbolt 4. The dock provides up to 140W of power delivery to quickly recharge devices, boasts blazing-fast data transfer speeds of up to 80 Gbps, and can support triple 4K display setups. I should mention that with the Bandwidth Boost feature, those transfer speeds can go as high as 120 Gbps. It turns any laptop setup into a full workstation.

Here's what to think about before you buy one: Connection type: This is the most important aspect to look for when shopping for a docking station. Most new laptops support USB Type-C connections, so you'll want a device that has the same type of ports. The same thing goes for older laptops. Those machines tend to support USB 3.0 meaning you will need a docking station with the same input. If you buy a station without the right support, video signal or data transferring will not work as well as it should.\n\nThis is the most important aspect to look for when shopping for a docking station.

If you buy a station without the right support, video signal or data transferring will not work as well as it should. Power: For a true one-cable connection, your dock needs to supply power to the laptop. Some cheaper options lack this, forcing people to use it solely for connecting peripherals. Others may require you to use your laptop's own charger to power them.\n\nFor a true one-cable connection, your dock needs to supply power to the laptop. Some cheaper options lack this, forcing people to use it solely for connecting peripherals. Others may require you to use your laptop's own charger to power them. Video output(s): Look closely at the specs for video connections. If you need to send a video signal to a single 1080p display using an HDMI cable, any old dock will work. Things get complicated if you need support for two or more 4K external displays. For that, you'll need a docking station with a DisplayPort connection or a more recent version of HDMI.\n\nLook closely at the specs for video connections.

Docking stations can have USB ports that are either Type A, Type C, or both. There are also docking stations lacking the ability to charge devices. Others have Ethernet ports for internet routers, freeing you from dealing with weak Wi-Fi connections.\n\nNote if the dock you're considering has enough external ports for your devices.

Having dedicated external speakers and microphones can do wonders for significantly upgrading your audio experience Show more\n\nHow did we choose these laptop docking stations?\n\n\n\nCesar Cadenas/ZDNET\n\nWe considered device specifications, important features, price points, and more when choosing the best laptop docking stations. Our guides mostly consist of popular, well-reviewed options, although we did consider docking stations with unique functionality, like the Dell Dual Charge Dock. We tested some of the options ourselves and used them in our everyday lives. We also researched and recommended models based on user reviews, brand trust, and price points. Below is a list of the criteria we followed to make our decisions.\n\n1. Connection types\n\nConnections types are crucial because they determine how well the device can meet your needs in terms of functionality, performance, and compatibility. Having the right ports can greatly enhance your productivity, and looking for models that support modern standards is important.\n\nCalDigit's TS4 has pretty much everything you could ever want on a docking station. It has Thunderbolt 4 ports that support Windows laptops, MacBooks, and Chromebooks. One of those Thunderbolt 4 ports can also be used to send a video signal from a computer to a monitor alongside the DisplayPort. You also have audio jacks, an ethernet input for a direct internet connection, and more. But quantity is sometimes just as important as quality. The Baseus 10-in-1 docking station, for example, lacks an audio jack but supports Thunderbolt 4, making it a good choice for people who want a compact device.\n\nOptions like the CalDigit and Baseus options are equally valid, so we looked for different kinds of docking stations rather than just one.\n\n2. Power delivery\n\nPower Delivery is an important feature. Many docking stations allow people to charge their laptops through USB-C or Thunderbolt ports, eliminating the need to carry a separate laptop charger. Since it's so crucial, we hunted down devices with the fastest charging speeds, such as the NewQ 16-in-1. We connected a low-battery laptop for the docking stations we had on hand and noted how quickly it recharged. Not every model supports such high speeds, but that's OK, because they have other considerations.\n\nThe CalDigit TS4 has a power delivery of 98W, which is still plenty fast, and its wide selection of ports makes up for the difference between it and the aforementioned NewQ station.\n\n3. Data transfer speed\n\nAs the name suggests, data transfer speeds affect how fast you can move files from your laptop to another computer on a small network. Higher speeds come in handy when moving large files (think video, high-resolution images, or computer backups), but you don't have much time to spare. In our tests, we could transfer a 10 GB backup of a Google account between two computers in just a few seconds.\n\nKensington's SD5000T5 Thunderbolt 5 docking station is the best in this regard, as it can achieve transfer speeds of up to 80 Gbps. This level of performance is thanks to its support of the new Thunderbolt 5 standard, allowing it to leave the other models in the dust.\n\n4. Display connectivity\n\nConnecting your laptop to multiple external displays lets you enjoy a desktop-like setup. This is one of the most defining features of a laptop docking station, enabling the tech to differentiate itself from a basic USB hub. When compiling the list, we sought devices capable of outputting to multiple high-resolution monitors at a high refresh rate. We then tested these models by connecting a laptop to a pair of 4K screens. The best ones made it onto the list.\n\n5. Price points\n\nIt would've been very easy to fill the entire list with large docking stations with 15 or more ports and fast power delivery speeds. But doing so would be a disservice to all the great low-cost models. Not everyone can afford $200 or $300 for a high-end docking station; a user might not even need something so robust. Budget-friendly models also tend to be smaller, making them easier to carry around. We even made sure the cheaper options supported the necessary standards one might want in these devices and were worth the price.\n\nLatest news on laptop docking stations\n\nPlugable's new Thunderbolt 4 dock offers dual-4K HDMI, 96W charging, and 13 ports for just under $200. It contains one Thunderbolt 4 port for a single 6K display on macOS or 8K 30Hz on a Windows device, four USB-A ports, and UHS-II SD and microSD card readers.\n\nRayCue also recently launched a new TB5 dock for Apple desktops, which uses DisplayPort and HDMI 2.1 connectivity. It can be used in conjunction with up to two SSDs and uses Thunderbolt 5.\n\nRazer's new Thunderbolt 5 dock was hotly anticipated, but now seems to be a disappointment to many users, who claimed it doesn't work with over two-thirds of Razer's gaming laptops.\n\nFAQs on laptop docking stations Why are docking station so expensive? There are several reasons that explain why docking stations are expensive accessories. For starters, they have complex designs. You can think of them as mini-computers complete with circuit boards and chips -- minus a display and their own power source. The number of total ports as well as their supporting standards and materials used in their construction contribute to the final price. Show more Why won't my laptop recognize my docking station? Fixing a laptop's inability to recognize a docking station can be surprisingly difficult, because the problem can be caused by a lot of things. Perhaps the station you purchased is faulty or something in your setup, like one of the ports, is broken. Before you do asking for a refund, the first thing you should do is install the latest drivers and BIOS updates for both the laptop and the docking station. Beyond that, make sure the cables are properly secure. Try disconnecting and reconnecting said cables. Next, ensure the correct playback device has been selected. It's possible you didn't choose the right video or audio source, which may explain there may not be any visuals or sound coming through. Show more Does leaving your laptop plugged in overnight ruin the battery? Modern laptops won't be negatively impacted by being connected to a docking station for an extended time. Battery technology has gotten much better over the years. Plus, many stations don't offer power delivery, a feature where the device will send energy to a laptop's battery, charging it. However, some docking stations offer power delivery, and it is possible (although unlikely) that these devices can harm your battery. Continuous computer usage puts extra strain on a laptop's power source, which can negatively impact your computer's ability to hold a charge. For this reason, we recommend unplugging your docking station when it is not actively being used. This is a good practice to perform to ensure battery longevity.

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Antigravity\n\nZDNET's key takeaways\n\nAction cam manufacturer Insta360\n\nIts first model, the Antigravity A1, is unique in that it can record 360-degree video at up to 8K resolution.\n\nLaunch date is slated for January 2026, but exact pricing is still unknown.\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nInsta360 this week announced its venturing into a new frontier: drones. Its new sub-brand Antigravity will focus entirely on camera-equipped drones, and today, it revealed its first product: the Antigravity A1, the world's first 360 drone that can record 360-degree videos at 8K resolution.\n\nAlso: Why I recommend this 8K pocket camera over traditional shooters - especially at this price\n\nI recently had a chance to fly the pre-production model, and it was a lot of fun. I was surprised at how easy it was to fly and shoot -- you can just concentrate on directing the drone since it records everything around it at once, making it impossible to screw up a shot. Here's a breakdown of the news.\n\nBehind the design\n\nThe Antigravity A1 is a small drone, weighing about 249 grams. This means it's small enough to where you won't need to obtain a flight license or register the drone with the Federal Aviation Administration to fly it. You can just take it out and instantly have fun with it.\n\nAlthough I don't have exact dimensions, I did get a chance to hold a pre-production model, and can confirm that it's small enough to carry with one hand. Those turbines you see in the photo below can be folded for easier storage.\n\nCesar Cadenas/ZDNET\n\nSee the world in 360\n\nThe drone has four cameras in total: two facing forward, one on top, and one on the bottom. A live feed is sent from the device to the micro-OLED displays inside Antigravity's Vision goggles. You don't see the full 360-degree view all at once; you only see a portion. To see the entire feed, you'll have to physically turn your head. Antigravity states that through \"FreeMotion technology and responsive head tracking,\" you'll be able to look \"freely in any direction\".\n\nAlso: I fell in love with a $2,000 mirrorless camera that puts design and simplicity over everything else\n\nNo matter where you look: up, down, left, right, front, back, upside down -- all you'll see is high-resolution video. There aren't any blind spots, and no part of the drone blocks the view. Insta360 told me that Antigravity utilizes \"advanced image stitching\" software to make the drone invisible to the camera.\n\nIntuitive controls\n\nInstead of the traditional double-handed controller with two analog sticks, the A1 drone is operated via Antigravity's Grip controller, which is held in one hand. To make the device move, you press down on the rear trigger to move forward. To change direction, you'll have to bank the controller to the side. Doing so moves the white circle on the headset's screen, which is what the drone follows.\n\nThe headset that gives you a POV of your drone footage. Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET\n\nIf the motion controls are too confusing, users have the option of using the scroll wheel. Above the wheel is the battery indicator, letting you know how much juice the drone has at any given moment. That big button does a couple of things depending on how you press it. A short press activates the emergency stop, while a long press initiates a \"Return to home\" function.\n\nAntigravity states the A1 drone will launch sometime in January 2026, with more information, such as pricing, bundles, and regional availability coming closer to launch.\n\nLooking for the next best product?

Pt\", \"Elyse Betters Picaro\"]", "published": null, "text": "Kerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nI've been fairly vocal recently that Samsung's One UI 7 is my favorite Android skin. It is fast, responsive, and intuitive. But nothing comes fine-tuned to your experience straight out of the box. You need to personalize your smartphone to make it more appealing. I change almost a dozen settings on every Samsung Galaxy phone to best suit my needs, and I believe these will elevate your user experience, too.\n\nAlso: The best Samsung phones to buy\n\nFrom setting the highest available screen resolution to more privacy-focused features, here are 10 Galaxy phone settings (plus a bonus) that I recommend changing to enhance your Galaxy phone experience. Please note that some settings might be phone-specific.\n\n1. Turn off pop-up notifications\n\nPrakhar Khanna/ZDNET\n\nI do not like it when a message from a contact or an intrusive app notification pops up while I am in the middle of reading online or texting my favorite people. I get distracted easily. If a notification pops up, I tap on it and forget what I was doing.\n\nAlso: Everything announced at Samsung Unpacked this week: Z Fold 7, Watch 8 Classic, tri-fold phone, more\n\nIf you are anything like me, you should change this setting even before switching to gesture navigation. Go to Notifications > Notification pop-up style > Apps to show as brief > Toggle off All apps.\n\n2. Switch to gesture navigation\n\nUnless you are setting up your new Samsung Galaxy phone from an older model, it defaults to the older three-button navigation system. If you like it, that is fine. But I find Android's gesture navigation more intuitive -- everything is a swipe away instead of an on-screen button.\n\nIf you want that, you can change the system navigation to gestures by going to Settings > Display > Navigation bar > Swipe gestures.\n\n3. Set to the highest screen resolution\n\nKerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra has the best display on a smartphone right now. Thanks to second-generation Gorilla Armor, it is less reflective and displays colors better than its predecessor. You get a sharp QHD+ screen, but it is not set to that resolution by default.\n\nYou need to go to Settings > Display > Screen resolution to get the best available display experience. It will use more battery, but the Ultra is an efficient smartphone. Even after maxing out the screen resolution, I still get an all-day battery life.\n\n4. Change the side key's function\n\nSmartphones no longer have a \"power button.\" It is called a side key or side button now, and it is one of my most disliked changes in recent times. Phone companies have renamed the power button to accommodate their smart assistants on long press.\n\nAlso: 5 preinstalled apps you should delete from your Samsung phone immediately\n\nGoogle's Gemini is available by other methods, and Bixby is not as useful anyway, so I suggest changing the side key's function to offer a power menu. You can do so by going to Settings > Advanced features > Side button > Long Press > Power off menu.\n\n5. Adjust lock screen notifications\n\nPrakhar Khanna/ZDNET\n\nOne UI 7 has changed how notifications appear on your lock screen. It is set to show icons on the top left corner by default, which is a big change from the previous card view. I prefer apps to show notifications in the latter form. To change this, you can go to Settings > Notifications > Lock screen notifications > Cards.\n\nI also hide sensitive notification content on the lock screen because I do not want anyone to walk up to my phone and see my personal messages. To change this setting, you can opt for Hide content under the same Lock screen notifications menu.\n\n6. Sign in or sign up for a Samsung account\n\nI juggle between different phones but keep coming back to Samsung phones for One UI. Having a Samsung account is a big part of the user experience on Galaxy phones. From Samsung Wallet to Samsung's own password manager, I have a lot of information saved in them.\n\nAlso: I've tested every Samsung Galaxy S25 model - and my favorite isn't the Ultra\n\nMany might want to turn to Google Passwords for better cross-device functionality, but I still recommend signing up for a Samsung account to access Galaxy Themes (more on this below) and the Galaxy Store. It will also benefit you when you move from one Samsung phone to another with a seamless transfer.\n\n7. Install this app\n\nPrakhar Khanna/ZDNET\n\nI recommend installing the Good Lock app from the Galaxy Store. It enables a slew of Samsung-exclusive features on your phone. I found the best use case for it when I was reviewing the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It features a module called Home Up that has a One Hand Operation+ function.\n\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\n\nSince the new Samsung flagship is a big phone, I set up a swipe down from the right edge to access Quick Settings. You can do the same for six shortcuts within the Short swipe and Long swipe gestures, and access many more features within the Good Lock app.\n\n8. Uninstall the bloatware\n\nSamsung Galaxy phones come with many apps that you might not use. Unlike previous years, you can now uninstall or at least disable them to save memory. For example, I do not have a Samsung TV and do not want the Microsoft Copilot app on my phone, so I uninstall TV and CoPilot, respectively. Other apps I disable or uninstall include Facebook, Samsung Tutor, and OneDrive.\n\n9. Customize the home screen\n\nPrakhar Khanna/ZDNET\n\nSamsung has some of the best widgets on a phone. I love the Calendar widget because I can adjust the transparency. As a result, it looks better and keeps the functionality intact without disturbing the layout of my home screen. I have it located on the top so everything is just a glance away, yet it never asks for attention -- unlike other opaque Calendar widgets.\n\nAlso: I bought Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025, but I'd recommend this model instead\n\nI also change my icon grid to the 5x5 layout to accommodate more icons on the bottom-most row. They are just a thumb tap away. Additionally, I apply my wallpaper color tones to the app icons for a more pleasing look. You can go to Wallpaper and style > Color palette and toggle it on to apply wallpaper colors to the whole system. It is not perfect, and some icons might still not be supported. However, it looks better than the basic colors.\n\n10. Fix always-on display\n\nYou get efficient displays on Samsung phones -- make use of them and enable everything, including the Always On display. I like having the time, day, and date information right there on the screen, available at a quick glance. Samsung defaults it to the Tap to show setting, meaning you need to tap on the screen for information.\n\nI recommend changing that to Always to make it more functional. Go to Settings > Lock screen and AOD > Always-on Display > Always. You can choose if you want to display the wallpaper or not -- I have set it to just display a black screen so it does not drain more battery.\n\nBonus. Revert changes to the Notification Panel\n\nPrakhar Khanna/ZDNET\n\nSamsung changed its notification panel design to an iOS-like drawer. A right swipe down gives you access to Quick Settings, whereas a swipe down from the left side of the screen gives you access to notifications. However, if you like the previous design better, you can change it.\n\nI like having my notifications under Quick Settings, like the good old days. To revert this new design element, swipe down from the top right corner of the home screen > Pencil icon > Panel Settings > Together. You can also edit the top quick settings within this menu.\n\nAlso: Every Samsung Galaxy S25 model compared: Which phone should you buy?\n\nA few other things I do on my Galaxy phones include changing the keyboard to Google Keyboard and sorting the home drawer icons in alphabetical order so it is easier to navigate. Samsung phones are some of the best on the market. While they do not promise over-the-top features, they are reliable and offer the most polished user interface with One UI. Just adjust these few settings, and you are all set.

I especially appreciate the secure storage silo in the protective case. The larger diameter of the S Pen made it easy to use with gloves on, and the display can be manipulated in glove mode.\n\nMatthew Miller/ZDNET\n\nThree physical buttons on the bottom of the tablet, in landscape orientation, make it easy to unlock and navigate the user interface. A lime green button on the top, identified as the active button, can be customized with actions for press and press/hold actions.\n\nAlso: I replaced my Samsung S25 Ultra with this rugged model that's half the price - and don't regret it\n\nIn addition, the side button above the volume buttons can be set up with double-press and long-press actions, so there are plenty of options for accessing your favorite apps and utilities through physical button actions, as anyone with experience working in the field will appreciate.\n\nMatthew Miller/ZDNET\n\nThe display is not as vibrant as I am used to with AMOLED phones and watches, but it worked well for the outside conditions where I was using the tablet. The long battery life was more important for keeping me powered up while navigating the remote wilderness and if you are looking for a rugged tablet for field work then the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro is definitely a tablet to consider.\n\nZDNET's buying advice\n\nIf you're looking for a tablet to use outside the office or in conditions where it'll be subjected to the elements, you should consider a rugged tablet made for those use cases. The Samsung Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro is built to perform for years with very long battery life, several physical buttons to navigate the tablet, and eight years of updates.

Buying a used phone or computer was like rolling the dice: you never knew exactly what you were getting.\n\nWell, the times certainly have changed. And, in this economy, the prices on refurbished tech are looking more and more tempting. Consumers are challenging this idea that we're all supposed to buy brand new phones and laptops every few years, and in the process, the market for refurbished tech has blown up.\n\nAlso: Should you buy a refurbished iPad? I tried one from Back Market and here's my verdict\n\nHaving never purchased a refurbished product myself, I was very curious as to how the experience would go with a new (used) laptop. So, I connected with the folks at Back Market and acquired a $950 MacBook Pro M1 from 2021 to test out as my main driver for a few weeks.\n\nI'll say right now: it wasn't a perfectly seamless experience, but buying brand new tech rarely is, either. Here's how it went, and what I've learned from the process.\n\nHow Back Market works\n\nMacBook Pro M1 (14-inch) Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nFirst thing you should know is that the retailer offers different tiers of products: you can buy a MacBook in Fair, Good, Excellent, or Premium condition, with the prices scaling higher with better condition. If you're wondering what Fair condition looks like, it could include some visible signs of use, but ultimately, the internal parts have been inspected and verified by Back Market to be in good working order.\n\nAfter choosing the level of wear you're comfortable with, you then go through and choose the processor, memory amount, storage, and color of your new MacBook -- just like you would a brand new one.\n\nAlso: Your MacBook is getting a major upgrade for free - 5 MacOS 26 features I'm trying right now\n\nLastly, you can choose to include a trade-in with another device as part of the purchase. This process consists of a Back Market rep appraising your device and giving you an offer in a dollar amount. You then have 21 days to ship the item to Back Market, and once they get it, they'll cut you a rebate check.\n\nCan you trust a refurbished item?\n\nMacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) Kerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nI don't blame you for being wary of used tech. But keep in mind that Back Market only takes in products it knows it can resell, and even then, it has to pass a 25-point inspection test to ensure they're in good enough condition.\n\nThis testing, repair, and parts replacement process is what sets a refurbished MacBook apart from a used one you'd buy straight from the hands of someone on Facebook Marketplace, for example.\n\nBesides a few signs of wear and tear (which you can realistically expect from a device in the Fair or Good categories), the primary thing to consider is the device's battery life. Luckily, you can see your MacBook's battery capacity in the settings, along with a host of other information, including how many cycles it's gone through.\n\nAlso: MacBook Pro vs. MacBook Air: How to decide which Apple laptop you should buy\n\nThe rule of thumb is to replace a battery that has dipped below 80% capacity, so a device purchased through Back Market should be above that mark, with Premium tier devices certified to be above 90%.\n\nThe MacBook Pro M1 I got from Back Market arrived in the Premium tier, so there was actually not a scratch or dent on the device at all. The screen looked flawless. The battery capacity was at 95%, and I had no issues with the keyboard or trackpad.\n\nThe only issue I experienced was that a day or two after I first set it up, it randomly booted up in recovery mode, prompting me to reinstall the latest OS. I did so, and it hasn't happened again since.\n\nHow much do you save?\n\nHere's the big question. How much are you really saving? Let's break it down based on three different comparable MacBook Pros from different generations: the M1 Pro I got from 2021, the M2 from 2023, and the latest MacBook Pro on the market, the M4 from 2024:\n\nCPU Memory/Storage Price MacBook Pro M1 14\" (Refurbished) M1 Pro 10-core 16GB, 1TB $958 MacBook Pro M2 14\" (New) M2 Pro 10-core 16GB, 1TB $1,579 MacBook Pro M4 14\" (New) M4 Pro 10-core 16GB, 1TB $1,799\n\nThe refurbished M1 is not available new from most retailers, but you can still get new M2s from Amazon. As you can see, it's significantly cheaper -- over $600 less -- than the next generation up with comparable hardware. The difference between the M2 and M4, however, is smaller; just a few hundred dollars.\n\nIf you're wondering how they compare, CPU benchmarking results from Geekbench put the M1 and M2 10-core CPUs quite close together, with the M4 understandably a bit further off. These numbers refer to the CPU's performance limits under a heavy load, showing that the newer MacBooks have more power under the hood on the top end.\n\nAlso: The MacOS 26 public beta is here - How to install (and which models support it)\n\nBut the differences are not earth-shattering, here. When it comes to everyday tasks like working out of a browser, running productivity software, and multitasking with different apps across the latest MacOS, the difference in performance is not as easy to identify.\n\nAnd yes, the M1 MacBook Pro will be able to upgrade to the all-new MacOS 26 Tahoe when it comes out this fall, meaning it'll have the same operating system as newer MacBooks.\n\nGeekbench Single-Core CPU Geekbench Multi-Core CPU MacBook Pro M1 14\" (Refurbished) 2,451 10,983 MacBook Pro M2 14\" (New) 2,648 12,310 MacBook Pro M4 14\" (New) 3,742 14,693\n\nThe final verdict\n\nMacBook M1 Pro running the MacOS 26 Tahoe public beta. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nSo, should you buy a refurbished MacBook? If you want to enjoy the latest features like iPhone mirroring, the new and improved spotlight, and the liquid glass UI redesign in MacOS 26 and don't need the top-of-the-line processing power, then absolutely, yes.\n\nYou can get a refurbished MacBook Pro M1 with 16GB of unified memory for $841 less than a MacBook Pro M4 with a 10-core CPU. If you're not editing 4K video, animation, or rendering large image files, a top-tier processor might be overkill.\n\nAlso: How to make any MacOS app start at login - to save you time and clicks\n\nThat being said, by choosing a refurbished laptop, you'll want to carefully weigh the trade-offs. Make sure you're opting for enough local storage to future-proof your device, decide what kind of physical condition you're comfortable with, and make sure the device you choose has a healthy battery.\n\nLastly, keep in mind that Back Market is not the only place to purchase refurbished MacBooks, Apple has its own official refurbished store where you can purchase everything from MacBooks to iPads to Apple Watches.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"m4\", \"market\", \"macbook\", \"m1\", \"math\", \"refurbished\", \"pro\", \"advice\", \"device\", \"viable\", \"macos\", \"expert\", \"2025\", \"youre\", \"heres\", \"m2\"]", "content_hash": "ac62e87240818e3cd51d6d455077dcebf49b645f5f3a3799e1e1ea70d0b0e5b4", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:48.351526+00:00"}

Pt\", \"Kyle Kucharski\"]", "published": null, "text": "Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nI used to struggle when shopping for a new computer. Over time, I learned to narrow things down to what I call the \"performance trifecta\" -- three main components you should be mindful of when buying a laptop or desktop: processor, storage drive, and RAM. The first two are pretty easy to figure out. A good processor ensures that a computer performs well, and a lots of local storage means you'll have plenty of room for all your files.\n\nAlso: One of the best work laptops I've tested has MacBook written all over it (but it's even better)\n\nMemory is a component I don't think many people fully understand or pay attention to (I was certainly a part of this group). RAM, or random access memory, is essentially a computer's short-term memory. Instead of saving data directly onto an SSD, the computer stores files temporarily in the RAM for quick access. That way, the device won't need to use its storage to open a document or software resources, ensuring fast performance.\n\nThere's a lot of information and differing opinions regarding RAM and how much you need on your computer. Should you opt for the laptop with the 32GB LPDDR5X RAM, or will 16GB be enough? I'm here to cut through all the fog and provide easy-to-understand advice on the amount of memory you should get.\n\nHow much RAM do you need in 2025?\n\nKerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nThe short answer: it depends on the operating system. For Windows machines, 16GB of RAM has become the operational minimum on new consumer laptops. Modern workloads have ramped up to such a degree that less RAM on a Windows device is fine, but it will limit you to everyday tasks like writing emails, internet browsing or watching YouTube videos.\n\nBut let's be real here: the average worker is probably running dozens of tabs in their browser, a handful of apps in the background, and (possibly) generative AI, all of which demand memory power. In that sense, most people using their Windows laptops for work will want at least 16GB (for a value-driven, future-proof option) for a smooth user experience.\n\nAlso: Why I highly recommend the M4 MacBook Air to most people (and now it's on sale)\n\nWhen it comes to MacBooks, things are a little bit different. Because Apple's machines are so optimized to handle daily workflows, 8GB of RAM goes a bit further than a stock laptop running Windows. In fact, it wasn't until only recently that Apple made 16GB the starting point with the new MacBook Air M4.\n\nMacBooks with 8GB are still solid machines for daily use, while more powerful models like the MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max offer substantial power with 24GB, 36GB, or more, making them some of the most powerful laptops on the market (and some of the priciest).\n\nBesides just Windows and Macs, Chromebooks are a third category of consumer laptops that have seen a spike in popularity over the last few years due to their average lower price and lightweight operating system: ChromeOS.\n\nBecause ChromeOS is so streamlined, Chomebooks can get along just fine with 8GB or even less, making them great machines for handling the basics like working out of the browser and having your Google Suite at your fingertips with snappy performance and a low price. The trade-off, however, is that you'll have less access to apps you'd otherwise find on Windows.\n\nAlso: Is a refurbished MacBook viable in 2025? I did the math, and here's my expert advice\n\nAll in all, it's true to say that the more memory you have, the better your computer should perform. But having too much RAM can also be a poor return on investment because you end up spending money on a resource that you hardly ever use to its fullest extent. It's like owning a big house but only using a few of the rooms.\n\nWhen buying a new laptop, I just recommend having a clear understanding of what you want to use it for -- that way you can make a realistic expectation about how much RAM you need.\n\nWhat does DDR5 mean?\n\nKyle Kucharski/ZDNET\n\nSometimes, when shopping for a computer, you'll see the letters \"DDR\" followed by a number. This is an acronym that stands for \"double data rate.\" Without getting too deep into the weeds, DDR is a type of technology that improves the data transfer speed from RAM to other components, such as the processor. There have been five main DDR generations so far, with the latest and fastest standard being DDR5.\n\nAlso: I found the 5 best laptop sales - just in time for back to school\n\nSimilar to 16GB of memory, DDR technology has effectively become the new standard for RAM as users demand faster speeds. There are also variations of the technology. A notable version is LPDDR5X, which stands for low-power double data rate 5X, a more energy-efficient version of DDR5 designed specifically for mobile devices.\n\nDon't expect DDR6 RAM to be released for a computer near you anytime soon. We saw the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) announce the release of LPDDR6 back in early July. The JEDEC is the organization that established DDR as a standard for computers. The technology is available for manufacturers to implement in their devices, but whether or not it'll happen -- or how soon -- is yet to be seen.\n\nWant more laptop advice? Add ZDNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nWhen should you upgrade?\n\nJason Hiner/ZDNET\n\n16GB is fine for most cases, although if you're a gamer or creative professional, you should consider opting for 32GB of RAM. More RAM will ensure that the games you play and the video-editing apps you use for work operate more smoothly. I have that amount for my personal computer, and I'm very happy with that setup because I don't just write.\n\nI also play games on my desktop, edit photographs and videos, and run virtual machines, among other things. It's a heavy workload that requires the correct amount of resources to operate; even then, I am considering upgrading my PC to have more. It's not uncommon for me to see my workload take up over 70% of my computer's total RAM.\n\nAlso: The best mini PCs you can buy\n\nI consider anything above 32GB of memory excessive unless you're a specific type of user. If you're editing 8K videos or running heavy apps simultaneously, then you'll probably need 48GB or 64GB of RAM. A good laptop that can deliver would be something like the M4 MacBook Pro or the Dell Premium 16. These are solid, top-of-the-line machines capable of tackling tough workloads.\n\nWhy should you trust me? I've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I choose to make my main computer, as I want to ensure the devices I use can handle my day-to-day tasks. I'm on my computer all day, practically every day of the week. Also: I tested several AIO computers in 2025, and these are the best for your office setup I'm also at a point where I've tried just about every type of laptop on the market. I know which features and specs you should look out for when purchasing a new computer -- and which ones are not worth your time. The advice I have given is not a set of hard and fast rules. I just aim to provide a foundation of what you should look for in a laptop. What is best for you depends on your unique needs.

Google has been slowly integrating the feature, which lets you ask Gemini about anything on your screen (or that you can see with your camera), into its suite of apps since June.\n\nGemini Live is getting a little more useful this week, as it's officially rolling out for Calendar, Keep, Maps, and Tasks apps.\n\nAlso: Gemini adds powerful new Deep Think model - what it does and who can try it\n\nFirst noticed by 9to5Google, most users are now seeing Google's real-time AI voice assistant across new apps. You can tell if the update has hit your device by opening the Gemini app, tapping the Live button in the bottom right corner, and looking directly above the Live controls.\n\nIf you have the capability, you'll see small chips for the connected apps when Gemini Live is accessing them.\n\nGemini Live's new tricks\n\nCalendar\n\nWith Calendar, you can check your events for the day, make a new event with your voice, and even use your camera to point at details (like date and time) to add that event to your calendar. I gave this a quick test with a flyer for a school event, and I was surprised at how easy it was.\n\nAlso: Have stock questions? Google Finance tests new AI chatbot\n\nWhat really blew me away, though, was when I tried it with my alma mater's football schedule for the upcoming fall season. I asked Gemini to add all the home games since I'm a season ticket holder. The AI was able to discern which games were home games and add the events to my calendar, including time and opponent. Live even went down the list, recapping, \"I've added games against App State, Georgia, Army… to your Calendar.\"\n\nMaps\n\nGemini Live for Maps is useful for getting guidance to a certain spot, and it even works with other Google apps. I asked Live to \"guide me to the event that's on my calendar today\" (the same school event I added earlier), and it showed me the way. It didn't pull up Maps by itself, but it did create a link I could easily tap to get going.\n\nTasks\n\nWhen it comes to Tasks, Gemini Live can show your saved lists. You could do this on your own easily by pulling up the Tasks app, but Live is an easier way to access your lists. I was able to add tasks to my list and see what was on my to-do list.\n\nKeep\n\nSimilar to Tasks, Keep's integration with Google Live is simple but makes an existing capability a little easier to access. I was able to add notes to Keep.\n\nThe new capability is available on both the Android and iOS versions of Gemini Live.\n\nAlso: Google's Jules AI coding tool exits beta with serious upgrades - and more free tasks\n\nAs a reminder, you can turn off Gemini in your Gmail, Docs, Photos, and more if you'd rather not have anything to do with Google's AI.", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"calendar\", \"event\", \"add\", \"ios\", \"google\", \"included\", \"biggest\", \"gemini\", \"app\", \"tasks\", \"maps\", \"versions\", \"games\", \"update\", \"live\", \"ai\", \"gave\"]", "content_hash": "4873eeaf69e00533c6e7ab4869e115a7f850e14169085f68be133e8d7ceec5e3", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:50.609067+00:00"}

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Bahadir Eroglu/Getty Images\n\nThere is little debate that AI will revolutionize working practices, but there is less agreement about the best way to exploit this transformation.\n\nWhile 90% of CIOs are piloting AI or investing in small or large-scale developments, over two-thirds (67%) haven't seen measurable ROI, according to the recently released Nash Squared/Harvey Nash Digital Leadership Report.\n\nAlso: 4 ways to scale generative AI experiments into production services\n\n\"Leaders know the technology, but they're struggling with its application in the business to create value,\" Nash Squared CIO Ankur Anand told ZDNET during a conversation about the key points emerging from the leadership survey.\n\nSo, how can business leaders overcome this struggle? Four business leaders provide their best-practice tips for using AI to solve big business problems.\n\n1. Create a top 10 list\n\nJoe Depa, EY's global chief innovation officer, said your use cases should align with your highest-value business priorities.\n\nHe told ZDNET that this alignment must be a continual work in progress. Business leaders should keep refreshing their approach to focus on the areas that matter.\n\n\"I often use a top 10 list, just to keep it simple,\" he said. \"Here are the top 10 use cases that we'll focus on. Anything more than 10 and there's a danger people lose interest.\"\n\nDepa said reviewing priorities for the top 10 list with other senior executives requires a firm, strategic hand.\n\n\"If people want to add things, I'll say, 'What will we take off the list?' Because when you add something to the list, you've got to take something off,\" he said. \"That approach helps keep people focused. Once you have that regular cadence, updated and refreshed, people can start thinking about applying AI to use cases.\"\n\nDepa said this careful strategy helps businesses avoid spending money on AI solutions that don't hit their ROI metrics.\n\nAlso: 5 ways to turn AI's time-saving magic into your productivity superpower\n\n\"It's usually when you don't have a clear use case or business value attached, but you have a cool problem that you want to solve. Those are the ones that you have to say, 'Hold on a second. I know that's a cool problem, but what's the business case?'\" he said.\n\n\"That's where you can get in a bit of a rut if you go down a path of just trying to solve some problems with AI, without having a clear business case for its application.\"\n\n2. Run hackathon sessions\n\nAdobe CIO Cindy Stoddard said her IT team has used AI in many areas and works with the rest of the business to identify other use cases.\n\nHer team used AI to explore past IT requirements and create recommendations so business analysts and product managers know what will likely be required when users demand a new service.\n\nAlso: Is your business AI-ready? 5 ways to avoid falling behind\n\nThe IT team also used AI in testing to create scripts that can be reused to automate repetitive processes.\n\nFor new use cases, the team runs hackathons that help surface applications for emerging technology within IT and across the business.\n\n\"People submit different ideas about what they think could change,\" she told ZDNET. \"We encourage everyone to submit areas for improvement around what they see at the ground level.\"\n\nStoddard's team then works with business peers and external partners to select the best projects.\n\nAlso: The top 20 AI tools of 2025 - and the No. 1 thing to remember when you use them\n\n\"People who submit ideas put together teams. We'll also bring in some of our key vendor partners to help train staff on the technologies,\" she said. \"Then we'll go through a development and judging process to see if the ideas deliver value. Many of the ideas we deliver end up in our production systems.\"\n\n3. Learn through failure\n\nCaroline Carruthers, CEO at consultant Carruthers and Jackson, told ZDNET about five ways to prepare an organization for an AI transformation.\n\nHowever, she also mentioned something crucial to identifying the right use cases -- embracing innovation.\n\nCarruthers said there's lots of emerging technology to test, from large language models to causal AI.\n\n\"You don't know how this tech will fit in your organization. Waiting until things are perfect with AI won't work,\" she said. \"You need to experiment. You need to carve off a little safe sandbox, something you can start and play with to understand how your organization can get the best from AI.\"\n\nAlso: 5 ways to manage your team more effectively in the AI-enabled enterprise\n\nLike other business leaders, Carruthers said it's important that the projects you support focus on the right areas. That targeting can mean learning by failure, as long as it's not too expensive.\n\n\"If you're genuinely going to experiment with AI, then you almost need to get into celebrating failure,\" she said. \"Conducting an experiment and finding out the experiment didn't work, but learning something new, is a valid use of an organization's time. Just don't spend a lot of money doing it.\"\n\nCarruthers said every AI initiative should be part of a larger project to overcome big organizational challenges.\n\n\"Innovation is about making AI part of the business, but it's doing it small, iteratively, and safely. When we talk about experiments, and especially when we talk about data, because it can solve some of the world's biggest problems, our brains tend to go, 'Oh, look at all the stuff we can do,'\" she said.\n\n\"But if we try to tackle that problem, it's big, unwieldy, and we'll get bored, and we won't deliver things in time. Whereas, if you solve a small problem, it's like, 'Oh, that's nice,' and then you solve other problems.\"\n\n4. Educate your employees\n\nTobias Sammereyer, team lead for performance engineering at XXXLutz, said many people are lulled into a false sense of security, thinking that easy-to-use tools like ChatGPT can be applied to any business case.\n\n\"We need to educate our guys how to use AI stuff properly, and how to be precise with their prompts to get what they want,\" he said.\n\nSammereyer told ZDNET that business and digital leaders must help their people understand AI's benefits and limitations before they apply the technology to use cases.\n\n\"Try to tell them what's possible, but also what's not possible, because there are two kinds of people -- one thinks AI is just hype and the other believes they can do anything with it. And both are incorrect.\"\n\nAlso: AI agents aren't just assistants: How they're changing the future of work today\n\nSammereyer said the key to success is finding the middle ground.\n\n\"Educate people, and then you can use AI, especially with generative AI,\" he said. \"Just be aware that AI can make mistakes in the same way that a human being can make mistakes. Double check the results, and then you're good to go.\"\n\nHe said this process relies on your AI systems being fed enough reliable data.\n\n\"AI is like a people pleaser. The tools want to give you a good answer -- if it's correct or not, that's up to you to double-check,\" he said. \"So, you need to be critical in your thinking and see if the AI system has enough data and is equipped to give you the right answer. Just remember that it will give you an answer, but not necessarily the correct one.\"\n\nWant more stories about AI?

I've found three products to help with this problem -- a few dollars spent can revitalize your AirPods experience.\n\nAlso: Best AirPods 2025: I've tested every pair of Apple headphones and earbuds\n\nUnfortunately, some people's ear anatomy simply isn't compatible with certain earbuds, and the best option may be purchasing from another brand. But if you're determined to make your AirPods stay in your ear, try these tips first.\n\n1. Detachable ear hooks\n\nJada Jones/ZDNET\n\nIf you like to run or weightlift, the impact of your feet hitting the ground or the explosiveness of specific compound movements can shift your AirPods in your ears. Earbuds with ear hooks, like the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, provide the in-ear stability to keep them in your ear for your entire workout.\n\nIf you don't want to buy another pair of earbuds, you can purchase detachable ear hooks to attach to your AirPods. I tried the Icarerspace hooks from Amazon. You get two pairs of hooks for $16, and this product has 4/5 stars out of 1,591 reviews.\n\nAlso: Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. AirPods Pro 2: Which earbuds are best for working out?\n\nThese ear hooks are compatible with AirPods Pro and all base model AirPods. I tested them on my AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4. The ear hooks clip onto the AirPods' stem, and then you can rock and roll.\n\nThe stems offer more in-ear stability for dynamic movements like running, biking, walking, and exercises that require bending over or lying on a bench, like bench presses or push-ups. I found that I didn't have to adjust my AirPods in between sets.\n\nThese stems aren't as comfortable or high-quality as the stems on the Powerbeats Pro 2, and after a few hours, they began to irritate the back of my ear. I'm generally not a fan of ear hooks; even the better quality ones irritate my ears.\n\n2. Silicone wings\n\nJada Jones/ZDNET\n\nSilicone wings or grips are an option if you don't want plastic ear hooks to go around your ears. I tried the Proof Labs silicone wings from Amazon. For $16, you get four pairs in different sizes, a storage pouch, and a carabiner for portability. You can buy them for AirPods Pro 1 and 2, and AirPods 4. Out of 22,100 ratings, this product has 4.3/5 stars.\n\nThese wings cover the AirPods' bud and sit at the top of your concha, or the top part of the ear's thick cartilage fold. The Proof Labs wings eliminated the extra space in my ear for my AirPods to wiggle around, offering stability and comfort.\n\nAlso: I wore the best headphones from Sony, Bose, Apple, and Sonos: Here's how the AirPods Max wins\n\nI found the wing tips helpful when working out, but they also helped my AirPods Pro 2 create a better seal in my ear. During a long car ride, I forgot my beloved Sonos Ace and had to resort to my AirPods. The improved fit and seal in my ear made for maximized audio and noise cancellation performance.\n\nIf you find that too much external noise reaches your ears due to loose AirPods, these silicone wings could help. Like the detachable ear hooks, these silicone tips must be removed before placing your AirPods back in their charging case.\n\n3. Ear tip replacements\n\nIf you want to try an option that doesn't need to be removed to put your AirPods back in their charging case, the Azla Crystal silicone ear tip replacements are ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner's product of choice.\n\nAlso: I've used my AirPods Pro 2 since their 2022 release. Are they still worth it in 2025?\n\nThese ear tip replacements are fairly priced, coming in at two pairs of tips for $15 (at the time of writing). They're only compatible with AirPods Pro models and received 4.1/5 stars out of 1,248 reviews. Thanks to their less slick surface, users say these tips provide a more stable fit than the original AirPods Pro tips.\n\nFAQs Why do my AirPods keep falling out? The main culprit of loose, ill-fitting AirPods is your ear anatomy. Everyone's ear shape is different, and some are better suited for AirPods than others. For the non-Pro model AirPods, if your concha bowl is too small, they may fall out. If your antihelix ridge (the piece of cartilage that sticks out into the concha bowl) is too flat, it may not be able to hold and secure your AirPods in your ear. The AirPods Pro 2 use silicone tips to stay in your ear, but those are highly dependent on your ear canal depth and width. If your outer canal is too shallow or narrow, your AirPods may not seal properly in your ear, leading to poor audio, noise cancellation, and fit. Accessories like the ones in this article can help, but if they don't, your best bet may be to try another brand with different earbud shapes or consider over-ear headphones instead.

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Jada Jones/ZDNET\n\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\nSoundbars are gaining in popularity because of their sleek design and ability to provide an ample boost in audio quality compared to built-in TV speakers. Even with their plug-and-play nature, you can make a few modifications to help unleash the best possible sound quality.\n\nAlso: I replaced my Sonos Arc Ultra with this Samsung flagship soundbar - and it's a worthy alternative\n\nWhether you're new to soundbar setups or a self-proclaimed audiophile, familiarizing yourself with some key settings can elevate your viewing and listening experience. Read on for five pointers on how to optimize your soundbar's performance.\n\n1. Placement and acoustics\n\nIt may sound obvious (because it is), but where you place your soundbar is a major factor. For the most balanced sound, position the soundbar directly below your TV, centered and parallel to the screen. Mounting a soundbar above your screen is also an option, but the ideal height placement for ultimate clarity is at or near ear level. Make sure your soundbar isn't obstructed by furniture or even decorative items that can block sound waves.\n\nAlso: I changed 3 settings on my PS5 to significantly improve the performance\n\nEach room has unique acoustics. Does your room have high ceilings or large windows? Are your floors hardwood or tile? If so, consider adding soft furnishings such as rugs and curtains to reduce reflections. You could also take it a step further by adding acoustic panels or diffusers to your area. Acoustic panels or diffusers can help manage sound reflections and create a more balanced audio environment.\n\nAs noted by ZDNET contributor Artie Beaty, advanced soundbars like LG's S95TR go through a tuning process specific to the layout of your viewing area by using an AI room calibration feature. If your soundbar lacks such a feature, do some experimenting to find the sweet spot.\n\nAlso: Don't cancel Netflix yet: I used these secret codes to unlock the full catalog of shows\n\nRemember that most soundbars are designed to project sound directly toward the audience, so make sure the device is angled for optimal sound dispersion across all seating positions. Moving the soundbar a foot or so from your listening area or adjusting the angle just a few inches can noticeably improve or degrade the output.\n\n2. Subwoofer location means everything\n\nKerry Wan/ZDNET\n\nIf your soundbar has a subwoofer, place it on the floor, preferably in a corner or along a wall, to enhance bass response. The aim is to create a seamless blend between low-frequency effects and the rest of the audio spectrum.\n\nI've read about a music producer who would do a \"crawling test\" to pinpoint the best location. This involves playing some bass-heavy content and literally crawling around the room to find the spot with the most balanced bass output. Voila -- there's the best place to put your subwoofer.\n\nAlso: What is spatial audio? Here's everything you need to know\n\nSome soundbars come with a built-in subwoofer, and others allow you to connect an external subwoofer wirelessly or via a wired connection. (More on this later.)\n\nIn the absence of a subwoofer, and if it's in your budget, consider adding a unit like the SVS SB-1000 Pro. A more affordable option is the Klipsch Reference R-120SW. Hooking up a subwoofer can significantly enhance your audio experience with deeper, more impactful low-frequency effects, making you feel like you're part of the onscreen action.\n\n3. Customizing your soundbar's equalizer and audio settings\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, some soundbars feature automatic calibration systems that use a microphone to measure and adjust sound settings for your specific room. Many more of them come with various audio presets or EQ settings that you can adjust according to your tastes. Certain soundbars offer the flexibility to tailor audio settings for individual inputs, allowing you to fine-tune the sound quality based on whether you're watching shows, listening to music, or gaming.\n\nIn any case, adjusting bass, treble, and other parameters can greatly improve audio quality based on your room's acoustics and your listening habits. Also, make sure to experiment with any advanced features, such as Virtual Surround Sound, Dialogue Enhancement, or Bass Boost, if available.\n\nAlso: I spent hours demoing Samsung's newest soundbar, and this one feature separates it from the bunch\n\nIncreasing the bass can add depth and power to action scenes, making explosions and other intense moments more dramatic and engaging. Raising the dialogue levels puts a focus on the center channel and midfrequencies, making vocals more distinct and easier to comprehend -- so you can actually understand what Yennefer of Vengerberg is whispering in The Witcher.\n\nAlong those lines, check to see if your soundbar has a volume leveler. This feature (which can be turned on and off) lets you listen to content with greater consistency. You'll be reaching for the volume button on your remote much less frequently with volume leveling.\n\n4. Check your (HDMI) connection\n\nMichael Gariffo/ZDNET\n\nYour soundbar is likely connected to your TV via an HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) or eARC (enhanced Audio Return Channel) port. This technology supports advanced 3D audio formats such as Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and Sony 360 Reality Audio for a super-immersive surround-sound experience.\n\nIdeally, your soundbar will support HDMI-CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) connectivity, which lets you command devices connected through HDMI by using only one remote control. In this scenario, you can use your TV's remote to control the soundbar and, for instance, an added Blu-ray player.\n\nAlso: What is EQ and why is it an important factor in improving sound?\n\nIntegrating the operation of multiple devices into one is certainly my preference. Who wants three separate remotes sitting on their coffee table? Having all your devices plugged into the soundbar reduces clutter and avoids having to install a switch box. You can then easily switch between audio sources by changing the soundbar's input mode using your single remote.\n\nOK, this doesn't pertain to maximizing audio quality, but here's something that does. Compared with connecting your soundbar via Bluetooth, a wired connection remains the best method for transferring sound. Opting for a wired connection, such as HDMI or optical cables, guarantees a stable and lossless audio transmission.\n\nThis allows the audio content to be heard as it was intended, without any degradation or disruptions caused by wireless signal interference or compression. Also, keep in mind that not all cables are created equal. Be sure to use a cable that supports high-res formats and has a higher bandwidth that can process more channels to support extra bass and tweeter speakers.\n\n5. Updates are essential\n\nThis one is short and sweet: check for software and firmware updates! (This, by the way, is essential for any device.) Manufacturers often release updates that can improve your soundbar's performance and add new features. Regularly installing updates ensures your soundbar benefits from the latest enhancements and fixes, and squashes bugs that can corrupt sound quality.\n\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has hidden superpowers: 5 benefits you're not taking advantage of\n\nWith these simple tips, you can maximize your soundbar's performance and enjoy a richer, more immersive audio experience. Proper placement, room acoustics optimization, and thoughtfully adjusting your settings will surely elevate your listening experience for streaming. Whether you're watching action-packed blockbusters or rocking out to your favorite tunes, your soundbar will be ready to deliver exceptional audio quality.\n\nLooking for the next best product?

Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Alex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nZDNET's key takeaways\n\nThe Premier League is working with Adobe to exploit generative AI.\n\nExplorations show customers want to create, not just consume content.\n\nLong-term hyper-personalization goals should be approached carefully.\n\nThe English Premier League football season starts this weekend. With 1.8 billion people watching the competition in 900 million homes across 189 countries (streaming on Peacock), it would seem there's limited scope for emerging technology to boost supporter engagement. However, Alexandra Willis, director of digital media at the Premier League, has other ideas.\n\nWillis told ZDNET that while UK-based supporters are the lifeblood of the Premier League, new supporters around the globe have varied demands and requirements. She said the organization's digital transformation strategy focuses on finding ways to serve all football fans.\n\nAlso: What is digital transformation? Everything you need to know about how technology is changing business\n\nAs part of this process, the Premier League uses Adobe technology to create AI-powered digital experiences for supporters worldwide. With the Adobe Experience Platform and the tech firm's AI agents and applications, Willis and her team are consolidating fan preferences and using this data to develop new experiences.\n\n\"The Adobe Experience Platform is giving our team something powerful,\" she said. \"We're going to learn together and work out how we can use the technology to benefit our overall strategy. It's an exciting opportunity because we can do a lot more in the service of our fans.\"\n\nThe Adobe technology suite is the Premier League's first customer data platform. Other business leaders have told ZDNET that solid digital foundations are crucial for any business that wants to engage with customers in an age of AI, and that's also the situation at the Premier League.\n\nAlso: How AI-enabled autonomous business will change the way you work forever\n\nWillis said a new website and app are crucial elements of the Premier League's digital platform strategy. The organization uses Adobe's analytics technology to gain an in-depth understanding of fan preferences across digital channels and its AI models to deliver personalized experiences.\n\nThe Premier League also uses Adobe's AI-powered features, including Generate Video and Clip Maker, to help supporters create content from text-based prompts, and Adobe Firefly, which allows fans to generate content within the organization's fantasy football game.\n\nAlso: 4 questions to ask yourself before betting on AI in your business - and why\n\n\"To be able to develop our digital transformation strategy and then have it come to life, and for it to become real with the launch of the new app and a new website, and to be able to deliver new experiences, is something we're proud of,\" said Willis.\n\nUsing AI to boost Fantasy Premier League\n\nThe start of the English football season marks the beginning of a popular off-field activity: fantasy football. With over 11 million players, Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is the world's biggest and most popular fantasy football game. Willis and her team are eager to use AI to refine the FPL experience.\n\nThat process has already begun. This season, FPL managers can use Adobe's Firefly gen AI technology to create personalized badges and kits for their teams in Adobe Express.\n\nAlso: How AI amplifies these other tech trends that matter most to business in 2025\n\n\"Enabling FPL managers to create assets to show off their team and how they're doing is one aspect of how we're using AI on the creativity side of the business,\" she said.\n\nAlexandra Willis: \"People want to be able to participate in content creation.\" Premier League\n\nWillis said these AI-enabled developments point the way to the future of fan engagement. In an age of gen AI, customers want to create content, not just receive marketing collateral.\n\n\"It's about allowing supporters to utilize Premier League content and imagery, and share the things equally they're excited about, and using Express to sort of remix those things and to put their personal touch on them,\" she said.\n\nWillis is keen to see what content fans will create and suggested that AI is helping to power new ways of engaging with tech-savvy supporters.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see how people behave and how they use the tools,\" she said. \"This initiative is a demonstration of the fact that people want to be able to participate in content creation.\"\n\nAlso: GPT-5 was supposed to simplify ChatGPT but now it has 4 new modes - here's why\n\nOf course, data security and governance are key considerations as the Premier League continues to explore gen AI.\n\nCrucially, given the organization's nascent forays into fan-designed content in FPL, Adobe Firefly is designed to be commercially safe. The technology is trained on a dataset of licensed content, such as Adobe Stock.\n\n\"That feature is incredibly important for us,\" said Willis. \"In general, ensuring that what we're doing is credible and trusted and safe is fundamental, and we've put a lot of effort into delivering on that promise.\"\n\nEvolving and adapting customer personalization\n\nWillis said it's early days for AI-enabled experiences, both generally and within her organization. She said it's important to walk before you run.\n\n\"We're not trying to do too much at the beginning,\" she said. \"We have this passionate fan base. We have around 50 million people in our database, and we want to take the time to discover what they want from us.\"\n\nAlso: How AI agents can generate $450 billion by 2028 - and what stands in the way\n\nWhile other business leaders have told ZDNET about the importance of using emerging technology to hone in on the finer details of customer requirements, Willis suggested it's also important to reflect and refine your approach carefully.\n\n\"Rather than leaping into hyper-personalization right from the very beginning, our strategy is about following the customer's lead and learning from them the things that they want to follow and want to pay attention to, and then seeing how they then behave and react,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm sure some fans might say, 'I'm never going to pay attention to what a certain player does,' and then, suddenly, something that player does is different, they contribute to the supporter's FPL team's performance, and then that fan goes down a rabbit hole of learning more about the individual player. Those are the types of things that we want to learn from and evolve and adapt to as we go.\"\n\nAlso: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction\n\nWillis has refined her leadership approach to digital transformation during her career. Formerly a journalist, she worked for Wimbledon for over a decade, becoming communications and marketing director in August 2021. In September 2022, she moved to the Premier League. She said smart digital leaders are focused on outcomes.\n\n\"Success is about being able to apply the strategic vision of a business and its objectives and to utilize the tools and capabilities that technology provides,\" she said.\n\n\"That process includes working with other colleagues to understand and identify how technology contributes to broader business models. You need to go beyond the narrow field of technology into genuinely delivering against business strategy.\"", "summary": "", "keywords": "[\"uses\", \"boost\", \"fan\", \"league\", \"premier\", \"create\", \"goals\", \"technology\", \"content\", \"score\", \"willis\", \"experiences\", \"adobe\", \"business\", \"digital\", \"ai\"]", "content_hash": "9a855206d9c529c3e0b880d299565716b54f64a7f9eb280948f696a53a35239e", "sentiment": "pending", "fetched_at": "2025-08-15T23:57:55.303436+00:00"}
{"url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-chatgpt-plus-still-worth-20-when-the-free-version-offers-so-much-including-gpt-5/", "title": "Is ChatGPT Plus still worth $20 when the free version offers so much - including GPT-5?", "authors": "[\"Sabrina Ortiz\", \"Senior Editor\", \"Elyse Betters Picaro\", \"Senior Contributing Editor\", \"Aug.\", \"At P.M. Pt\"]", "published": null, "text": "Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET\n\nWhen ChatGPT first launched over two years ago, the AI chatbot was met with such high demand that OpenAI introduced a premium plan called ChatGPT Plus. This plan guaranteed access to the chatbot even during blackout periods. ChatGPT Plus perks also included access to OpenAI's most advanced models, making the $20 plan almost a no-brainer for superusers. However, as OpenAI's offerings have evolved over the past couple of years, so have its plans.\n\nAlso: How ChatGPT could replace the internet as we know it\n\nIf you consider yourself an AI power user or are looking to get the most out of your AI usage, you're likely wondering which ChatGPT tier you should try. In this guide, we'll help you decide whether a free plan, ChatGPT Plus, or a $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro subscription is the best fit for you.\n\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\n\nYou should use ChatGPT Plus if...\n\nChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month. You're probably asking yourself: Why pay when you can use it for free? There are five main advantages, but the TL;DR is that the free tier has heavy usage limits, and the Plus tier gets you the latest features and models first.\n\nIf you only use ChatGPT now and then for fun, it's not worth subscribing. But if you use it for work, writing, creating images, using it as a search engine, or you find yourself opening the app all day, every day, then subscribing is likely a good idea.\n\nElyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET\n\n1. You want access to legacy models\n\nWhen OpenAI launched GPT-5, the company had it replace all of its legacy models in ChatGPT. The model is meant to combine the best of OpenAI's offerings with a smart model for most queries and a deeper reasoning model for harder problems. However, many paying subscribers were upset because they preferred the prior models for their workflows that were already in place.\n\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\n\nSam Altman even acknowledged in an X post that \"suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake.\" As a result, OpenAI brought back the option for ChatGPT Plus users to access legacy models, including: GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-4.1-mini, in addition to GPT-5 (Auto, Fast, Thinking mini, and Thinking).\n\n2. You want to access GPT-5's different modes\n\nWhile GPT-5 combines the best of a deep reasoning model (GPT-5 thinking) and a standard smart model for a balance of speed and quality, users with a Plus subscription can also manually toggle between GPT-5 Thinking, GPT-5 Thinking Mini, and GPT-5 Fast.\n\nAlso: GPT-5 bombed my coding tests, but redeemed itself with code analysis\n\nThe benefit: Users can choose to use a reasoning model when they think it would be the best fit instead of having the real router feature automatically understand which model to use based on the conversation, the complexity of the prompt, and more, which is still available with the GPT-5 Auto option. If you often work on harder problems that require the model to think more to output the best possible answer, then having the option to toggle on GPT-5 Thinking could be a compelling reason to subscribe.\n\n3. You want to access Sora\n\nOpenAI's Sora video-generating model allows users to create stunning, realistic videos from text prompts or their own assets with up to 1080p resolution. Videos can be up to 20 seconds long, with a limit of 10 seconds for ChatGPT Plus users, and can be widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. Whether you have a real workflow reason for AI-generated content or just want to tinker, it is a fun model to use.\n\nTo create images, ChatGPT also uses the GPT-4o image generator, OpenAI's most capable image generator to date.\n\nWith it, you can simply ask \"create an image of…,\" describe a scene, and receive an AI-generated image that can include realistic human generations and even text. You can also upload an existing image and describe edits for GPT-4o to apply -- like adding text, refining details, or changing backgrounds. Just be aware that complex requests may take a couple of minutes.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT's new image generator shattered my expectations - and now it's free to try\n\nUsage is capped for free users, but Plus and Pro subscribers can enjoy much higher daily quotas.\n\nOpenAI said free-tier users can use GPT-4o only a limited number of times within a five-hour window. It will notify you once you've reached the limit and invite you to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus. If you're on the Free tier and rely heavily on image creation, you might see a message like: \"You've reached your image creation limit. Upgrade to ChatGPT Plus or try again tomorrow...\"\n\nSo, if you often use AI for visual assets, such as videos or images, ChatGPT Plus is an easy choice.\n\n4. You want to use the Codex AI coding agent\n\nOpenAI recently integrated its powerful Codex AI coding agent into ChatGPT Plus, so now anyone with the $20-a-month Plus can get AI-powered coding suggestions without shelling out $200. You can point it at your GitHub repo, and it'll whip up code changes, run checks to make sure nothing's broken, and even handle installing dependencies online if you let it. Just keep in mind it doesn't \"remember\" anything between sessions, so you have to give it clear instructions every time.\n\nAlso: You can use OpenAI's super powerful AI coding agent Codex for just $20 now\n\nAlso, since the coding agent is new to ChatGPT, you might encounter some speed bumps if many people are using it at once.\n\n5. You want expanded access to ChatGPT's best features\n\nYou're probably noticing a theme here: The majority of ChatGPT's most advanced features are eventually made available to free users, but with heavy usage limitations. Therefore, the main benefit of upgrading is getting to use features like Deep Research, Advanced Voice Mode, and GPT-4o image generation a lot more frequently than you could on the free tier. Subscribing to ChatGPT Plus also gives you priority access to OpenAI's latest models and newest tools well before they reach the free tier.\n\nWith a Plus account, you can access extended limits on:\n\nmessaging\n\nfile uploads\n\nimage creation\n\ndata analysis\n\nDeep Research\n\nAgent Mode\n\nGPT-4 image generation\n\nmemory and context\n\nIf you don't want to miss out on the latest ChatGPT features and models, you should subscribe to the Plus tier.\n\nYou should use ChatGPT Pro if...\n\nOK, so now that we've discussed why Plus is worth it, let's look at the more expensive Pro plan that costs $200 a month. Most people would never pay a car payment's worth of money to use AI, but there are special instances in which it could be worth it.\n\nElyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET\n\n1. You want what ChatGPT Plus has on a greater scale\n\nAll ChatGPT Plus perks and features are included in ChatGPT Pro, but with far fewer usage constraints. Pro also adds several exclusive capabilities. Here's a rundown of the biggest benefits, should you be seriously considering the upgrade.\n\nUnlimited access to all reasoning models: This includes GPT-5 with pro reasoning, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 (and its mini variant), o3, o3-pro, o4-mini, and GPT-4.5 (research preview).\n\nThis includes GPT-5 with pro reasoning, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 (and its mini variant), o3, o3-pro, o4-mini, and GPT-4.5 (research preview).

Maximum Deep Research, memory, and context, Agent Mode\n\nPriority access to Sora video generation: You get up to 1080p video generation, 20-second videos, five concurrent generations, and watermark-free downloads.\n\nYou get up to 1080p video generation, 20-second videos, five concurrent generations, and watermark-free downloads. Higher access to the Codex agent, projects, tasks, and custom GPTs.\n\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT: A beginner's guide to the most popular AI chatbot\n\nAs you can see, Pro offers more features and higher limits than the Plus tier. Pro users reportedly rarely encounter any constraints and can truly leverage the full power of ChatGPT and its newest tools.\n\n2. You want access to OpenAI's most powerful models\n\nAs mentioned in the No. 1 selling point of ChatGPT Plus, there are many perks to being able to access the older models, including sticking to what you were already using in your workflow and what you are accustomed to. In addition to all of the legacy models accessible in the Plus tier, with the Pro subscription, you can also access GPT-5 Pro, the most capable version of the model aimed toward complex tasks, and the Thinking 4.5 (research previews), which is only available to Pro users because \"it costs a lot of GPUs,\" according to Altman.\n\nYou should use free ChatGPT if...\n\nFinally, let's look at the free version of ChatGPT. I discussed most of its features above, so in this section, I'll break down what advantages it can offer over the paid plans. It essentially comes down to how often you use ChatGPT and whether having access to the latest and greatest features matters to you. If you don't use it much and don't care, the free version is 100% the way to go.\n\nElyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET\n\n1. You don't want to pay a monthly fee\n\nThe free subscription now offers many competitive AI features, reducing the need for a Plus subscription, especially for tools that were once paywalled. Free ChatGPT users can access:\n\nGPT-5\n\nChatGPT Search (web browsing for timely information and sources)\n\nImage Generation via GPT-4o (daily limit applies)\n\nDeep Research (up to five \"lightweight\" tasks per month)\n\nChatGPT Voice (free monthly preview)\n\nFile and Photo Uploads for in-chat discussions (limited usage)\n\nMemory Feature for referencing recent conversations (lightweight version)\n\nIf you only need occasional AI assistance -- and do not mind daily usage caps -- the free tier should serve you well. It's surprisingly robust and now includes many advanced features that were once behind a paywall. For instance, when OpenAI launched GPT-5, it also became available for free users.\n\n2. You're a casual ChatGPT user\n\nIf you rarely hit the daily usage limits for text, voice, or image generation, upgrading to Plus or Pro might not be necessary.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT can record, transcribe, and analyze your meetings now\n\nThe free version offers enough headroom for light interactions -- asking a few questions per day, generating a handful of images, briefly exploring advanced data analysis, and more. However, if you often see messages about hitting your limits (for text, voice, images, etc.), it might be time to consider paying for a subscription. For superusers who need top-tier capacity and extended access to advanced features, there's ChatGPT Pro, but Plus is a more affordable middle ground.\n\nUltimately, if your needs are minimal and limitations don't bother you, sticking with the free tier is perfectly fine.\n\nFAQs How much do ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro cost? As of August 2025, here are the ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro pricing tiers and how they differ, as displayed by OpenAI on its website: Screenshot by Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET Does the Pro tier include everything you get with Plus? Yes, Pro contains everything in Plus. That means unlimited or higher limits on certain features and exclusive access to GPT-5 Pro and Research preview of new features. Do ChatGPT Pro users experience downtime or blackout periods? Pro subscribers have the highest priority for uptime, making downtime extremely rare. However, no tier can guarantee 100% uptime if OpenAI undergoes major outages or scheduled maintenance. If you upgrade to Plus, can you later switch to Pro? You can upgrade from Plus to Pro at any time through your account settings. Your billing date may adjust based on when you switch. How to get early access to new ChatGPT features on the free tier Unfortunately, free users typically must wait until OpenAI rolls them out publicly. Plus and Pro subscribers receive early or exclusive testing opportunities before features reach the free plan.
