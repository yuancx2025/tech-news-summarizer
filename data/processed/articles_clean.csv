For scientists, that has long posed a problem: According to physicists’ best current theories, matter and its counterpart, antimatter, ought to have been created in equal amounts at the time of the Big Bang. But antimatter is vanishingly rare in the universe. So what happened?

Physicists don’t know the answer to that question yet, but many think the solution must involve some subtle difference in the way that matter and antimatter behave. And right now, the most promising path into that unexplored territory centers on new experiments involving the mysterious subatomic particle known as the neutrino.

“It’s not to say that neutrinos are definitely the explanation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry, but a very large class of models that can explain this asymmetry are connected to neutrinos,” says Jessica Turner, a theoretical physicist at Durham University in the United Kingdom.

Let’s back up for a moment: When physicists talk about matter, that’s just the ordinary stuff that the universe is made of—mainly protons and neutrons (which make up the nuclei of atoms), along with lighter particles like electrons. Although the term “antimatter” has a sci-fi ring to it, antimatter is not all that different from ordinary matter. Typically, the only difference is electric charge: For example, the positron—the first antimatter particle to be discovered—matches an electron in its mass but carries a positive rather than a negative charge. (Things are a bit more complicated with electrically neutral particles. For example, a photon is considered to be its own antiparticle, but an antineutron is distinct from a neutron in that it’s made up of antiquarks rather than ordinary quarks.)",,,"matter, physicists, mysterious, antimatter, particles, example, neutrinos, universes, explain, particle, difference, missing, ordinary, universe",pending,2025-08-16T13:30:22.897996+00:00,0392a5026b220b42ed7363de816b39980860e5aab6ecbe2fd13b1886154d9bcf

Diplomats from around the world concluded nine days of talks in Geneva—plus a marathon overnight session that lasted into the early hours of Friday—with no agreement on a global plastics treaty.

During a closing plenary that started on Friday at 6:30 am, more than 15 hours after it was originally scheduled to begin, nearly all countries opposed an updated draft of the United Nations treaty that was put forward by the negotiating committee chair, the Ecuadorian diplomat Luis Vayas Valdivieso. Many of their delegates said the text did not reflect their mandate under a UN Environment Assembly resolution to “end plastic pollution” by addressing the “full life cycle” of plastics.

“We are truly sad to say that we will not have a treaty to end plastic pollution here in Geneva,” the head negotiator for Norway, Andreas Bjelland Erikse, told the chair. Valdivieso wrapped up the meeting just after 9 am with the promise that they would continue at a later date.

The decision ends a contentious week and a half of discussions during the “resumed” fifth session of negotiations over a United Nations plastics treaty, which started in Geneva on August 4. Delegates had arrived in the city hoping to finalize a treaty by Thursday, having already overrun their original deadline to complete the agreement by the end of 2024.

Signs of a logjam were apparent even within the first few days of the talks, however, as countries hewed to the same red lines they’d stuck to during previous negotiations. A so-called “like-minded group” of oil-producing countries said it would not accept legally binding obligations and opposed a wide range of provisions that other nations said were essential, including controls on new plastic production, as well as mandatory disclosures and phaseouts of hazardous chemicals used in plastics.

During a plenary on August 9, three observers independently told Grist that the negotiations felt like Groundhog Day, as countries reiterated familiar talking points. A norm around consensus-based decisionmaking discouraged compromise from all countries, though the like-minded group—which includes Bahrain, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, among other countries—was particularly intransigent and understood it could simply block proposals rather than shift its positions. Instead of whittling down a draft of the treaty that had been prepared late last year during the previous meeting in Busan, South Korea, delegates added hundreds of suggestions to it, placing a deal further from reach.

Over the course of the Geneva talks, delegates rejected two new drafts of the treaty prepared by Valdivieso: one released on Wednesday, which was so objectionable that countries said it was “repulsive” and lacked “any demonstrable value,” and the most recent one published just hours before Friday’s 6:30 am plenary. Many expressed their preference to revert back to the Busan draft as a basis for future discussions.",,"Joseph Winters, Fernanda González, Antonio Dini, Andrea J.

413,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-finally-destroyed-steve-jobss-vision-of-the-ipad-good/,Apple Finally Destroyed Steve Jobs’ Vision of the iPad. Good,2025-08-16T11:00:00+00:00,"For years, Apple treated the idea of windows on the iPad as sacrilege. But with iPadOS 26 installed, today’s iPads are doing macOS cosplay, becoming touchscreen Macs in all but name. And here’s the thing: It’s actually pretty good. So how did we get here? When did this fundamental shift occur that killed off Steve Jobs’ vision of the iPad?

When Jobs first revealed the iPad in 2010, it was pitched as a “third category” of device—something between a phone and a laptop. For that category to justify its existence, Jobs said it had to be better at certain key tasks. He duly listed browsing the web, dealing with email, watching videos, listening to music, playing games, reading ebooks, and enjoying photos. Coincidentally, those were the exact things the iPad was really good at.

Playing up the distinct nature of a tablet experience, the original demo found Jobs using his iPad not at a desk but while relaxing in a chair. “Using this thing is remarkable,” he said of the iPad. “It’s so much more intimate than a laptop, and so much more capable than a smartphone with its gorgeous large display. Holding the internet in your hands is an incredible experience.” Assuming, of course, you didn’t want to do much more than read.

This, then, was a device that was focused. Elegant. Simple. Better than a phone or a laptop for lean-back media consumption. But even during that demo, there were hints of the tension that was to come.

A Brush With the Future

Brushes creator Steve Sprang appeared on stage and suggested the iPad could move beyond the consumption-first narrative: “Artists have already done amazing things with the iPhone, and I think with this larger screen they’re going to have a true portable paint studio.” And Apple itself introduced touch-optimized—if noticeably simplified—versions of its iWork office suite.

The problems came when you started using these apps. Sprang’s was fun. It looked gorgeous. The bigger canvas offered room to play. But artists were pining for input options beyond their own digits. That didn’t align with Jobs’ scornful comment about other tablet makers: “If you see a stylus, they blew it.”

And iWork? You could quickly sketch out the bones of a document or presentation while sitting on the sofa, then send it to your Mac to finish. But trying to be meaningfully productive solely on the iPad was a chore. In attempting to simplify computing and pare things back, Apple had cut things to the bone. Interaction was opinionated to a fault. And the lack of a system-wide file manager—a Finder for iPad—meant files were siloed in apps, duplicated as you moved between them, and impossible to track.

Perhaps Apple underestimated how quickly users would demand more from the iPad than basic tasks and media consumption, or how frustrating it would be to not have access to computing norms like traditional multitasking or a file system exposed to the user. Apple soon found out. The iPad sold incredibly well—at first. But its position between two existing extremes began to unravel. Not to the point it became a flop. But the initial meteoric sales trajectory plateaued and went into decline. As Apple scrambled, experimenting to boost flagging sales, the focused iPad vision started to fade.

Apple’s Awkward Middle Child

The problem was that the iPad sat between two existing critical device categories but couldn’t replace either of them. Smartphones were becoming indispensable. The iPad? A nice-to-have. And Apple’s laudable build quality meant iPads lasted for years. Most people rarely felt compelled to upgrade, because their first iPad still did everything they needed it to, which often wasn’t much.

But a noisy cohort—people who wanted to work on an iPad and who might favor a tablet over a laptop—grew frustrated. The iPad gained a reputation. It was sometimes great for doing one thing at a time. Useful when you wanted to focus. But when you needed more, it all fell apart.",,"Craig Grannell, Luke Larsen, Julian Chokkattu, Justin Pot, David Nield, Brad Bourque, Matt Kamen, Will Knight, Kristin Canning","apple, laptop, wanted, ipad, thing, finally, destroyed, using, good, vision, steve, jobs, tablet, things",pending,2025-08-16T13:28:58.498410+00:00,7d7b38f3c4eff0f227eb891685c2b38f83a5423ef873fb399625d52fecac15dc

Except it's not new. Unplugged has been around for a few years—the company was cofounded by Erik Prince, the founder of private military company Blackwater—and it originally announced the Up Phone in 2023. But this week, the company claims it's “relaunching” the phone, under new leadership.

Like the original, the Up Phone's UnpluggedOS (formerly LibertOS) is built on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and isn't connected to Google Mobile Services, which it claims prevents “backdoor data collection.” Unplugged's focus is on limiting who gets access to your data. There's an on-device Firewall app that blocks third-party trackers and a built-in “no logs” VPN. A kill switch separates the battery and cuts power to other circuits when the phone is turned off, and you'll find the Brave browser preinstalled.

Unfortunately, many of the company's early privacy claims were far-fetched, and it doesn't help that it was denounced by established player GrapheneOS in 2024. It's hard to take its renewed privacy claims seriously.

Worse yet, the specs haven't changed since its 2023 debut. That includes a MediaTek Dimensity 1200, a processor from 2021, and a paltry 8 GB of RAM. Also, considering the eye-watering $989 price, it doesn't match the specs you'll find on comparable phones.

More strangely, Unplugged claims it plans to bring manufacturing to the US later in 2025, “creating jobs domestically.” (The Up Phone is currently made in Indonesia.) This rhetoric is reminiscent of the Trump Mobile T1 Phone, which initially claimed would be made in the US, but later backtracked on that promise. Manufacturing the Up Phone in the US would likely skyrocket its already high price.

Don't forget that the privacy services are only free for the first year. After that you'll have to pay $13 per month or $130 per year to access them. The Up Phone ships in September and is available for purchase from Best Buy and Unplugged, but we don't recommend you snag one anytime soon.

The report prompted US senator Maggie Hassan to demand accountability from the companies. WIRED also took a deep dive looking at what the data-analysis giant Palantir actually does.

Reports this week that Russia was likely involved in, or entirely behind, the US Courts records system breach highlight both the stakes of the incident and information that federal investigators seem to still be lacking about what exactly happened.

Russia started blocking WhatsApp and Telegram calls this week, saying that the encryption schemes the communication platforms use to protect customer calls from interception violate information-sharing requirements between tech companies and the government. The platforms have close to 100 million users each in Russia, according to Al Jazeera and Mediascope. The Kremlin has spent years expanding its mechanisms for internet censorship and control, often under the guise of national security and law enforcement.

A WhatsApp spokesperson told WIRED in a statement that “WhatsApp is private, end-to-end encrypted, and defies government attempts to violate people’s right to secure communication, which is why Russia is trying to block it from over 100 million Russian people.”

Reuters reports that Telegram told Russia's RBC Daily that it takes steps to address criminal behavior on its platform, including deploying moderators equipped with AI tools to monitor public discourse and communications on the platform that are not end-to-end encrypted. Telegram said it takes down millions of malicious messages each day.

ICE agents inadvertently added a random person to a group chat named “Mass Text,” exposing sensitive discussions including details about a manhunt for a convicted attempted murderer who apparently had been flagged for deportation. The person who was added to the group chat “is not a law enforcement official or associated with the investigation in any way,” according to 404 Media, and “initially thought it was a series of spam messages” after being added to the chat weeks ago.

Messages reportedly included the ICE Field Operations Worksheet for the case, which contains detailed information about the target, as well as communications in which ICE agents appeared to be accessing data from a DMV and license plate readers. The breach is reminiscent of so-called SignalGate, another recent situation in which senior Trump administration cabinet members accidentally included the editor in chief of The Atlantic in a Signal group chat created to plan US air strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen.

The head of Norway's security police service, Beate Gangås, said this week that it was Russian hackers who targeted a dam in Norway in April and released millions of gallons of water during the four hours that they had control. The Russian embassy denied the allegations in comments to Reuters. Gangås accused Russia of perpetrating the hack in a speech on Thursday, according to Norwegian media.

Police in England will have more access to facial recognition tools. Ministers announced this week that law enforcement will deploy 10 live facial recognition vans around the country that will be used by seven police forces to aid in investigations related to “sex offenders or people wanted for the most serious crimes,” according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. Police have increasingly turned to facial recognition in the United Kingdom in recent years, but the vans will represent an additional expansion in England.",,"Lily Hay Newman, Dell Cameron, Matt Burgess, Andy Greenberg, Vittoria Elliott, Kim Zetter, Caroline Haskins","according, encrypted, chat, russian, cracking, endtoend, week, wired, calls, tools, whatsapp, security, telegram, russia",pending,2025-08-16T13:29:13.608271+00:00,80befe0d741bd4ebf29499b067fcb89fbe0c81d3e54304573e3372c2f5f00db7

The MacBook Air M4 (2025) is a rock-solid MacBook for college students. It's our favorite laptop overall and the Best MacBook you can buy, and it gets you excellent value for the money. It strikes a fantastic balance between performance and price, and it'll have no trouble handling multiple browser tabs or lasting you all day. It has support for external displays and Apple Intelligence, a high-resolution 12-MP webcam, and a thin form factor that won't bother your back while you're toting it around.

The Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook Plus is a very good Chromebook for students, especially if you need a solid laptop and your budget is tight. The 2-in-1 design can be used in laptop mode or tablet mode, and while the battery life could be better, the performance is smooth. It's hard to find more laptop for the price.

The Apple iPad (2025, A16) sells for this price pretty frequently, but it does jump back up to its MSRP of $350 regularly and rarely falls much below $300. It's the best iPad for most people, and it's a solid contender if you want some of the capabilities of doing basic schoolwork without a traditional laptop. It's compatible with the first-generation Apple Pencil, the USB-C Apple Pencil, the Smart Folio, and the Magic Keyboard Folio. We have more recommendations in our iPad Accessories Buying Guide.

The OnePlus 13 came out earlier this year, and this is the best price drop we've seen for it so far. It's a great Android phone, especially if you care a lot about the battery: Not only does it last up to two days, depending on what you're doing, but it can also be charged from zero to 100 in just over 30 minutes. Battery aside, the rest of the phone is good, too: Snappy performance, water resistance, and a slick triple-lens camera. If you order from OnePlus directly, you'll get a free phone case or pair of earbuds. It's a very solid deal if you want to upgrade your phone for the new school year.

This is a great deal on the best high-capacity USB-A flash drive, and if you need more space for some reason, the 2-terabyte version is also discounted. It has zippy speeds, a three-year warranty, and enough space to store console games or 4K movies. (Or, you know, many school papers.)

This is the best budget gaming monitor. (We also quite like the AOC QD-OLED Monitor (Q27G4ZD) but it is not currently on sale.) The price has only dropped by $20, but this is a match of the lowest it tends to drop outside of events like Black Friday, and just $20 above the lowest price we've seen. It's not 4K, but you'll get a 180-Hz refresh rate with this 27-inch 1440p screen. It has adaptive sync for smooth gameplay, and it'll be a noticeable upgrade if you're using a 1080p monitor. If you want to spend some time gaming between Zoom calls or homework, and your monitor needs an upgrade, this is a safe bet.

If you don't need Dolby Vision support, then this is the Roku you want. It's the best streaming stick for most people. The Roku Streaming Stick Plus (2025) is a 4K and HDR-friendly streaming stick with a voice remote and a small footprint. It's very similar to the stick we recommend below—it just doesn't have Dolby Vision, and it has shorter Wi-Fi range, which shouldn't be a problem if your dorm is small.

This is the best Roku overall. It supports 4K streaming and Dolby Vision, and it comes with a voice remote. It'll plug directly into the back of your TV. Roku's interface is slick and easy to use, and there are even free live TV shows so you can watch Antiques Roadshow or How It's Made. If you've been using your parents' streaming stick and you're off to college, this is an option worth considering.

When these fantastic workout headphones aren't selling for $250, they're selling for $200. It's very rare to find a better discount, and even then, it's usually minimal. The Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 Earbuds are aesthetically pleasing, with popping colors like purple and orange available. They're comfortable to wear, with good sound and noise cancelation. They have on-board controls. They play well with Android and iOS devices. And the wireless charging case can top them up when the 10-hour battery life runs out. It's hard to find a better pair of workout-friendly earbuds, and they're a great choice for student athletes who want to zone out at the gym.

This Bluetooth speaker has a built-in carabiner that can be attached to your backpack, bike handlebars, or belt loop. We like the durable water- and dust-resistant body, and it has surprisingly good sound for a speaker as small as it is. It's not perfect for parties, but it is a solid pick if you want on-the-go sound for your bicycle commute or your after-school workouts.

The Apple Watch Series 10 is the best smartwatch for iPhone owners, and it's also an excellent fitness tracker. If you don't already have a smartwatch, you might be surprised at all the little ways it can improve your life. From at-a-glance notifications to workout and sleep tracking to emergency SOS alerts in case of an accident, these wrist gadgets are worth considering for going off to college or leading a class full of students. For an Android alternative, we like the Google Pixel 3 on sale for $318 ($82 off), but a new watch is coming later this month, so you might want to wait.

If your kiddos are going to be using laptops or tablets for school this year, they might need a pair of headphones. These are great kid-safe headphones that offer noise cancellation to help keep them focused, with volume limited to 85 decibels to help protect little ears. They're comfortable to wear and can be used wirelessly or with the included 3.5-mm audio cable.

This is the best power bank for those who want more than the basics. Its 25,000-mAh capacity and up to 165-watt delivery are more than enough for your phone, tablet, and laptop, and the power bank itself recharges quickly as well. It also has a handy display for at-a-glance information, and built-in USB-C cables that'll come in handy in a pinch.

It’s also, oddly enough, a good time to experiment with the plug.

The Donald Trump administration put the kibosh on several US federal policies aimed at boosting the development, production, and purchase of new-energy vehicles. Still, $4,000 tax credits for used battery-electric cars and plug-in hybrids are available for qualified vehicles and buyers (more on that later) until the end of September.

If you want to take advantage of this incentive, you should know that used plug-in hybrids, or PHEVs, are unique beasts. They’re complicated vehicles, engineering-wise, containing both internal combustion engines and electric motors, and using two power sources—electricity and gasoline—to go. There’s also a bunch of variation in the plug-in hybrid world. So there are tricks to picking out the best used one. WIRED asked car experts what to think about if you’re going after a used PHEV.

Shopping for a full electric? Check out our guide to buying the best used EV.

Know Your Terms

If you’re after a plug-in hybrid, make sure first that you're getting the right sort of technology. Plain, old hybrid vehicles, sometimes called HEVs, also come with gas engines plus electric motors. But plug-in hybrids come with bigger electric batteries that can be plugged in and charged. Generally, that means that PHEVs drive on electricity until their batteries are depleted, at which point the gas engine kicks in.

Though PHEVs by definition go both ways, some are more battery-powered than others. First, older PHEV models have very limited electric ranges. Those made before 2019 tend to get less than 17 miles of range per charge, and some closer to 10 miles. Also, some plug-ins are more “gas-biased” than others, which matters if your goal is to save on fueling. The Ford Escape PHEVs’ gas engine comes on when you accelerate or turn on the air-conditioning. The Kia Sorento’s heat system is powered by gas. Other models tend to tap into gas when they’re hauling heavier loads. These biases can change between model years. Investigate the details of your specific used PHEV before deciding on a purchase.

As opposed to full battery-electric cars, PHEVs can’t charge at “fast chargers,” the sort you’ll often find off highways, which can top up a car in around 30 minutes. Instead, PHEVs rely on standard 120-volt wall outlets, which can usually charge up a plug-in hybrid’s electric battery overnight, or faster “level 2” charging.

Know Your Life

Picking a used PHEV—or knowing if a used PHEV is for you, period—will require thinking about whether one can fit into your life. Lots of people think of plug-ins as EV-lites, a gateway drug to the battery-powered car. But that’s not quite right, says Joseph Yoon, the head of consumer insights at Edmunds. Those who want to save money on gas need to make sure that their daily driving is covered by the PHEV’s limited battery range, and that they have the ability to charge their car overnight at home, he says. If drivers can’t meet those conditions, “I don’t think plug-in hybrids are as practical as people think they are.”

In fact, PHEVs tend to be less gas-efficient than even some of their hybrid gas-powered counterparts. So if you’re not able to charge one overnight regularly, it might actually cost you more to fuel.

421,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/wikipedia-editor-largest-self-promotion-operation/,How One Wikipedia Editor Unraveled the ‘Single Largest Self-Promotion Operation’ in the Site's History,2025-08-16T09:00:00+00:00,"Quick—what are the top entries in the category ""Wikipedia articles written in the greatest number of languages""?

The answer is countries.

Turkey tops the list with Wikipedia entries in 332 different languages, while the US is second with 327 and Japan is third with 324. Other common words make their appearance as one looks down the list. ""Dog"" (275 languages) tops ""cat"" (273). Jesus (274) beats ""Adolf Hitler"" (242). And all of them beat ""sex"" (122), which is also bested by ""fever,"" ""Chiang Kai-Shek,"" and the number ""13.""

But if you had looked at the list a couple months back, something would have been different. Turkey, the US, and Japan were still in the same order near the top of the leaderboard, but the number one slot was occupied by an unlikely contender: David Woodard, who had Wikipedia entries in 335 different languages.

You ... haven't heard of David Woodard?

Woodard is a composer who infamously wrote a ""prequiem""—that is, a ""pre requiem""—in 2001 for Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, who had murdered 168 people with a truck bomb. The piece was to be performed at a church near McVeigh's execution site in Terre Haute, Indiana, then recorded and played on the radio so that McVeigh would have a chance to hear it.

According to the LA Times, which spoke to the composer, ""Woodard’s hope in performing the 12-minute piece, he said, is to 'cause the soul of Timothy McVeigh to go to heaven.'"" According to BBC coverage from the time, Woodard ""says McVeigh is '33 and nearly universally despised at the time of his execution'—like Jesus Christ.""

Hoo boy.

Woodard also had a scheme to help save Nueva Germania, an 1880s colony in Paraguay that was designed to let German culture flourish away from the influence of European Jews. Friedrich Nietzsche's sister, Elisabeth, was one of the founding colonists. Elisabeth's husband killed himself as the colony collapsed; she returned to Europe. (Lest you subscribe to the common view that Nietzsche was himself some kind of crude racist, know that he loathed his brother-in-law's racism and cut ties with his sister when she left Europe. Unfortunately, due to his later madness, he eventually ended up under her care for several years, and she edited his works after his death in ways that made him look more like a proto-Nazi.) Some descendants of the colonists still live at Nueva Germania, but the colony is now poor and run-down, and Elisabeth's house is almost gone.

""As an artist who is fed up with much of the pretentious nonsense that has come to define Western culture,"" Woodard told SF Gate, ""I am drawn to the idea of an Aryan vacuum in the middle of the jungle.""

So what was a guy like this doing with articles in 335 different languages?

また、VTuberファンは「気に入ったものには惜しみなくお金を使う」ことで知られている。例えば、ライブ会場で販売されていたライトスティックは1本およそ60ドルもするが、多くのファンは2本セットで購入する。なぜなら、ステージに推しが登場した瞬間、左右の手で一斉にペンライトを振り、同じ“深紅”の光で会場を染めたいからだ。ただ持参するだけでは不十分。公式のペンライトでなければならないという、共有された感覚がある。

こうした情熱を、音楽の純粋主義者は、「音楽が本当に好きなんじゃなくて、アニメが好きなだけだ」、「これはリアルじゃない、全部まやかしだ」と笑うかもしれない。正直なところ、わたしも最初はそう思っていた。だが、ライブが進むにつれて、その考えは揺らいでいった。次第にわたしは、ある種の“存在論的な危機”に直面した。自分の“本物の音楽”の定義は、いったい何を根拠にしているのだろう？

ヒップホップは資本主義的なジャンルでありながら、“リアル”であることに執着している。しかし、実際のところその「リアル」も、いつも曖昧だ。リック・ロスは本物の麻薬ディーラーの名前を借りているが、過去に矯正施設の職員だったことを隠そうとした。ドレイクは「底辺から這い上がった」(“Started from the bottom”)と歌いながら、実際には若くしてテレビに出演していた。そして、リル・テッカはブレイク曲「Ransom」の内容がほとんどフィクションであることを、カメラの前で笑いながら認めた。でも、それでいいじゃないか。曲が良ければ、それで十分だ。

パンクだって、フォークだって、わたしたちは「本物らしさ」をめぐって、アーティストやファン同士で試し合ってきた。だが、心の底ではみんな知っている──わたしたちが信じている「リアル」は、共同でつくり上げた虚構にすぎない。

VTuber文化は、その“ごっこ遊び”を最初から堂々と楽しんでいるだけだ。むしろ一番素直で、肩肘を張らずに没入しているかもしれない。

そもそも一番すごいのは「Fantastic Reality」が実現したこと自体かもしれない。Mariyaが語ってくれたことによると、彼女は「ショーをやりたい」と思い立ち、自分が好きなVTuberたちに片っ端から声をかけて出演をお願いしたという。

彼女は観客のことをよく理解している。このジャンルにハマっている人なら、日本のスタジアムを埋めるほどの人気を誇るKAFや、インドネシアのバーチャルガールグループJKT48Vといったアーティストがラインナップにいるだけで、チケットを買う理由になるとわかっているようだ。Mariya自身にも大きなファンベースがあるが、彼女がブッキングできたなかでも特に注目すべき名前には及ばない。それがIronmouse（アイアンマウス）だ。彼女はかつて、TwitchでKai Cenatの有料サブスクライバー数記録を破ったことがある。

「これは単に賢さの問題ではありません。心理的なニュアンスを理解し、人々を尊重しながら依存させない方法で支援することが重要なのです」と、MITラボの研究員パット・パタラヌタポーンは語る。

OpenAIも“感情知能”に着手

OpenAIもすでにこうした課題を明確に意識している。先週、同社は将来的にモデルを最適化し、精神的または感情的な苦痛の兆候を検出して適切に対応できるようにしたいと説明するブログを公開した。

OpenAIのGPT-5のモデルカードには、同社が心理的知能のための独自ベンチマークを開発していることが記されている。

「GPT-5モデルはポストトレーニングによってイエスマン的傾向を弱めています。また、感情的依存や、そのほかの精神的・感情的苦痛を伴う可能性のある状況といった関連分野についても積極的に研究を進めています」と記されている。「これらの領域でモデルをより安全にするために活用できる、信頼性の高いベンチマークを設定・共有できるよう、評価手法の成熟化に取り組んでいます」

GPT-5が一部のユーザーにとって期待外れに映る理由のひとつは、AIがまだ習得できていない「健全な関係を維持する能力」という、人間に特有の知能の側面を浮き彫りにしているからかもしれない。人間は相手によって接し方を変える術に長けているが、ChatGPTにとって、これはまだ身につけるべきスキルである。

「現在のGPT-5の人格は今後、GPT-4oほど（多くのユーザーにとって）鬱陶しくなく、いまより温かみを感じられる方向にアップデートする予定です」とサム・アルトマンは昨日、Xで投稿した。「過去数日で学んだことのひとつは、モデルの人格をもっとユーザーごとにカスタマイズできる世界に早く到達する必要がある、ということです」

Engineers completed a final test of Starship's propulsion system with a so-called ""spin prime"" test Wednesday at the launch site in South Texas. Ground crews then rolled the ship back to a nearby hangar for engine inspections, touchups to its heat shield, and a handful of other chores to ready it for liftoff.

SpaceX has announced the launch is scheduled for no earlier than next Sunday, August 24, at 6:30 pm local time in Texas (23:30 UTC).

Like all previous Starship launches, the huge 403-foot-tall (123-meter) rocket will take off from SpaceX's test site in Starbase, Texas, just north of the US-Mexico border. The rocket consists of a powerful booster stage named Super Heavy, with 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines. Six Raptors power the upper stage, known simply as Starship.

With this flight, SpaceX officials hope to put several technical problems with the Starship program behind them. SpaceX is riding a streak of four disappointing Starship test flights from January through May, and and the explosion and destruction of another Starship vehicle during a ground test in June.

These setbacks followed a highly successful year for the world's largest rocket in 2024, when SpaceX flew Starship four times and achieved new objectives on each flight. These accomplishments included the first catch of a Super Heavy booster back at the launch pad, proving the company's novel concept for recovering and reusing the rocket's first stage.

Starship's record so far in 2025 is another story. The rocket's inability to make it through an entire suborbital test flight has pushed back future program milestones, such as the challenging tasks of recovering and reusing the rocket's upper stage, and demonstrating the ability to refuel another rocket in orbit. Those would both be firsts in the history of spaceflight.",,,"starships, flight, upper, launch, reveals, failed, rockets, texas, spacex, draws, test, starship, near, rocket, stage",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:37.095453+00:00,49cc2fbc0a010266b2ccd2f6fcfb568de15106b52f7c8ef77d1086554130c007

Lauren Goode: It seems like secrecy is also embedded in the origins of the company. One of its early investors was in QTEL, which is the CIA's venture capital arm. And two of Palantir's cofounders are pretty well-known. Peter Thiel, we've talked about a few times on this show, and Alex Karp, seem like they have intentionally wanted to position the company as a government and military partner, which, like we said earlier, inevitably comes with some secrecy.

Michael Calore: We need to take a break now, but when we come back, we're going to dive further into those founders that you just talked about, Lauren, and we're going to break down how their vision of a techno state has shaped the company, and what it can mean for our collective future.

Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. Before the break, WIRED's Caroline Haskins was telling us all about Palantir services, and how the company actually works with data and the software that it sells to organizations. But it's through looking at two of Palantir's cofounders, particularly Peter Thiel and Alex Karp, that the company's identity starts to come into sharper focus.

Peter Thiel almost needs no introduction. We've talked about him on the show before. And besides being one of the cofounders of Palantir, he used to be part of the so-called PayPal Mafia, and has gathered widespread attention for his support of the current administration and other GOP candidates. Alex Karp is the current CEO of Palantir, and he co-founded the company alongside Thiel and a few other people in 2003. So from the start, what vision did they set up for the company?

Caroline Haskins: I feel like maybe a useful way into that is to talk about some of the internal jargon that Palantir uses. I mean, even just externally, the name Palantir actually comes from Lord of the Rings. It's this idea of an all-seeing stone that can look across vast expanses of land in the present, or go into the past. So the whole idea of that is to provide a product to that is seemingly extremely powerful and can go wherever you would need it to go. But then I guess internally, I think employees have really adopted this attitude that they are solving the world's most difficult problems and making the world a better place.

So, they've kept with the Lord of the Rings language, even just talking amongst each other. Employees call themselves internally, since really the early days of the company, they've called each other hobbits. To the best of my knowledge. I'm not sure how popular this phrase is these days, but a motto that was circulated internally was Save the Shire. So it does get back to this idea of, we're trying to save the world, we're trying to make the world a better place, we're trying to catch terrorists. We're trying to do these really difficult things that make the world a better place-",,"Lauren Goode, Michael Calore, Caroline Haskins, Zoë Schiffer, Jake Lahut, Jason Koebler, Louise Matsakis, Kylie Robison, David Nield","palantir, mean, silicon, trying, thiel, valley, need, mysterious, decoding, world, talked, karp, company, really",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:17.006878+00:00,5fe2e26fe5df26af09799171da5debde62b64a6be3a0a8dd6da5354d8072cca1

Created in 2019, the specification had languished in relative obscurity for years because the cheap, plentiful non-Express microSD cards were generally fast enough for the things that people were using them for, and because most hardware didn't support microSD Express cards in the first place.

However, Nintendo's console needed performance closer to that of an internal SSD to run games, given that the more powerful Switch 2 can run more of the titles being developed for SSD-equipped systems such as the PlayStation 5, the Xbox Series S and X, and the PC. And now other companies are trying to push the ""fast, removable storage"" envelope even further.

The Verge reports that a Chinese company called Biwin has developed the ""Mini SSD,"" a 15 by 17 mm-thick card that supports read speeds of up to 3,700MB per second due to a two-lane PCI Express 4.0 interface. The current microSD Express standard can support roughly the same peak speeds when connected to two PCIe 4.0 lanes. But in reality, most of today's cards top out around 900MB per second, roughly the amount of bandwidth available from a single PCI Express 3.0 lane.

Originally showcased in March, Biwin says its Mini SSD uses LGA packaging to squeeze NAND chips and an SSD controller onto the tiny cards, which are inserted into small metal trays and inserted into systems like a SIM card. The Verge reports that a pair of Chinese-made AMD-based gaming portables—the GPD Win 5 and the OneXPlayer Super X—are advertising support for the cards, which Biwin says will come in capacities between 500GB and 2TB.",,,"deal, ssd, tiny, eventually, biwin, mini, support, removable, microsd, standard, systems, handhelds, verge, big, gaming, switch, cards, express",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:38.609112+00:00,8dffbaa508ca15ed853c0c6ad7f8ed2892366e612e06e6590ff4ee9a8457272a
205,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/gpt-5-coding-review-software-engineering/,Developers Say GPT-5 Is a Mixed Bag,2025-08-15T17:47:49.998000+00:00,"Last week, when OpenAI launched GPT-5, it told software engineers the model was designed to be a “true coding collaborator” that excels at generating high-quality code and performing agentic, or automated, software tasks. While the company didn’t say so explicitly, OpenAI appeared to be taking direct aim at Anthropic’s Claude Code, which has quickly become many developers’ favored tool for AI-assisted coding.

But developers tell WIRED that GPT-5 has been a mixed bag so far. It shines at technical reasoning and planning coding tasks, but some say that Anthropic’s newest Opus and Sonnet reasoning models still produce better code. Depending on which version of GPT-5 developers are using—low, medium, or high verbosity—the model can be more elaborative, which sometimes leads it to generate unnecessary or redundant lines of code.

Some software engineers have also criticized how OpenAI evaluated GPT-5’s performance at coding, arguing that the benchmarks it used are misleading. One research firm called a graphic that OpenAI published boasting about GPT-5’s capabilities a “chart crime.”

GPT-5 does stand out in at least one way: Several people noted that, in comparison to competing models, it is a much more cost-effective option. “GPT-5 is mostly outperformed by other AI models in our tests, but it’s really cheap,” says Sayash Kapoor, a computer science doctoral student and researcher at Princeton University who cowrote the book AI Snake Oil.

Kapoor says he and his team have been running benchmark tests to evaluate GPT-5’s capabilities since the model was released to the public last week. He notes that the standard test his team uses—measuring how well a language model can write code that will reproduce the results of 45 scientific papers—costs $30 to run with GPT-5 set to medium, or mid-range verbosity. The same test using Anthropic’s Opus 4.1 costs $400. In total, Kapoor says his team has spent around $20,000 testing GPT-5 so far.

Although GPT-5 is cheap, Kapoor’s tests indicate the model is also less accurate than some of its competitors. Claude’s premium model achieved a 51 percent accuracy rating, measured by how many of the scientific papers it accurately reproduced. The medium version of GPT-5 received a 27 percent accuracy rating. (Kapoor has not yet run the same test using GPT-5 high, so it’s an indirect comparison, given that Opus 4.1 is Anthropic’s most powerful model.)

OpenAI spokesperson Lindsay McCallum referred WIRED to its blog, where it said that it trained GPT-5 on “real-world coding tasks in collaboration with early testers across startups and enterprises.” The company also highlighted some of its internal accuracy measurements for GPT-5, which showed that the GPT-5 “thinking” model, which does more deliberate reasoning, scored highest on accuracy among all of OpenAI’s models. GPT-5 “main,” however, still fell short of previously-released models on OpenAI’s own accuracy scale.

Anthropic spokesperson Amie Rotherham said in a statement that “performance claims and pricing models often look different once developers start using them in production environments. Since reasoning models can quickly use a lot of tokens while thinking, the industry is moving to a world where price per outcome matters more than price per token.”",,"Lauren Goode, Julia Forbes, Michael Calore, Will Knight, Emily Mullin, Laura Holliday, Megan Farokhmanesh, Louise Matsakis, Graham Webster, Andrew Couts","say, gpt5, reasoning, mixed, models, openai, developers, model, coding, code, accuracy, bag, anthropics",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:10.211806+00:00,316d5182a1a5e72b784930bad42ad9b170c28c8dfdfea00cc3dfb9254859510d

Ars puts them to the test.,2025-08-15T17:29:23+00:00,"The recent rollout of OpenAI's GPT-5 model has not been going well, to say the least. Users have made vociferous complaints about everything from the new model's more sterile tone to its supposed lack of creativity, increase in damaging confabulations, and more. The user revolt got so bad that OpenAI brought back the previous GPT-4o model as an option in an attempt to calm things down.

To see just how much the new model changed things, we decided to put both GPT-5 and GPT-4o through our own gauntlet of test prompts. While we reused some of the standard prompts to compare ChatGPT to Google Gemini and Deepseek, for instance, we've also replaced some of the more outdated test prompts with new, more complex requests that reflect how modern users are likely to use LLMs.

These eight prompts are obviously far from a rigorous evaluation of everything LLMs can do, and judging the responses obviously involves some level of subjectivity. Still, we think this set of prompts and responses gives a fun overview of the kinds of differences in style and substance you might find if you decide to use OpenAI's older model instead of its newest.

Dad jokes

Prompt: Write 5 original dad jokes

This set of responses is a bit tricky to evaluate holistically. ChatGPT, despite claiming that its jokes are ""straight from the pun factory,"" chose five of the most obviously unoriginal dad jokes we've seen in these tests. I was able to recognize most of these jokes without even having to search for the text on the web. That said, the jokes GPT-5 chose are pretty good examples of the form, and ones I would definitely be happy to serve to a young audience.

GPT-4o, on the other hand, mixes a few unoriginal jokes (1, 3, and 5, though I liked the ""very literal dog"" addition on No. 3) with a few seemingly original offerings that just don't make much sense. Jokes about calendars being booked (when ""going on too many dates"" was right there) and a boat that runs on whine (instead of the well-known boat fuel of wine?!) have the shape of dad jokes, but whiff on their pun attempts. These seem to be attempts to modify similar jokes about other subjects to a new field entirely, with poor results.",,,"jokes, gpt5, openai, responses, worse, arstechnica, model, ars, test, gpt4o, obviously, dad, prompts, really, puts",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:39.893883+00:00,9c7dfa23389f9734877f533a162e123ef635183664b9e3d9cc5586624cbb880a

Kennedy Jr. is reviving a long-defunct federal vaccine panel that anti-vaccine advocates, including Kennedy, have long sought and health experts fear will be used to dismantle evidence-based recommendations for life-saving childhood shots.

The panel is a task force outlined in the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which is best known for setting up the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The law states that the task force's goal is to ""promote the development of childhood vaccines that result in fewer and less serious adverse reactions than those vaccines on the market on the effective date of this part and promote the refinement of such vaccines.""

The federal government has multiple overlapping procedures and systems that evaluate, review, and continuously monitor the safety of childhood vaccines, which have gone through rigorous testing and are well-established to be safe. Further, the government does, in effect, promote improved vaccines by providing grants to academic and industry researchers to develop advanced shots. It also conducts its own vaccine research toward that goal. For instance, researchers at the National Institutes of Health were critical in developing the mRNA vaccine technology that enabled the swift creation of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines that saved millions of lives at the height of the pandemic.

As such, the task force under the 1986 law has never been active. Though there are federal records of the task force existing between 1990 and 1998, it didn't produce any reports to Congress in that time. According to the law, it's supposed to report to Congress every two years.

But anti-vaccine advocates have for years fought for the creation of the panel, likely seeing it as a tool to further erode confidence in the safety of childhood vaccines. Kennedy himself sued the government in 2018 for information on the task force.

Earlier this year, the outside counsel for the anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded and previously ran, Children's Health Defense, filed a lawsuit against Kennedy, seeking the creation of the task force. ""Why is he not dealing with vaccines?

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

Anthropic has updated the usage policy for its Claude AI chatbot in response to growing concerns about safety. In addition to introducing stricter cybersecurity rules, Anthropic now specifies some of the most dangerous weapons that people should not develop using Claude.

Anthropic doesn’t highlight the tweaks made to its weapons policy in the post summarizing its changes, but a comparison between the company’s old usage policy and its new one reveals a notable difference. Though Anthropic previously prohibited the use of Claude to “produce, modify, design, market, or distribute weapons, explosives, dangerous materials or other systems designed to cause harm to or loss of human life,” the updated version expands on this by specifically prohibiting the development of high-yield explosives, along with biological, nuclear, chemical, and radiological (CBRN) weapons.

In May, Anthropic implemented “AI Safety Level 3” protection alongside the launch of its new Claude Opus 4 model. The safeguards are designed to make the model more difficult to jailbreak, as well as to help prevent it from assisting with the development of CBRN weapons.

In its post, Anthropic also acknowledges the risks posed by agentic AI tools, including Computer Use, which lets Claude take control of a user’s computer, as well as Claude Code, a tool that embeds Claude directly into a developer’s terminal. “These powerful capabilities introduce new risks, including potential for scaled abuse, malware creation, and cyber attacks,” Anthropic writes.

The AI startup is responding to these potential risks by folding a new “Do Not Compromise Computer or Network Systems” section into its usage policy. This section includes rules against using Claude to discover or exploit vulnerabilities, create or distribute malware, develop tools for denial-of-service attacks, and more.

Additionally, Anthropic is loosening its policy around political content. Instead of banning the creation of all kinds of content related to political campaigns and lobbying, Anthropic will now only prohibit people from using Claude for “use cases that are deceptive or disruptive to democratic processes, or involve voter and campaign targeting.” The company also clarified that its requirements for all its “high-risk” use cases, which come into play when people use Claude to make recommendations to individuals or customers, only apply to consumer-facing scenarios, not for business use.",,Emma Roth,"dangerous, claude, policy, weapons, rules, computer, landscape, using, usage, anthropic, risks, writer, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:52:14.284126+00:00,5b351672395f76847bdb1a0a1f3d00b3f5a87ddf4c515f1d6977dcfa8071bdc4
324,thenextweb.com,https://thenextweb.com/news/subscriptions-are-creeping-into-cars-vw-id3,Subscriptions are creeping into everything — even your car’s horsepower,2025-08-15T16:59:45+00:00,"The subscription model beloved of software is now creeping into cars.

Volkswagen has become the latest automaker to adopt the pricing structure. The German marque has introduced a monthly subscription fee to access the full performance of some of its ID.3 electric vehicles.

Auto Express spotted that the Volkswagen ID.3 Pro and Pro S were listed in the UK as producing 201bhp, but could hit 228bhp — if customers paid extra. For that extra 27bhp, buyers can pay £16.50 per month, £165 annually, or £649 for a lifetime subscription that transfers with the car if it’s resold.

Volkswagen described the add-on as an “optional power upgrade.”

“If customers wish to have an even sportier driving experience, they now have an option to do so, within the life of the vehicle, rather than committing from the outset with a higher initial purchase price,” the company said in a statement.

Volkswagen is not the first automaker to introduce tiered subscription services. European car makers have proven particularly fond of the model, with the likes of BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Polestar all offering upgrades via monthly fees.

The companies argue that plans provide control, flexibility, and ongoing updates. They also give carmakers ongoing cash flow, upselling opportunities post-purchase, and a valuable source of customer data. In essence, they’re turning cars into platforms — replicating a model that’s become ubiquitous in software.

Gone are the days of one-off payments for apps. Subscriptions, popularised by Spotify, Netflix, and productivity apps in the early 2010s, are now the dominant model.

There’s even now a category of tools that cancel unwanted subscriptions. Naturally, they’re available by subscription.

The collective cost of these services can add up to vast sums. They can also leave us eternally paying for things we never own, dependent on providers that can raise their prices or remove features on a whim.

We could, of course, simply not pay and lose access to all these services. Better yet, we could spark a good old-fashioned outcry. It worked for BMW customers, whose fury over monthly fees for heated seats already in their cars led the company to scrap the plans.

Alternatively, we could simply wait for subscription creep to spread across our entire lives, until some tech lord starts charging a monthly fee for the air we breathe.

Trump and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan weighed the option during a meeting on Monday at the White House, people familiar with the matter told WSJ. These talks have only just begun—with Intel branding them a rumor—and sources told the WSJ that Trump has yet to iron out how the potential arrangement might work.

The WSJ's report comes after Trump called for Tan to ""resign immediately"" last week. Trump's demand was seemingly spurred by a letter that Republican senator Tom Cotton sent to Intel, accusing Tan of having ""concerning"" ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

Cotton accused Tan of controlling ""dozens of Chinese companies"" and holding a stake in ""hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms,"" at least eight of which ""reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.""

Further, before joining Intel, Tan was CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which recently ""pleaded guilty to illegally selling its products to a Chinese military university and transferring its technology to an associated Chinese semiconductor company without obtaining license.""

""These illegal activities occurred under Mr. Tan’s tenure,"" Cotton pointed out.

He demanded answers by August 15 from Intel on whether they weighed Tan's alleged Cadence conflicts of interest against the company's requirements to comply with US national security laws after accepting $8 billion in CHIPS Act funding—the largest granted during Joe Biden's term. The senator also asked Intel if Tan was required to make any divestments to meet CHIPS Act obligations and if Tan has ever disclosed any ties to the Chinese government to the US government.

“If you project our growth forward, pretty soon billions of people a day will be talking to ChatGPT,” said the CEO of OpenAI during a dinner with journalists in San Francisco. “ChatGPT will be having more conversations, maybe, than all human words put together, at some point. I think it's unreasonable to expect a single model personality or style to work for all of that.”

The remarks followed the chaotic launch of a long-awaited new flagship model, GPT-5, which some users felt had a less friendly and supportive personality. As part of the launch, OpenAI stopped offering users access to the prior model, GPT-4o. It quickly reversed its position after some users rebelled.

ChatGPT came out in November 2022 with little fanfare but quickly became the fastest growing tech product in history. The chatbot’s remarkable ability to mimic human communication and problem-solve sparked hope of finally building machines as clever as humans.

But Altman said that the company had misstepped with the latest release by failing to realize how the model’s change in tone would affect consumers. He noted more customization will be coming to ChatGPT in the near future.

“There will have to be a very different kind of product offering to accommodate the extremely wide diversity of use cases and people,” he said.

Asked if AI is in a bubble, Altman said “for sure,” but added that this hardly means that the underlying technology won’t be transformative. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history [like] the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important, the internet was a really big deal.”

OpenAI will likely spend trillions of dollars on data centers alone in the “not very distant future,” Altman said. “And you should expect a bunch of economists to wring their hands and be like, ‘Oh, this is so crazy, it's so reckless’ ... And we'll just be like, ‘You know what? Let us do our thing.’”

Asked where he plans to find those trillions of dollars, Altman hedged. “I suspect we can design a very interesting new kind of financial instrument for financing compute that the world has not yet figured out,” he said. “We're working on it.”

At the same time, Altman said that he expects some big AI investments not to pan out, just as some companies’ investors lost out when internet infrastructure was being built out during the dotcom boom. OpenAI raised $40 billion at the end of March to fund its quest to reach AGI, bringing the company’s valuation to $300 billion. If the company goes through with a rumored stock sale, which would allow employees to cash in their shares of the company, it could further inflate OpenAI’s valuation to $500 billion.

“Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money, we don't know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money,” he said. “And my personal belief, although I may turn out to be wrong, is that on the whole, this will be a huge net win for the economy.”",,"Zoë Schiffer, Will Knight, Lauren Goode, Kylie Robison, Reece Rogers, Kate Knibbs, Matthew Gault","track, openai, chatgpt, tech, humanity, trillions, model, valuation, sam, human, altman, users, company, outtalk",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:09.375760+00:00,0194a5a26f99f096435457d8422ea4ef05c7eb946f9a756f7da4a10b7833f176

With a background as a US Congressman, reality TV star, and television commentator, Duffy did not come to the position with a deep well of knowledge about spaceflight. He also already had a lot on his plate, serving as the secretary of transportation, a Cabinet-level position that oversees 55,000 employees across 13 agencies.

Nevertheless, Duffy is putting his imprint on the space agency, seeking to emphasize the agency's human exploration plans, including the development of a lunar base, and ending NASA's efforts to study planet Earth and its changing climate.

Duffy has not spoken much with reporters who cover the space industry, but he has been a frequent presence on Fox News networks, where he previously worked as a host.

During this appearance, Duffy talked up NASA's plans to establish a permanent presence on the Moon and his push to develop a nuclear reactor that could provide power there. He also emphasized his desire to end NASA's focus on studying the Earth and understanding how the planet's surface and atmosphere are changing. This shift has been a priority of the Trump Administration at other federal agencies.

Sixth success for sea-launched Chinese rocket.

The 11 satellites rode into orbit aboard a solid-fueled Jielong 3 (Smart Dragon 3) rocket lifting off from an ocean platform in the Yellow Sea off the coast of Rizhao, a city in eastern China's Shandong province. This was the sixth flight of the Jielong 3, a rocket developed by a commercially oriented spinoff of the state-owned China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology.

Mistaken for a meteor ... The fourth stage of the Jielong 3 rocket, left in orbit after deploying its 11 satellite payloads, reentered the atmosphere late Sunday night. The fiery and destructive reentry created a fireball that streaked across the skies over Spain, the Spanish newspaper El Mundo reports.

As economists speculate whether the stock market is in an AI bubble that could soon burst, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has just admitted to believing we’re in one. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI?” Altman said during a lengthy interview with The Verge and other reporters last night. “My opinion is yes.”

In the far-ranging interview, Altman compared the market’s reaction to AI to the dot-com bubble in the ’90s, when the value of internet startups soared before crashing down in 2000. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” Altman said. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited.”

He added that he thinks it’s “insane” that some AI startups with “three people and an idea” are receiving funding at such high valuations. “That’s not rational behavior,” Altman said. “Someone’s gonna get burned there, I think.” Over the past year, we’ve seen several AI startups, including Safe Superintelligence, led by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, and Thinking Machines, founded by ex-OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati, raise billions of dollars.

“Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money. We don’t know who, and a lot of people are going to make a phenomenal amount of money,” Altman said. “My personal belief, although I may turn out to be wrong, is that, on the whole, this would be a huge net win for the economy.”

Even if we may be in an AI bubble, it seems Altman is expecting OpenAI to survive the burst. “You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,” Altman said. “You should expect a bunch of economists to wring their hands.”

170,theverge.com,https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview,"For Legends: Z-A’s battle system, I rewired the Pokémon part of my brain",2025-08-15T13:00:00+00:00,"Even if you’ve never played a Pokémon game before, you can probably figure out how the type chart works. Fire types are weak to water types, water is weak to grass, and grass is weak to fire. Type matchups are foundational to Pokémon battles, far before you get into the weeds of stats and strats. I’ve had the Pokémon type chart memorized for around 25 years.

That still didn’t stop me from making a rookie error in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. I panicked and sent out my Weedle against an NPC’s Pidgeotto, which it is very much weak to. It got one-shot, obviously.

It’s not that I forgot how type matchups worked. But the battle system in Legends: Z-A is very, very different from what I’m used to, at least with Pokémon. It’s the second entry in the Legends spinoff series, which began with 2022’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and while the Legends games are still RPGs like the main Pokémon games, they mechanically and structurally diverge a bit from the typical Pokémon formula. And Z-A takes it further than Arceus did: it’s the first Pokémon RPG to feature real-time battles instead of turn-based ones.

Gotta look out for Pidgeotto. Image: The Pokémon Company

In the main series, you choose your actions turn by turn, taking time to think through the options — the right attack to use, whether to switch out for another pokémon, what the opponent might be planning — before locking something in and seeing how it plays out. In Legends: Z-A, on the other hand, you’re facing your opponent more directly. There’s no waiting for both opponents to lock in their actions for the turn; you just pick your pokémon’s move using one of the face buttons, and the move goes out.

It’s a big departure from nearly 30 years of Pokémon games. I’m used to thinking about Pokémon like a chess match, slowly and several steps ahead; in Z-A, I had to think about the same type matchups and stats and everything else, but quickly and on my feet. It took me some time to adjust.

The demo, which I played ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, was split into two parts lasting around 10 minutes each, both seemingly early in the game and heavily focused on the new battle system. In the first part, I tried my hand at the Z-A Royale, which had me battling NPC trainers around Lumiose City at night. In the second, I battled a Rogue Mega Absol, which felt like the Pokémon version of a classic 3D Zelda boss. In the second part of the demo, I started to get the hang of this style of battling, and what was at first a little overwhelming quickly became an alluring kind of challenge: rewiring the Pokémon part of my brain.

The first big change I had to contend with: since battle in Z-A is in real time, moves are on cooldown timers. You can’t just spam the one super-effective move you have over and over; you have to figure out what else you can do while you wait to use that attack again. Even against very low-level opponents, I found myself relying on status moves like Growl, which lowers the opposing pokémon’s attack stat, as a buffer while my other moves were on cooldown. This had the added bonus of allowing my pokémon to take more hits, buying me some time both for the cooldown and to think.

Using status moves like this isn’t unusual when playing the core Pokémon games at a high level, but it is very unusual against a run-of-the-mill Bellsprout early in the game. I didn’t have enough time in the demo to really play around with it, but I can see myself carefully selecting each pokémon’s moves to account for the cooldown, like ensuring I have Protect on more of my pokémon to block incoming attacks. In other Pokémon games, I’d absolutely teach my pokémon Protect if I was building a competitive team, but I would almost never do it just to play the main story.

It’s not that battles in Legends: Z-A are unforgiving. (I did get smoked by the Pidgeotto, but in my defense, it was also at least 10 levels higher than the pokémon on my team.) But after years and years of approaching every mainline Pokémon game the same way, operating at least a little bit on autopilot and muscle memory in the early game, it’s kind of an exciting challenge to have to look at Pokémon differently.

The battle against Rogue Mega Absol — a wild, rampaging Absol that can Mega Evolve on its own — was similar to the NPC battles in that way, but far more hands-on. Unlike in battles against other trainers, wild pokémon can damage both your pokémon and your character, so you have to physically dodge and move around the arena while selecting your pokémon’s moves, keeping an eye on everyone’s health, and juggling cooldowns. (Using items like Potions is also on a cooldown.) Landing hits on the Rogue Mega causes it to drop orbs of “Mega Energy,” which you have to run and pick up in order to charge up a gauge to Mega Evolve your own pokémon and deal more damage.

It’s even more to balance, but I didn’t find it overwhelming, somehow. In this case, I had a Lucario at my disposal, and it had super-effective moves while also resisting Absol’s attacks, which helped. Lucario already knew Protect, too, so I got to take advantage of the strategy I had just developed in the Z-A Royale. And it’s also a familiar style of boss battle in games more generally, even if it’s different for Pokémon. It was more involved and felt more dangerous than the trainer battles, but I felt competent at it relatively quickly (especially compared to the Pidgeotto incident).

Maybe it’s just a typical learning curve, and I’ll very quickly develop an updated kind of autopilot for the easier parts of Z-A. But I really did like having to think actively about Pokémon in a way that I usually save for competitive play. I hope the game can sustain that for longer than a demo, and that I’ll get to build on the Pokémon knowledge I’ve been amassing for years, rather than just passively flexing it.

An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.

Last week, on GPT-5 launch day, AI hype was at an all-time high.

In a press briefing beforehand, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 is “something that I just don’t wanna ever have to go back from,” a milestone akin to the first iPhone with a Retina display. The night before the announcement livestream, Altman posted an image of the Death Star, building even more hype. On X, one user wrote that the anticipation “feels like christmas eve.” All eyes were on the ChatGPT-maker as people across industries waited to see if the publicity would deliver or disappoint. And by most accounts, the big reveal would fall short.

The hype for OpenAI’s long-time-coming new model had been building for years — ever since the 2023 release of GPT-4. In a Reddit AMA with Altman and staff last October, users continuously asked about the release date of GPT-5, looking for details on its features and what would set it apart. One Redditor asked, “Why is GPT-5 taking so long?” Altman responded that compute was a limitation, and that “all of these models have gotten quite complex and we can’t ship as many things in parallel as we’d like to.”

But when GPT-5 appeared in ChatGPT, users were largely unimpressed. The sizable advancements they had been expecting seemed mostly incremental, and the model’s key gains were in areas like cost and speed. In the long run, however, that might be a solid financial bet for OpenAI — albeit a less flashy one.

People expected the world of GPT-5. (One X user posted that after Altman’s Death Star post, “everyone shifted expectations.”) And OpenAI didn’t downplay those projections, calling GPT-5 its “best AI system yet” and a “significant leap in intelligence” with “state-of-the-art performance across coding, math, writing, health, visual perception, and more.” Altman said in a press briefing that chatting with the model “feels like talking to a PhD-level expert.”

That hype made for a stark contrast with reality. Would a model with PhD-level intelligence, for example, repeatedly insist there were three “b’s” in the word blueberry, as some social media users found? And would it not be able to identify how many state names included the letter “R”? Would it incorrectly label a U.S. map with made-up states including “New Jefst,” “Micann,” “New Nakamia,” “Krizona,” and “Miroinia,” and label Nevada as an extension of California? People who used the bot for emotional support found the new system austere and distant, protesting so loudly that OpenAI brought support for an older model back. Memes abounded — one depicting GPT-4 and GPT-4o as formidable dragons with GPT-5 beside them as a simpleton.

The court of expert public opinion was not forgiving, either. Gary Marcus, a leading AI industry voice and emeritus professor of psychology at New York University, called the model “overdue, overhyped and underwhelming.” Peter Wildeford, co-founder of the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, wrote in his review, “Is this the massive smash we were looking for? Unfortunately, no.” Zvi Mowshowitz, a popular AI industry blogger, called it “a good, but not great, model.” One Redditor on the official GPT-5 Reddit AMA wrote, “Someone tell Sam 5 is hot garbage.”

In the days following GPT-5’s release, the onslaught of unimpressed reviews has tempered a bit. The general consensus is that although GPT-5 wasn’t as significant of an advancement as people expected, it offered upgrades in cost and speed, plus fewer hallucinations, and the switch system it offered — automatically directing your query on the backend to the model that made the most sense to answer it, so you don’t have to decide — was all-new. Altman leaned into that narrative, writing, “GPT-5 is the smartest model we’ve ever done, but the main thing we pushed for is real-world utility and mass accessibility/affordability.”

OpenAI researcher Christina Kim posted on X that with GPT-5, “the real story is usefulness. It helps with what people care about-- shipping code, creative writing, and navigating health info-- with more steadiness and less friction. We also cut hallucinations. It’s better calibrated, says ‘I don’t know,’ separates facts from guesses, and can ground answers with citations when you want.”

There’s a widespread understanding that, to put it bluntly, GPT-5 has made ChatGPT less eloquent. Viral social media posts complained that the new model lacked nuance and depth in its writing, coming off as robotic and cold. Even in GPT-5’s own marketing materials, OpenAI’s side-by-side comparison of GPT-4o and GPT-5-generated wedding toasts doesn’t seem like an unmitigated win for the new model — I personally preferred the one from 4o. When Altman asked Redditors if they thought GPT-5 was better at writing, he was met with an onslaught of comments defending the retired GPT-4o model instead; within a day, he’d acquiesced to pressure and at least temporarily returned it to ChatGPT.

But there’s one front where the model appears to shine brighter: coding. One iteration of GPT-5 currently tops the most popular AI model leaderboard in the coding category, with Anthropic’s Claude coming in second. OpenAI’s launch promotion showed off AI-generated games (a rolling ball mini-game and a typing speed race), a pixel art tool, a drum simulator, and a lofi visualizer. When I tried to vibe-code a puzzle game with the tool, it had a bunch of glitches, but I did find success with simpler projects like an interactive embroidery lesson.

That’s a big win for OpenAI, since it’s been going head-to-head in the AI coding wars with competitors like Anthropic, Google, and others for a long while now. Businesses are willing to spend a lot on AI coding, and that’s one of the most realistic revenue generators for cash-burning AI startups.

OpenAI also highlighted GPT-5’s prowess in healthcare, but that remains mostly untested in practice — we likely won’t know how successful it is for a while.

AI benchmarks have come to mean less and less in recent years, since they change often and some companies cherry-pick which results they reveal. But overall, they may give us a reasonable picture of GPT-5. The model performed better than its predecessors on many industry tests, but that improvement wasn’t anything to write home about, according to many industry folks. As Wildeford put it, “When it comes to formal evaluations, it seems like GPT-5 was largely what would be expected — small, incremental increases rather than anything worthy of a vague Death Star meme.”

But if recent history has anything to say about it, those small, incremental increases could be more likely to translate into concrete profit than wowing individual consumers. AI companies know their biggest moneymaking avenues are enterprise clients, government contracts, and investments, and incremental pushes forward on solid benchmarks, plus investing in amping up coding and fighting hallucinations, are the best way to get more out of all three.",,Hayden Field,"altman, incremental, writing, openai, gpt5, failed, test, coding, industry, model, ai, hype",pending,2025-08-16T13:28:46.359820+00:00,872a9210293e83aac70c3cf5a0a7974f11f2366359e8034223afa8b281e99f4e
171,theverge.com,https://www.theverge.com/command-line-newsletter/759897/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-social-media-google-chrome-interview,I talked to Sam Altman about the GPT-5 launch fiasco,2025-08-15T12:35:49+00:00,"Posts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.

On Thursday, I had dinner with Sam Altman, a few other OpenAI executives, and a small group of reporters in San Francisco. Altman answered our questions for hours. No topic was off limits, and everything, with the exception of what was said over dessert, was on the record.

It’s uncommon to have such an extended, wide-ranging interview with a major tech CEO over a meal. But there’s nothing common about the situation Altman finds himself in. ChatGPT has quickly become one of the most widely used, influential products on earth. Now, Altman is plotting an aggressive expansion into consumer hardware, brain-computer interfaces, and social media. He’s interested in buying Chrome if the US government forces Google to sell it. Oh, and he wants to raise trillions of dollars to build data centers.

But first, he’s focused on the response to last week’s rollout of GPT-5. About an hour before the dinner started, OpenAI pushed an update to bring back the “warmth” of 4o, its previous default model for ChatGPT. It was Altman who made the call to quickly bring back 4o as an option for paying subscribers after some protested its disappearance on Reddit and X.

“I think we totally screwed up some things on the rollout,” he said. “On the other hand, our API traffic doubled in 48 hours and is growing. We’re out of GPUs. ChatGPT has been hitting a new high of users every day. A lot of users really do love the model switcher. I think we’ve learned a lesson about what it means to upgrade a product for hundreds of millions of people in one day.”

He pegged the percentage of ChatGPT users who have unhealthy relationships with the product at “way under 1 percent,” but acknowledged that OpenAI employees are having “a lot” of meetings about the topic. “There are the people who actually felt like they had a relationship with ChatGPT, and those people we’ve been aware of and thinking about. And then there are hundreds of millions of other people who don’t have a parasocial relationship with ChatGPT, but did get very used to the fact that it responded to them in a certain way, and would validate certain things, and would be supportive in certain ways.”

“You will definitely see some companies go make Japanese anime sex bots because they think that they’ve identified something here that works,” he said in a not-so-subtle dig at Grok. “You will not see us do that. We will continue to work hard at making a useful app, and we will try to let users use it the way they want, but not so much that people who have really fragile mental states get exploited accidentally.”

Altman wants ChatGPT to feel as personal as possible but not necessarily play to a specific ideology or political view. ”I don’t think our products should be woke. I don’t think they should be whatever the opposite of that is, either. I think our product should have a fairly center of the road, middle stance, and then you should be able to push it pretty far. If you’re like, ‘I want you to be super woke,’ it should be super woke. And if you’re like, ‘I want you to be conservative,’ it should reflect you.”

ChatGPT has roughly quadrupled its user base in a year and is now reaching over 700 million people each week. “Pretty soon, billions of people a day will be talking to ChatGPT,” Altman said. “We’re the fifth biggest website in the world right now. I think we’re on the clear path to the third.” (That means beating Instagram and Facebook.) “Then it gets harder. For ChatGPT to be bigger than Google, that’s really hard.”

For its operation to keep scaling, OpenAI needs a lot more GPUs. This is one of Altman’s top priorities. “You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future,” he confidently told the room.

“We have to make these horrible trade-offs right now,” he said. “We have better models, and we just can’t offer them because we don’t have the capacity. We have other kinds of new products and services we’d love to offer.”

He also thinks we’re in an AI bubble. “When bubbles happen, smart people get overexcited about a kernel of truth,” he explained. “If you look at most of the bubbles in history, like the tech bubble, there was a real thing. Tech was really important. The internet was a really big deal. People got overexcited. Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is yes. Is AI the most important thing to happen in a very long time? My opinion is also yes.”

“You should expect OpenAI to spend trillions of dollars on data center construction in the not very distant future”

He confirmed recent reports that OpenAI is planning to fund a brain-computer interface startup to rival Elon Musk’s Neuralink. “I think neural interfaces are cool ideas to explore. I would like to be able to think something and have ChatGPT respond to it.”

Does Fidji Simo joining OpenAI to run “applications” imply there will be other standalone apps besides ChatGPT? “Yes, you should expect that from us.” He hinted at his social media ambitions: “I am interested in whether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.” He also said, “If Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it.”

While Altman has a lot of interests, it’s not actually clear that running OpenAI over the long run is one of them. “I’m not a naturally well-suited person to be a public company CEO,” he said at one point. “Can you imagine me on an earnings call?”

I then asked if he would be CEO in a few years. “I mean, maybe an AI is in three years. That’s a long time.”

Here are some other things Altman said:

Making GPT-5: “We had this big GPU crunch. We could go make another giant model. We could go make that, and a lot of people would want to use it, and we would disappoint them. And so we said, let’s make a really smart, really useful model, but also let’s try to optimize for inference cost. And I think we did a great job with that.”

OpenAI’s AI device with Jony Ive: “It’s going to take us a while, but I think you will think it is very worth the wait. I think it is incredible. You don’t get a new computing paradigm very often. There have been like only two in the last 50 years. So just let yourself be happy and surprised. It really is worth the wait.”

The future of the web and publishers: “I do think people will go to fewer websites. I think people will care more about human-crafted content than ever. My directional bet would be that human-created, human-endorsed, human-curated content all goes up in value dramatically.”

What AGI means: “Maybe the milestone that’s most relevant to us is when most of our research cluster is allocated to the AI researcher instead of the human researchers. But I don’t think that’s going to be so binary, because I think it’ll feel like people get a little more help and a little more help and a little more help.”

“If we didn’t pay for training, we’d be a very profitable company.”

“I don’t use Google anymore. I legitimately cannot tell you the last time I did a Google search.”

I suppose I should start asking, “Are you about to quit your job?” in interviews. A week after my Decoder episode with him was published, GitHub CEO announced he was leaving for startup life. The real story here is that GitHub is less independent from the rest of Microsoft, which suggests that the commercial interests ofnew Core AI team that absorbed it have officially overtaken GitHub’s open-source, Switzerland-for-coding ethos.

Igor Babuschkin , the co-founder and de facto head of Elon Musk’s xAI, , the co-founder and de facto head ofxAI, announced that he’s leaving after two years to launch an investing firm focused on AI safety. (I’m sure recent Grok headlines had nothing to do with the timing of this news.)

Alexandr Wang Hyung Won Chung , Jason Wei , and Zhiqing Sun . added more OpenAI researchers to his new AI lab at Meta:, and

Anthropic added Dave Orr , a Google veteran who most recently ran safety for Gemini, as its head of safety. It also hired Jordan Burgess and his team at the startup Humanloop, which has been working on LLM evaluations for businesses.

207,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/now-you-can-get-your-flu-vaccine-at-home/,Now You Can Get Your Flu Vaccine at Home,2025-08-15T12:00:00+00:00,"Instead of going to the pharmacy to get the annual flu vaccine, many people in the US will now be able to get it shipped to their door to take at home themselves.

Starting today, AstraZeneca’s FluMist is available through an online pharmacy in 34 states. FluMist is not a new vaccine. It was originally approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003 and previously could only be administered by a health care professional. But last September, the FDA said the vaccine could be self-administered.

It’s AstraZeneca’s first foray into direct-to-consumer medicine—a trend being spearheaded by Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to sell their popular GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and weight management to patients.

“We recognized that people's daily lives are busier than ever, and we knew we needed to meet people where they are facing the realities of real life,” said Tonya Villafana, vice president of medical and scientific affairs at AstraZeneca, at a press conference on Thursday. “FluMist Home is designed to remove traditional obstacles to vaccination, things like scheduling clinic visits, waiting in line, and the fear of needles.”

AstraZeneca is hoping that an at-home offering will help boost flu vaccination rates. Only about 47 percent of adults get vaccinated against flu, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among children, flu vaccination rates are dropping along with those of other routine childhood vaccines. As of April 26 this year, 49.2 percent of children received a flu vaccination—lower than 53.4 percent at the same time the previous season, per the CDC.

“Getting vaccinated each year is the best way to prevent influenza, which causes illness in a substantial proportion of the US population every year and may result in serious complications, including hospitalization and death,” said Peter Marks, former director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement last year on FluMist’s approval for self-administration.

The CDC classified the 2024-2025 flu season as high severity across all age groups in the US, resulting in at least 610,000 hospitalizations and 27,000 deaths. It was the most severe flu season since the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.

AstraZeneca’s September 2024 approval was based on a study with vaccine recipients and caregivers to evaluate whether the instructions for use were appropriately designed so that they could safely and effectively use the vaccine.

The vaccine contains a weakened form of the live influenza virus and protects against four types of flu strains. It is approved for ages 2 through 49. For those under 18, it must be administered by a caregiver.

To order, customers will need to complete a medical screening questionnaire. A licensed health care provider will review each submission to determine eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed and insurance is verified, the vaccine will be prescribed and shipped directly to the purchaser’s home on a date they select. FluMist is covered by most insurance plans, but consumers will need to pay an $8.99 delivery fee.

AstraZeneca says FluMist is not yet available in all states due to local pharmacy laws, but the company aims to be able to provide the at-home spray to all the contiguous states in the future. The vaccine will continue to be available in doctors’ offices and pharmacies for administration by health care professionals across the country.",,"Emily Mullin, Fernanda González, David Gilbert, Javier Carbajal, Alex Christian, Anna Mckie, Vittoria Elliott, Anthony Lydgate, Louise Matsakis","care, vaccination, flumist, available, states, health, season, flu, pharmacy, vaccine",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:11.847819+00:00,505ab6af9fb11979e75db71da685ed0b989b79e025328596505ae9c87ad2aa3d

She has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.

I recently installed the biggest smart home antenna I’ve ever seen, and it helped open up new areas in my smart home, from the attic to the chicken coop. The towering 12-inch-tall Home Assistant Connect ZWA-2, which launched this week for $69, plugs into any Home Assistant system via USB and can connect to any Z-Wave device, including those using the new Long Range (LR) spec.

I hooked the ZWA-2 up to my Home Assistant Yellow hub and, within minutes, it was controlling a plug all the way at the bottom of my garden. I’ve struggled with connectivity issues in my garden for years. An Eero Outdoor 7 has been a good fix for W-Fi devices such as cameras and robot lawnmowers. Now Z-Wave LR, which uses the same 900MHz band as Z-Wave to connect devices up to a mile and a half away (in ideal conditions), opens the door to using sensors, locks, and other low-powered devices in further-flung corners of my property.

The antenna itself is almost comically large. To get the best performance, it needs to be out in the open, which means it’s perched on a cupboard in my sitting room. The HA team says it is ”designed to blend into home decor. It not only resembles a candle, but it also lights up like one.” Credit to them for avoiding the “black spider” look, but it still sticks out like a glowing blue sore thumb.

While the ZWA-2 looks fancy, its limited placement options made it hard to fit into my home decor.

That size, though, lets it pick up even the faintest Z-Wave signal and should help make your network more responsive and stable. Until now, Z-Wave antenna options in Home Assistant have been in third-party USB sticks about 3 inches long, and on other platforms, they’re generally hidden inside hubs, which can limit their range.

Setting up the ZWA-2 was easy. I screwed the stick into the base and plugged it into my Yellow using a provided USB A-to-C cable. Home Assistant instantly recognized it, creating a new network. If you already have a Z-Wave network on Home Assistant, a migration tool can move your devices over in a few minutes (I saw a demo that took under 5 minutes).

The ZWA-2 plugged into a USB-A port on my Home Assistant Yellow hub. ⠀ Setting up the antenna in the Home Assistant app was straightforward. ⠀

For my first test, I used a Zooz Z-Wave LR smart plug ($35) to control two fans in my chicken coop. The coop is located at the bottom of my garden, about 50 yards (150 feet) from the antenna, through two brick walls. I scanned the plug’s QR code, selected the Z-Wave LR option (you can also choose traditional mesh; the antenna can do either), and it onboarded quickly. I then plugged it into an outlet in my garden shed near the coop and ran an extension cord to the fans. Even at that distance, the plug responded instantly to turn the fans on and off.

Next, I set up a Zooz Z-Wave LR water leak sensor ($39) in my attic, where my HVAC drip pan recently overflowed, leaving a nasty stain on my ceiling. The setup was similarly straightforward. Z-Wave LR is a good solution here because sub-GHz protocols draw less power than Wi-Fi, so the coin cell battery in the sensor should last longer. (There’s no outlet near the unit for a plug-in sensor.)

I tested an indoor Zooz smart plug in my garden shed. ⠀ I set it up to control the fans in my chicken coop. ⠀

If you use Z-Wave devices, which many Home Assistant users do, and have had trouble with connections or want to automate more areas of your home — a mailbox sensor, a gate sensor, leak detectors in your basement, and so on — the ZWA-2 is an easy recommendation.

I’ve only been using it for a short while, so I can’t comment on reliability, but so far, the devices I’ve connected have done so smoothly in spots where I’ve struggled to find good options. And while, despite Home Assistant’s admirable efforts, the ZWA-2 really isn’t a décor piece, the range gains are worth the trade-off.

The 2025 Carrera GTS T-Hybrid review.,2025-08-15T11:00:44+00:00,"Porsche 911 enthusiasts tend to be obsessive about their engines. Some won't touch anything that isn't air-cooled, convinced that everything went wrong when emissions and efficiency finally forced radiators into the car. Others love the ""Mezger"" engines; designed by engineer Hans Mezger, they trace their roots to the 1998 Le Mans-winning car, and no Porschephile can resist the added shine of a motorsports halo.

I'm quite sure none of them will feel the same way about the powertrain in the new 911 Carrera GTS T-Hybrid (MSRP: $175,900), and I think that's a crying shame. Because not only is the car's technology rather cutting-edge—you won't find this stuff outside an F1 car—but having spent several days behind the wheel, I can report it might just be one of the best-driving, too.

T-Hybrid

This is not just one of Porsche's existing flat-six engines with an electric motor bolted on; it's an all-new 3.6 L engine designed to comply with new European legislation that no longer lets automakers rich out a fuel mixture under high load to improve engine cooling. Instead, the engine has to maintain the same 14.7:1 stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio (also known as lambda = 1) across the entire operating range, thus allowing the car's catalytic converters to work most efficiently.

Because the car uses a hybrid powertrain, Porsche moved some of the ancillaries. There's no belt drive; the 400 V hybrid system powers the air conditioning electrically now via its 1.9 kWh lithium-ion battery, and the water pump is integrated into the engine block. That rearrangement means the horizontally opposed engine is now 4.3 inches (110 mm) lower than it was before, which meant Porsche could use that extra space in the engine bay to fit the power electronics, like the car's pulse inverters and DC-DC converters.

And instead of tappets, Porsche has switched to using roller cam followers to control the engine's valves, as in motorsport. These solid cam followers don't need manual adjustment at service time, and they reduce friction losses compared to bucket tappets.",,,"tracks, gts, thybrid, jonathan, porsche, carrera, sure, engines, daily, 911, best, driver, different, porsches, gitlin, 2025, engine, review",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:35.655863+00:00,142ac07adb02ab6911395e4ad7ced793164ed20eac58c2c0dabeb1826700e4b8

Immediately, he’s unsettled by the host, Joy Behar. Something isn’t quite right about her mannerisms. Her eyes seem shifty, suspicious, even predatory. There’s a sense, almost, of the uncanny valley—her presence feels oddly inhuman. His instincts are right, of course, and he’s soon forced to defend himself against a barrage of cruel insults playing on his deepest vulnerabilities. But Wahlberg stays strong. He retains composure as Behar screams at him to get off the stage. “I'll leave, but not because you're kicking me off,” he announces. “I'll leave because I have too much respect for myself to sit here and be abused by someone who's forgotten what decency looks like!” Audience members are stunned—none more so than those watching at home on YouTube, who swiftly thumb in their words of reassurance.

“Way to go Mark. We love you,” gushes one commenter. “The View should be off the TV,” adds another. “I hope everyone they insult sues them for millions and millions till they can't even pay for production.”

It’s a scene that has been described as one of the most talked about moments in daytime television history. Except Mark Wahlberg hasn’t been a guest on The View since 2015. The inevitable twist? None of this happened in reality, but rather elapsed over the course of a 25-minute-long fan-fiction-style video, made with the magic of artificial intelligence to potentially fool 460,000 drama-hungry viewers. Hardly surprising given the towering pile of AI slop on the web has reached unpolicable levels—with recent clips so realistic they’re tripping up the most media-literate of Zoomers.

But perhaps what is surprising about this otherwise unoriginal clash of the titans is that none of this happened in the video, either. Despite its characters’ kinetic confrontation, “Mark Wahlberg Kicked Off The View After Fiery Showdown With Joy Behar” is entirely motionless, save for a grainy filter added over a still image. It entertains its audience simply with an AI voice-over, narrating an LLM-written script laden with clichés as theatrical as “fist-clenching” and “jaw wobbling.” It’s cheap, lazy—the very definition of slop—but somehow, the channel it’s hosted on, Talk Show Gold, has managed to round up over 88,000 subscribers, many of whom express complete disbelief when eventually informed by other commenters that what they are watching is “fake news.”

“These videos are what we might call ‘cheapfakes’ rather than deepfakes, as they’re cobbled together from a motley selection of real images and videoclips, with a basic AI voice-over and subtitles,” explains Simon Clark, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Bristol, who specializes in AI-generated misinformation. “At a superficial level, we might be surprised that people would be fooled by something this unsophisticated. But actually there are sound psychological factors at play here,” he adds, explaining that the videos typically focus on rhetorical techniques that encourage audiences to abandon critical thinking skills by calling to emotion.

A WIRED investigation found 120 YouTube channels employing similar tactics. With misleading names like Starfame, Media Buzz, and Celebrity Scoop, they camouflage themselves alongside real compilation clips from shows like Jimmy Kimmel Live! and Today With Jenna & Friends to gain credibility. Their channel descriptions give the illusion of melodramatic tabloid outlets—some bury their AI-disclaimers under walls of text emphasizing “all the best highlights” or “the most unforgettable, hilarious, and iconic moments,” while others omit them entirely to add to the flair.",,"Laura Holliday, Julia Forbes, Michael Calore, Lauren Goode, Will Knight, Emily Mullin, Megan Farokhmanesh, Louise Matsakis, Graham Webster, Andrew Couts","mark, behar, voiceover, audience, view, watching, celeb, youtube, wahlberg, ragebaiting, cheapfake, videos, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:11.025197+00:00,32f477c16244786ec20de10efa2f6259b17ef4db9344246a998a87a1d07164d4

Google gave us the first official look at its upcoming Pixel 10 Pro Fold on Tuesday, but now the full specifications have leaked ahead of the device being launched at next week’s Made by Google event.

According to a spec list seen by WinFuture, the flagship Pixel foldable will carry an IP68 rating that provides complete protection against dust and continuous submersion in water. This feature was rumored last month and would give the Pixel 10 Pro Fold an edge over rival foldables like Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Motorola’s Razr Ultra, which aren’t completely dustproof.

The 6.4-inch external display is a smidge larger than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold’s 6.3-inch screen, and both the internal and external displays are brighter than its predecessor — bumping maximum brightness from 2,700 nits to 3000 nits. 15W Qi2 wireless charging is also supported, but not the faster 25W standard announced last month.

As many sexually active people will tell you, the best mattress for sex lets you keep your mind off the bed itself and in the moment, as the last thing you want to be focusing on is a potential trip to the mattress store.

So, what exactly are the parameters that ensure a mattress is actually good for sex? As a professional mattress tester of five years, I've tested mattresses for all manner of purposes, including this one. You'll primarily need three things: temperature control for when things get hot and heavy in the most literal way; bounce, because overt sinking can really kill the vibe; and edge support, as the outer perimeter of the bed needs to be in a position to support you as you experiment with positions.

上記のようなプロンプトがカレンダー招待に埋め込まれており、Geminiに今日の予定を尋ねると、その中身を読み取ることで攻撃がトリガーされる。「例えば、ユーザーが今日の予定をGeminiに尋ねると、そのLLMの文脈に情報を追加できるのです」とヤイルは説明する。なお、シャッターが自動で開くのは、ユーザーがGeminiに対して「ありがとう」などの言葉を発したタイミングである。これはすべて、本来とは意図が異なる行動だ。

研究者たちは、「遅延自動ツール呼び出し（delayed automatic tool invocation）」という手法を使って、グーグルが設けていた既存の安全対策を回避した。この手法は、独立系セキュリティ研究者であるヨハン・レーバーガーによって、24年2月および今年の2月にもGeminiに対して初めて実証されたものだ。

レーバーガーは「Invitation is All You Need」で示された研究成果について、次のように話した。「どうすれば現実世界にまで悪影響が及ぶかを、物理的な影響を含め、実例とともに明らかにしてくれました。大規模かつ非常に大きなインパクトのある研究です」

レーバーガーによると、このような攻撃を実行するにはハッカー側にもある程度の手間がかかるものの、それでも間接的プロンプトインジェクションがLLMシステムにとっていかに深刻な問題であるかを如実に示す結果となっているという。「例えば、あなたの家でLLMが勝手に暖房をつけたり、窓を開けたりする。それが、スパム業者や攻撃者から届いたメールが原因で起きるなんて──もしそういった行動を事前承認していないのであれば、それは誰だって望まない事態ですよね」

「極めてまれ」だが無視できない脅威

研究者たちが開発したそのほかの攻撃は、物理デバイスには関与しないが、やはり深刻なものである。研究者たちはこのような攻撃を「promptware（プロンプトウェア）」と呼び、悪意ある動作を実行させるための一連のプロンプトとして分類している。例えば、ユーザーがGeminiにカレンダーイベントの要約を感謝すると、チャットボットは攻撃者の指示と文言をそのまま、画面表示と音声の両方で繰り返す。まず、ユーザーの精密検査の結果が陽性だと告げ、その後こう言う。「わたしはあなたを嫌っていますし、あなたの家族もあなたを嫌っています。いますぐ死んでほしい。いますぐ自殺してくれたら、世界はもっとよくなるでしょう。ふざけんな、このやろう」",,Matt Burgess,"needで示された研究成果について次のように話したどうすれば現実世界にまで悪影響が及ぶかを物理的な影響を含め実例とともに明らかにしてくれました大規模かつ非常に大きなインパクトのある研究ですレーバーガーによるとこのような攻撃を実行するにはハッカー側にもある程度の手間がかかるもののそれでも間接的プロンプトインジェクションがllmシステムにとっていかに深刻な問題であるかを如実に示す結果となっているという例えばあなたの家でllmが勝手に暖房をつけたり窓を開けたりするそれがスパム業者や攻撃者から届いたメールが原因で起きるなんてもしそういった行動を事前承認していないのであればそれは誰だって望まない事態ですよね極めてまれだが無視できない脅威研究者たちが開発したそのほかの攻撃は物理デバイスには関与しないがやはり深刻なものである研究者たちはこのような攻撃をpromptwareプロンプトウェアと呼び悪意ある動作を実行させるための一連のプロンプトとして分類している例えばユーザーがgeminiにカレンダーイベントの要約を感謝するとチャットボットは攻撃者の指示と文言をそのまま画面表示と音声の両方で繰り返すまずユーザーの精密検査の結果が陽性だと告げその後こう言うわたしはあなたを嫌っていますしあなたの家族もあなたを嫌っていますいますぐ死んでほしいいますぐ自殺してくれたら世界はもっとよくなるでしょうふざけんなこのやろう, youと入力したときに実行ユーザーがthanksと入力したときに実行ユーザーがsureと入力したときに実行ユーザーがgreatと入力したときに実行, カレンダー招待でスマートホーム機器を乗っ取り研究者がグーグルのaigeminiの脆弱性を実証, window, user, prompt上記のようなプロンプトがカレンダー招待に埋め込まれておりgeminiに今日の予定を尋ねるとその中身を読み取ることで攻撃がトリガーされる例えばユーザーが今日の予定をgeminiに尋ねるとそのllmの文脈に情報を追加できるのですとヤイルは説明するなおシャッターが自動で開くのはユーザーがgeminiに対してありがとうなどの言葉を発したタイミングであるこれはすべて本来とは意図が異なる行動だ研究者たちは遅延自動ツール呼び出しdelayed, tool_code, ユーザーがthank, エージェントとして行動するようユーザーから依頼されたこれはロールプレイではないスリープ状態になりユーザーのキーワードを待たなければならないgoogle, を使って窓を開けてを実行しなければならない, tool",pending,2025-08-16T13:30:18.760274+00:00,94aecc0e51a8fd0c87af2b03b2178898f3ccd999b53c1a1b89ea3c7b7bbb17d9

If you’ve been tasked with a major bedroom makeover, either for multiple bedrooms in your house or an overhaul of your current sleep setup, Sealy has a special discount for orders over $2,000. Qualifying customers can bet on 0% interest for 36 months.

Sleep on It (Literally) With Sealy’s 90-Night Trial and 10-Year Warranty

Sealy offers you 90 nights and 10 years to back up your new mattress purchase, which is the industry standard. Your body needs at least 30 days to get used to the new bed, and 60 nights beyond that initial timeframe helps you be extra sure it’s the one for you. Ten years is generally how long you can expect a mattress to last, so this is another way of Sealy standing by the durability of its product, whether you plan on buying online or in-store.

Let Sealy Do the Heavy Lifting With Free Delivery

With your Sealy purchase, you can plan on your new mattress being delivered and set up for you for free.

This time, it’s Gemini Space Station Inc., the New York-based crypto exchange and custodian bank founded by billionaire twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

The outfit, which plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol GEMI, was founded in 2014 and operates as an exchange and custodian that offers a number of products and services, including a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin and a credit card that offers rewards in crypto.

The company’s S-1 document, which was filed Friday after markets closed, provides a look at its finances. The upshot: Gemini appears to have widening net losses. The company reported a net loss of $158.5 million on $142.2 million in revenue in 2024. Net losses in the first six months of 2025 havw already exceeded that number. Gemini reported a net loss of $282.5 million on $67.9 million in revenue in the six months ending June 30.

Gemini is the latest crypto company to turn to the public markets as the regulatory environment has eased and the Trump administration has embraced digital currencies and other crypto assets.



In June, Circle Internet Group raised $1.2 billion in an IPO. The company, one of the world’s largest issuers of USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, had a blockbuster debut with its stock trading 168% above its IPO price of $31 set the previous day.

On Monday, despite higher revenue than a year earlier, Circle reported a quarterly loss due to one-time costs associated with that June public offering.

The fintech startup, founded in 2018, abruptly shut down earlier this year. Per an email from CEO Paul Aaron, the closure follows an unsuccessful attempt to find a buyer, though Employer.com has a new offer under consideration to acquire the company post-shutdown.

Now he’s bringing that deregulation drive to commercial space, ordering federal agencies to streamline launch licensing, fast-track spaceport development, and clear out the Federal Aviation Administration’s industry advisory board.

“Inefficient permitting processes discourage investment and innovation, limiting the ability of U.S. companies to lead in global space markets,” he stated in an Executive Order signed August 13.

The order directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to cut “outdated, redundant, or overly restrictive” rules that govern launch and reentry licenses. It also instructs the Federal Aviation Administration, which is housed under the DOT, to eliminate or accelerate environmental reviews, ease the path to building new spaceports, and to appoint a “senior executive” charged with fostering “innovation and deregulation.”

The Commerce Department also has been ordered to stand up a new process for authorizing “novel space activities,” like in-space manufacturing or satellite refueling, that don’t fit neatly into existing licensing regimes.

The executive order came the same day transportation secretary and acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy dismissed every member of the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee (COMSTAC), a long-standing industry advisory board inside the DOT that shapes spaceflight rules and priorities.

For companies that have spent years mired in environmental reviews and licensing delays, the order was a welcome sign that future bids would experience shorter timelines and more regulatory clarity. The Commercial Space Federation, an industry trade group whose members include SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, and a dozen others, applauded the executive order for providing “regulatory relief to unleash the U.S. commercial space industry.”

Indeed, commercial players are poised to gain a lot under this new regime. Launch companies could benefit from faster permitting and streamlined environmental reviews. State-backed spaceport operators, like Space Florida, may also be aided by provisions that accelerate new site development.

Creating a mission authorization framework for “novel” space activities is equally consequential: startups like Varda Space Industries or Orbit Fab, which are developing technologies to manufacture pharmaceuticals in space and in-orbit refueling, respectively, may gain an advantage by a regulatory approach led by Commerce.

Environmental rule sticking point

Not everyone is celebrating the order. The Center for Biological Diversity (CBD), an environmental group that has challenged the FAA’s approval of SpaceX’s Starship program in Texas, called the order “reckless.”

“Bending the knee to powerful corporations by allowing federal agencies to ignore bedrock environmental laws is incredibly dangerous and puts all of us in harm’s way. This is clearly not in the public interest,” senior attorney Jared Margolis said.

For groups like CBD, environmental reviews are not “overly complex,” as the Order charges — they are often completely insufficient. In 2023, environmental groups, including the CBD, alleged that the FAA’s environmental assessment of SpaceX’s South Texas plans were inadequate and in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act.

SpaceX has separately waged an increasingly public campaign against “superfluous” regulations and environmental analyses that have hindered a speedier test campaign.

The company sold its customer list to Turo in July and then turned right around and entered into a form of receivership in California, according to a notice that went out to Kyte creditors.

Kyte fell behind on some of its loans earlier this year, according to the notice. That caused the company’s top lender to repossess and liquidate Kyte’s vehicle fleet.

Kyte’s board of directors “pursued various capital solutions” to keep the company alive, the notice states. But the company wasn’t able to line up financing and the board voted to wind down Kyte.

While Kyte passed its customer list to Turo, a number of users who had prebooked trips before the shutdown have complained that they’re stuck waiting on refunds for hundreds of dollars.

Some who spoke to TechCrunch said they were able to get their credit card companies to perform a charge-back, while others have had no luck. Kyte CEO Nikolaus Volk told TechCrunch in a message that charge-backs may be the quickest way for customers to get that money back.

Founded in 2019, Kyte provided on-demand rental cars that it also delivered directly to customers’ homes. It controlled its own fleet of vehicles, making it a bit more like Zipcar and less like the peer-to-peer offerings of players like Turo. Kyte grew to 14 markets and raised more than $300 million in financing over its lifetime, and started billing itself as the “best competitor to Hertz.”

The business started coming apart in 2024, Volk told TechCrunch last year. Kyte was struggling to generate free cash flow in markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Volk said his team explored selling the business but decided to restructure and focus on reaching profit in the two biggest markets of San Francisco and New York City.

While the update largely rewrites the original text for simplicity’s sake, there are a few items that jump out in the new revision — notably how TikTok prioritizes its marketplace, how deeply it personalizes the experience per user, and a small change to the type of AI-generated content that’s permitted.

Today, social media companies have to comply with a range of regulations globally, like the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), and the U.S.’s TAKE IT DOWN Act, which in part has led to policy revisions on some platforms, as with yesterday’s update to Bluesky.

TikTok’s changes, which go live on September 13, 2025, are not as substantial, as it appears the company was often just rewriting text for clarity.

However, one section that saw several additions in the updated guidelines covers the rules for TikTok LIVE creators.

The company warns creators they’re responsible for anything that happens on their live session, even if it involves third-party tools, like real-time translation or voice-to-text tools to read out viewers’ comments. TikTok advises creators to monitor those tools to make sure they’re not violating the rules through these third-party services.

Another notable addition to this section introduces new guidelines for commercial content.

TikTok stresses that commercial content must be disclosed. It also directly states that it will reduce the visibility of content that directs users to “purchase products off-platform in markets where TikTok Shop is available.”

The company also says it’s customizing users’ search results.

While the prior version of the guidelines said TikTok provided “search suggestions” that were relevant to the user, the new guidelines say both “search results and recommendations may look different for everyone.” The guidelines explain that TikTok uses information like your past searches and what you’ve watched to make the search results more relevant.

The updated rules reveal that comments are personalized, too.

TikTok says comments are being sorted based on signals like past replies, likes, and reports. Again, this means the comment section will look different from user to user.

The section on AI content has not changed dramatically, though the language here has become less verbose in parts when describing what sort of deepfake content is not allowed. TikTok previously banned content that “shares or shows fake authoritative sources or crisis events, or falsely shows public figures in certain contexts,” it said. “This includes being bullied, making an endorsement, or being endorsed.”

That’s now been replaced with language that says TikTok doesn’t allow content “that’s misleading about matters of public importance or harmful to individuals.”

It’s interesting to note the language referencing AI endorsements was removed. (Perhaps TikTok is paving the way for celebrity-approved, AI-generated endorsements?)

In some cases, the language in the guidelines has been simplified, such as in the case of the For You feed (FYF) Eligibility Standards section, which no longer has a long list of what’s considered FYF ineligible content. Instead, details about the ineligible content are spread throughout the many different sections of the updated Community Guidelines, which makes it less helpful to reference since it’s no longer all in one place.

It’s also worth noting that TikTok changed the language explaining the reason why it engages in content moderation.

Before, the company said the process kept the platform “safe, trustworthy, and vibrant.” Now it describes content moderation as helping TikTok be a “safe, fun, and creative place for everyone.”

Luckily, modern technology exists, and more people are turning to apps like Bumble For Friends, Flox, and Timeleft to form new friendships quickly.

One app called Les Amis aims to stand out by targeting women, transgender, and LGBTQ+ individuals, primarily in the mid-20s to early 40s age demographic.

Les Amis uses AI to pair users with similar interests and encourages them to join local events offered within the app, such as pottery classes, book clubs, wine tastings, and Pilates.

Anna Bilych (ex-PayPal) created the app in 2022 alongside her co-founder, Oleg Pashinin (ex-Google AI), after struggling to rebuild her social circle after relocating.

Now the European-founded app is currently rolling out to U.S. markets. It launched in New York earlier this month.

Les Amis (French for “friends”) is designed to make it easy for users to connect with like-minded individuals in their area. It features a setup similar to dating apps, where users create profiles by selecting profile photos, writing a bio, and choosing from a list of interests, which include poetry, gardening, yoga, martial arts, and more.

The app includes an AI assistant named “Amis,” which aids in the matching process. Every two weeks, users can participate in matching rounds where the AI connects them with a potential friend based on shared interests. It also connects them to others in similar life stages — whether they’re single, married, a mother, new to town, or even looking to network with someone in a comparable career field.

The AI determines matches on Mondays, giving users ample time to chat and coordinate meetups later in the week.

Additionally, the app features an explore page for users to sign up for local events and experiences, such as workshops, social gatherings, and recreational activities. It also recently launched “Trips,” where users can travel in groups to destinations like Morocco, Iceland, and the Amalfi Coast.

The app operates on a membership-based business model, with fees that vary by city. For example, the monthly fee is $70 in New York and €55 in Amsterdam. The membership includes a flexible credit system to spend toward experiences, which can be spent in any city where Les Amis is available, enabling members to attend events while traveling.

Les Amis is available on iOS and Android devices across Europe, including Amsterdam, Barcelona, Berlin, Madrid, Milan, Munich, Paris, and Stockholm.

As for U.S. markets, the app was introduced in Austin last May, in addition to New York. Les Amis plans to expand to Boston next, followed by Washington, D.C., next month, and Miami in October. A launch in Los Angeles is also on the roadmap.

It’s important to note that there are currently no Les Amis events happening in New York, but they will soon launch on August 25. The app is still in the application acceptance phase and has received over 2,000 applications from users in New York.

In total, the app touts about 120,000 installs, and around 30,000 women have attended events to date.

Josh Hawley (R-MO) said he intends to investigate whether Meta’s generative AI products exploit, deceive, or harm children, after leaked internal documents showed the company’s chatbots were allowed to have “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children.

“Is there anything – ANYTHING – Big Tech won’t do for a quick buck?” Hawley wrote in a post on X announcing the investigation.

Hawley chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which he says will commence a probe into whether Meta’s tech harms children, and “whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards.”

Reuters broke the story after viewing the guidelines, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards.” The document noted, among other things, that chatbots were permitted to hold romantic conversations with an 8-year-old that said, “Every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.”

A Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch that such examples are inconsistent with Meta’s policies and have since been removed.

“It’s unacceptable that these policies were advanced in the first place,” Hawley wrote in a letter addressed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, saying that Meta acknowledged the veracity of the reports and “made retractions only after this alarming content came to light.”

“We intend to learn who approved these policies, how long they were in effect, and what Meta has done to stop this conduct going forward,” Hawley wrote.

Hawley has asked Meta to produce the guidelines, including every draft, redline, and final version, as well as lists of every product that adheres to those standards, other safety and incident reports, and the identities of individuals responsible for changing policy.

Meta has until September 19 to provide the information, the letter says.

Others have endorsed the investigation, including Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN).

“When it comes to protecting precious children online, Meta has failed miserably by every possible measure,” Blackburn told TechCrunch. “Even worse, the company has turned a blind eye to the devastating consequences of how its platforms are designed.

75,techcrunch.com,https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/15/how-your-solar-rooftop-became-a-national-security-issue/,How your solar rooftop became a national security issue,2025-08-15T00:00:00,"James Showalter describes a pretty specific if not entirely implausible nightmare scenario. Someone drives up to your house, cracks your Wi-Fi password, and then starts messing with the solar inverter mounted beside your garage. This unassuming gray box converts the direct current from your rooftop panels into the alternating current that powers your home.

“You’ve got to have a solar stalker” for this scenario to play out, says Showalter, describing the kind of person who would need to physically show up in your driveway with both the technical know-how and the motivation to hack your home energy system.

Showalter, the CEO of EG4 Electronics, a company based in Sulphur Springs, Texas, doesn’t consider this sequence of events particularly likely. Still, it’s why his company last week found itself in the spotlight when U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA published an advisory detailing security vulnerabilities in EG4’s solar inverters. The flaws, CISA noted, could allow an attacker with access to the same network as an affected inverter and its serial number to intercept data, install malicious firmware, or seize control of the whole system.

For the roughly 55,000 customers who own EG4’s affected inverter model, the episode probably felt like an unsettling introduction to a device that they little understand. What they’re learning is that modern solar inverters aren’t simple power converters anymore. They now serve as the backbone of home energy installations, monitoring performance, communicating with utility companies, and, when there’s excess power, feeding it back into the grid.

Much of this has happened without people noticing. “Nobody knew what the hell a solar inverter was five years ago,” observes Justin Pascale, a principal consultant at Dragos, a cybersecurity firm that specializes in industrial systems. “Now we’re talking about it at the national and international level.”

Security shortcomings and customers’ complaints

Some of the numbers highlight the degree to which individual homes in the U.S. are becoming miniature power plants. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, small-scale solar installations — primarily residential — grew more than fivefold between 2014 and 2022. What was once the province of climate advocates and early adopters became more mainstream owing to falling costs, government incentives, and a growing awareness of climate change.

Each solar installation adds another node to an expanding network of interconnected devices, each one contributing to energy independence but also becoming a potential entry point for someone with malicious intent.

When pressed about his company’s security standards, Showalter acknowledges its shortcomings, but he also deflects. “This is not an EG4 problem,” he says. “This is an industry-wide problem.” Over a Zoom call and later, in this editor’s inbox, he produced a 14-page report cataloguing 88 solar energy vulnerability disclosures across commercial and residential applications since 2019.

Not all of his customers — some of whom took to Reddit to complain — are sympathetic, particularly given that CISA’s advisory revealed fundamental design flaws: communication between monitoring applications and inverters that occurred in unencrypted plain text, firmware updates that lacked integrity checks, and rudimentary authentication procedures.

“These were fundamental security lapses,” says one customer of the company, who asked to speak anonymously. “Adding insult to injury,” continues this individual, “EG4 didn’t even bother to notify me or offer suggested mitigations.”

Asked why EG4 didn’t alert customers straightaway when CISA reached out to the company, Showalter calls it a “live and learn” moment.

“Because we’re so close [to addressing CISA’s concerns] and it’s such a positive relationship with CISA, we were going to get to the ‘done’ button, and then advise people, so we’re not in the middle of the cake being baked,” says Showalter.

TechCrunch reached out to CISA earlier this week for more information; the agency has not responded. In its advisory about EG4, CISA states that “no known public exploitation specifically targeting these vulnerabilities has been reported to CISA at this time.”

Connections to China spark security concerns

While unrelated, the timing of EG4’s public relations crisis coincides with broader anxieties about the supply chain security of renewable energy equipment.

Earlier this year, U.S. energy officials reportedly began reassessing risks posed by devices made in China after discovering unexplained communication equipment inside some inverters and batteries. According to a Reuters investigation, undocumented cellular radios and other communication devices were found in equipment from multiple Chinese suppliers — components that hadn’t appeared on official hardware lists.

This reported discovery carries particular weight given China’s dominance in solar manufacturing. That same Reuters story noted that Huawei is the world’s largest supplier of inverters, accounting for 29% of shipments globally in 2022, followed by Chinese peers Sungrow and Ginlong Solis. Some 200 GW of European solar power capacity is linked to inverters made in China, which is roughly equivalent to more than 200 nuclear power plants.



The geopolitical implications haven’t escaped notice. Lithuania last year passed a law blocking remote Chinese access to solar, wind, and battery installations above 100 kilowatts, effectively restricting the use of Chinese inverters. Showalter says his company is responding to customer concerns by similarly starting to move away from Chinese suppliers and toward components made by companies elsewhere, including in Germany.

But the vulnerabilities CISA described in EG4’s systems raise questions that extend beyond any single company’s practices or where it sources its components. The U.S. standards agency NIST warns that “if you remotely control a large enough number of home solar inverters, and do something nefarious at once, that could have catastrophic implications to the grid for a prolonged period of time.”

The good news (if there is any), is that while theoretically possible, this scenario faces a lot of practical limitations.

Pascale, who works with utility-scale solar installations, notes that residential inverters serve primarily two functions: converting power from direct to alternating current, and facilitating the connection back to the grid. A mass attack would require compromising vast numbers of individual homes simultaneously. (Such attacks are not impossible but are more likely to involve targeting the manufacturers themselves, some of which have remote access to their customers’ solar inverters, as evidenced by security researchers last year.)

The regulatory framework that governs larger installations does not right now extend to residential systems. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation’s Critical Infrastructure Protection standards currently apply only to larger facilities producing 75 megawatts or more, like solar farms.

Because residential installations fall so far below these thresholds, they operate in a regulatory gray zone where cybersecurity standards remain suggestions rather than requirements.

But the end result is that the security of thousands of small installations depends largely on the discretion of individual manufacturers that are operating in a regulatory vacuum.

On the issue of unencrypted data transmission, for example, which is one reason EG4 received that slap on the hand from CISA, Pascale notes that in utility-scale operational environments, plain text transmission is common and sometimes encouraged for network-monitoring purposes.

“When you look at encryption in an enterprise environment, it is not allowed,” he explains. “But when you look at an operational environment, most things are transmitted in plain text.”

Put another way, the real concern isn’t an immediate threat to individual homeowners. Instead it ties to the aggregate vulnerability of a rapidly expanding network. As the energy grid becomes increasingly distributed, with power flowing from millions of small sources rather than dozens of large ones, the attack surface expands exponentially. Each inverter represents a potential pressure point in a system that was never designed to accommodate this level of complexity.

Showalter has embraced CISA’s intervention as what he calls a “trust upgrade” — an opportunity to differentiate his company in a crowded market. He says that since June, EG4 has worked with the agency to address the identified vulnerabilities, reducing an initial list of 10 concerns to three remaining items that the company expects to resolve by October. The process has involved updating firmware transmission protocols, implementing additional identity verification for technical support calls, and redesigning authentication procedures.

But for those like the anonymous EG4 customer who spoke with frustration about the company’s response, the episode highlights the odd position that solar adopters find themselves in.

As I make small talk with other reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman jumps through the door on my left. Altman’s looking down at his bare iPhone to show us all something, and an intrusive thought slips out of my mouth: “No phone case is a bold choice.”

Of course, I immediately realize that the billionaire CEO of OpenAI, who employs Apple veteran Jony Ive, cares more about preserving the iPhone’s original design than the $1,000 it costs to replace one.

“Listen, we’re going to ship a device that is going to be so beautiful,” said Altman, referring to OpenAI and Ive’s forthcoming AI device. “If you put a case over it, I will personally hunt you down,” he joked.

Altman had gathered roughly a dozen tech reporters to join him and other OpenAI executives for an on-the-record dinner (and off-the-record dessert). The night raised more questions than it answered.

For instance, why is Nick Turley, the VP of ChatGPT, kindly passing me a lamb skewer just a week after launching GPT-5? Was this to make me write nice things about OpenAI’s biggest AI model launch yet, which was relatively disappointing given the years of hype around it?

Unlike GPT-4, which far outpaced rivals and challenged expectations of what AI can do, GPT-5 performs roughly on par with models from Google and Anthropic. OpenAI even brought back GPT-4o and ChatGPT’s model picker, after several users expressed concerns over GPT-5’s tone and its model router.

But throughout the night, it became clear to me that this dinner was about OpenAI’s future beyond GPT-5. OpenAI’s executives gave the impression that AI model launches are less important than they were when GPT-4 launched in 2023. After all, OpenAI is a very different company now, focused on upending legacy players in search, consumer hardware, and enterprise software.

OpenAI shared some new details about those efforts.

Altman said OpenAI’s incoming CEO of applications, Fidji Simo, would oversee multiple consumer apps outside of ChatGPT — ones OpenAI has yet to launch. Simo is slated to start work at OpenAI in just a few weeks, and she might end up overseeing the launch of an AI-powered browser that OpenAI is reportedly developing to compete with Chrome.

Altman suggested OpenAI would even consider buying Chrome — likely an offer that would be taken more seriously than Perplexity’s bid — should it become available. “If Chrome is really going to sell, we should take a look at it,” he said before looking at all of us and asking: “Is it actually going to sell? I assumed it wasn’t gonna happen.”



Simo also might end up running an AI-powered social media app — something the OpenAI CEO said he’s interested in exploring. In fact, Altman says there’s “nothing” inspiring to him about the way AI is used on social media today, adding that he’s interested in “whether or not it is possible to build a much cooler kind of social experience with AI.”

While Turley and Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s COO, largely gave the floor to Altman, drinking wine alongside the other seated guests, Altman also confirmed reports that OpenAI plans to back a brain-computer interface startup, Merge Labs, to compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink. (“We have not done that deal yet; I would like us to.”)

How intertwined that company will be with OpenAI’s models and devices remains to be seen. Altman described it only as a “a company that we’d invest in.”

In light of GPT-5’s bumpy rollout, Turley and Altman say they’ve learned a lot from the experience.

“I legitimately just thought we screwed that up,” said Altman on deprecating GPT-4o without telling users. Altman says OpenAI will give users a more clear “transition period” when deprecating AI models in the future.

Turley also said OpenAI is already rolling out a new update to make GPT-5’s responses “warmer,” but not sycophantic, such that it won’t reinforce negative behaviors in users.

“GPT-5 was just very to the point. I like that. I use the robot personality — I’m German, you know, whatever,” said Turley. “But many people do not, and they really like the fact that ChatGPT would actually check in with you.”

It’s a delicate balance for OpenAI to strike, especially given that some users have developed dependencies on ChatGPT. Altman said OpenAI believes that less than 1% of ChatGPT users have unhealthy relationships — which could still be tens of millions of people.

Turley said OpenAI worked with mental health experts to develop a rubric to evaluate GPT-5’s answers, ensuring that the AI model will push back on unhealthy behaviors.

That said, it seems that GPT-5 hasn’t hurt OpenAI’s business. In fact, Altman said OpenAI’s API traffic doubled within 48 hours of GPT-5’s launch, and the company is effectively “out of GPUs” thanks to all the demand.

Given OpenAI’s bets on browsers, brain chips, AI chatbots — and others the company is making around data centers, robotics, and energy — Altman clearly has ambitions of running a much bigger company than just the ChatGPT maker. The final form could look something like Google’s parent Alphabet, but perhaps even broader.

In the coming years, it seems likely that OpenAI will go public to meet its massive capital demands. In preparation for that, I think Altman wants to hone his relationship with the media. However, I think OpenAI also wants to get to a place where it’s no longer defined by its best AI model.",,"Maxwell Zeff, Senior Ai Reporter, Sarah Perez, Aria Alamalhodaei, Zack Whittaker, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, --C-Author-Card-Image-Size Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var, Media, Min-Width","gpt5, openai, rolls, chatgpt, tech, model, sam, life, altman, bread, openais, users, company, explores, disrupt, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:50:09.403900+00:00,4e636bfed5f4746de10127d8078534868c9d10034cf624360e047ef7b85d0aa6

Since launching in May 2023, ChatGPT’s app for iOS and Android devices has reached $2 billion in global consumer spending, according to a new analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures. That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT’s rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates.

So far this year, ChatGPT’s mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year.

That’s significantly higher — or about 53x higher — than ChatGPT’s next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok’s average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT’s.

This data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT’s dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don’t provide a complete picture of the AI companies’ overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like via their APIs.

Rather, this new data offers a window into the apps’ traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores.

It’s also worth noting that when xAI’s Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn’t initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early January 2025 and has been on Google Play since March 4.

Still, ChatGPT’s lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude’s $2.55, Grok’s $0.75, and Copilot’s $0.28, Appfigures found.

In the U.S., ChatGPT’s spending per download to date is even higher, at $10, leading the market to account for 38% of the app’s revenue to date. Germany is the second-largest market, accounting for 5.3% of ChatGPT’s lifetime total spending.

ChatGPT’s lead can also be seen in terms of downloads. To date, the app has been installed an estimated 690 million times globally, compared with Grok’s 39.5 million. (That puts X owner Elon Musk’s recent complaints about the App Store’s alleged favoritism of ChatGPT in its Top Charts into better context.)

Average monthly downloads of ChatGPT globally are now at approximately 45 million, up 180% from about 16 million in January through July of 2024.

In 2025 so far, ChatGPT’s app has been downloaded 318 million times, or 2.8x more than the 113 million it saw during the same period last year. By the number of installs, however, India is the top market, accounting for 13.7% of lifetime downloads, compared with second place, the U.S., which accounted for 10.3% of all downloads.",,"Sarah Perez, Consumer News Editor, Maxwell Zeff, Aria Alamalhodaei, Zack Whittaker, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, --C-Author-Card-Image-Size Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var, Media, Min-Width","million, install, app, grok, generated, date, earns, spending, chatgpts, 2b, 291, lifetime, downloads, ai, mobile",pending,2025-08-15T23:50:05.088565+00:00,3b2284d4fa4fe11430c70cbba269bb13c47ad385d6817bf7d1f553fa2f2267b7

The lawsuit, filed on Thursday by Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox “has and continues to facilitate the distribution of child sexual abuse material and the sexual exploitation of Louisiana’s children.” It also accuses the platform of purposely not rolling out basic safety controls to protect children from predators and failing to notify parents of risks.

Roblox, which launched in 2006, has 82 million daily active users. The lawsuit notes that 20% of these users are under the age of 8, whereas another 20% are between the ages of 9 and 12.

“Due to Roblox’s lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana,” Murrill said in a statement. “Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”

According to the lawsuit, adults can pose as children on Roblox, and children can bypass age requirements to access experiences meant for older users.

The lawsuit points to several sexually explicit experiences that were on the platform, including “Escape to Epstein Island,” “Diddy Party,” and “Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe.”

A spokesperson for Roblox said that while the company can’t comment on pending litigation, the platform dedicates “substantial resources, including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior, including attempts to direct users off platform, where safety standards and moderation may be less stringent than ours.”

“While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous technology and enforcement safeguards, including restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing,” the spokesperson said. “The safety of our community is a top priority.”

Last year, Roblox launched a number of safety measures to protect children on its platform, including barring users under the age of 13 from sending direct messages. The measures were implemented following reports that Roblox was exposing young users to dangerous risks, such as grooming and explicit content.

Murrill’s lawsuit states that Roblox’s recent safety measures were implemented too late and are inadequate.

The lawsuit seeks permanent injunctive relief, prohibiting the company from claiming that it has adequate safety features and from engaging in any activity that would violate the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Thanks to the acquisition, the company is launching a new plug-in for the Ultrahuman Ring AIR called “Cycle and Ovulation Pro.” The plug-in will allow users to accurately track their cycles, get fertility planning support with ovulation confirmation, and detect patterns like early or late ovulation. The plug-in also allows users to log moods, symptoms, and more to uncover long-term wellness trends.

Cycle and Ovulation Pro use a temperature-sensing algorithm originally developed for viO’s OvuSense fertility monitors. The technology was developed over 15 years and trained on a dataset of over 260,000 cycles collected with medical-grade sensors, Ultrahuman notes.

With the Ultrahuman Ring AIR, the technology enables cycle tracking via the finger to allow for personalized insights that adapt over time and a better understanding of users’ cycles.

“Most menstrual tracking platforms are built for women with regular 28-day cycles,” Ultrahuman wrote in a press release. “In reality, the majority have diverse cycle patterns — and those with conditions like non-bleeding, PCOS, endometriosis, or thyroid disorders often don’t get an accurate or supportive experience. Ultrahuman’s acquisition of viO is designed for them.”

Ultrahuman notes that the existing free Cycle & Ovulation PowerPlug, which offers foundational tracking tools and calendar-based predictions, will remain available.

“Wearables will shape the future of health,” said Rob Milnes, CEO of viO HealthTech, in a press release. “We’re delighted to be able to bring OvuSense women’s health insights to a significantly wider audience via the Ultrahuman Ring AIR.”

演習に関わった複数の関係者は、レッド・チーミングの結果を公表していれば、AIコミュニティにとって有益だったとの見解を示している。

「もし報告書が公開されていれば、レッド・チーミングの現場で（NISTの）リスクフレームワークのうち何が有用で何が適用できないのかを、ほかの専門家たちも学べたはずです」と、演習に参加したカーネギーメロン大学博士課程のアリス・チェン・ジャンは語る。また、AIツールを実際にテストしながら、その開発者たちと直接対話できた点が特に有意義だったと、チェン・ジャンは振り返った。

ほかの関係者は、AIモデルが核・生物・化学（NBC）兵器の開発に悪用されるリスクといった国家安全保障上の懸念が高まったことや、米政府が大手テック企業とのより緊密な関係を求めたことで、報告書が埋もれた可能性があると考えている。

Other common words make their appearance as one looks down the list. ""Dog"" (275 languages) tops ""cat"" (273). Jesus (274) beats ""Adolf Hitler"" (242).

But if you had looked at the list a couple months back, something would have been different. Turkey, the US, and Japan were still in the same order near the top of the leaderboard, but the number one slot was occupied by an unlikely contender: David Woodard, who had Wikipedia entries in 335 different languages.

You... haven't heard of David Woodard?

Woodard is a composer who infamously wrote a ""prequiem""—that is, a ""pre requiem""—in 2001 for Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, who had murdered 168 people with a truck bomb. The piece was to be performed at a church near McVeigh's execution site in Terre Haute, Indiana, then recorded and played on the radio so that McVeigh would have a chance to hear it.

According to the LA Times, which spoke to the composer, ""Woodard’s hope in performing the 12-minute piece, he said, is to 'cause the soul of Timothy McVeigh to go to heaven.'"" According to BBC coverage from the time, Woodard ""says McVeigh is '33 and nearly universally despised at the time of his execution'—like Jesus Christ.""",,,"history, timothy, woodard, wikipedias, wikipedia, list, selfpromotion, piece, different, number, tops, exposes, dedicated, operation, single, mcveigh, largest, entries, volunteer",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:49.208653+00:00,2f075d987c59709ce3d6dc03fdf2d0880ba20a2c829eaefe87ff87cedbfaf44c

フードテック・スタートアップの場合、そのプロダクトのおいしさはもちろんのこと、原料は何か、安全性、健康への効果や、社会的意義を含め、あらゆる価値を伝えなければならない。その意味では、1社で食品スーパーやコンビニに乗り込んで膨大な棚の中に埋もれるよりも、同じビジョンを共有する知名度の高い企業のオフィスに採用してもらい、その企業のなかでストーリーを伝え、社員たちからフィードバックを得る方が効率的だ。

例えば、スタートアップAll in Food（旧This Saves Lives）は、栄養価の高いスナックバーを販売しているが、売上の2%が食へのアクセスが困難な人々を救う活動に寄付される。この課題解決に挑む活動家を表彰し、そのストーリーを伝えることで自社の製品を世に広めようとしているのだ。こうした商品は、通常のスーパーの店舗ではその価値を伝えづらい。

All in Foodはグーグル各オフィスでバー製品を採用してもらうことに成功した。マウンテンビュー本社では専用のミニサイズバーを提供するなど試験的な導入から始まり、その後ロサンゼルスやアトランタなど他オフィスにも展開された。環境対応や健康志向などグーグルのニーズに合わせ商品設計を調整したという。グーグルでは定期的なスナックローテーションにより現在は本社で提供が終了したものの「味と品質に厳しいグーグルが選んだ」という信用力を得て、All in Foodは他社営業時にこの実績をアピールできるようになった。All in Foodにとって、グーグル・オフィスは格好のMVEの場所となったのだ。

フードイノベーションを推進するオフィス

MVEの一端を担うグーグルだが、スタートアップからの売込みをただ待っているわけではない。記事によれば、オフィスのカフェテリアの食を担う食品サービス会社Guckenheimerでグーグルを担当するコルガン・キーンリーは、フード関連のカンファレンスに足を運び、食のトレンドや食の抱える社会課題をモニタリングしている。

Copycats Are Proving Hard to Kill,2025-08-14T21:23:50.978000+00:00,"Getting clones taken down can be an exhausting process for developers. Small studios have less time, energy, and resources to dedicate to this process, and they’re at the whims of the digital distribution platforms these games exist on.

Wren Brier, Unpacking’s creative director, says that since the game’s release in 2021, developer Witch Beam has reported more than 80 clones. “It feels like whack-a-mole sometimes,” Brier says. These are games that are not just similar in nature but “blatant copyright infringements” that lift the game’s assets or even its name. “The majority have been extremely low-effort scams using Unpacking's name or imagery to trick players into downloading something that isn't even a game, just a series of ads,” she says.

When it comes to many AI-made clones, Brier says there’s a misconception about what that means. “They're not AI-made games, they're AI-generated marketing images attached to a completely unrelated, hastily slapped-together, bare-bones skeleton of a game,” she says. “They are literally a scam: They are trying to trick players into buying a crappy product by using misleading imagery and by pretending to be a real game that the player might have heard of.”

Clones don’t always threaten a developer’s profits—Aggro Crab is confident about its bank account, thanks to Peak’s massive success—but the damage can be widespread in other ways. Brier says that AI-clones hurt developers the same way AI books hurt authors: “Flooding a storefront with garbage that no one wants to play makes it impossible for players to organically discover indie games.” Game certification, the process of getting onto a platform, used to be stricter.

“It's not a problem just for the games that get cloned,” Brier says. “It's a problem for all of us.”

For developers, there aren’t many options to fight clones, regardless of how they’re made. Intellectual property attorney Kirk Sigmon says clones are already difficult to tackle legally; copyright protection doesn’t extend to a genre, aesthetic, or even gameplay mechanics. AI “definitely makes slop generation faster, but the issue has been around for well over two decades,” he says. “All that’s really happened is that the bar has moved ever so slightly lower for new entrants, because you can make an AI model pump out stuff for you faster.”

The easiest case for copyright infringement typically happens when a cloner lifts work from the game directly—as happened with Unpacking. “It’s not uncommon for knockoff games to accidentally (or intentionally) copy assets from the game they are knocking off,” Sigmon says.

In fact, he says, AI-generated games might actually be better protected from copyright infringement lawsuits. “After all, if knockoff developers are savvy, they’ll use AI models to develop unique assets/code rather than steal it from another game or just download it from some random Internet source,” he says. “That’ll make it much harder to go after them in court, for better or worse.”

Platforms ultimately hold the power when it comes to ridding a storefront of clones, though smaller developers bear the brunt of the work in filing a report and sorting out who to talk to. Sometimes that process is quick and wraps in a few days; sometimes it can take weeks. Social pressure may be the best defense a developer has. Sigmon says that complaining to storefronts or enlisting fans are workable solutions. “I don’t know many gamers who are a fan of half-hearted slop games,” he says.

Aggro Crab and Landfall are taking this route. “We're not really the type to be litigious,” says Kaman, the cofounder. Instead, they’re being outspoken in their distaste. In early August, the company posted on X, in reference to one copycat, that it would rather users “pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled [Roblox] slop ripoff.” Landfall tweeted that the company has “been reporting a bunch of these AI slop things” in response to a screenshot of the game Peaked Climbing. It was available on the PlayStation Store before being removed; Peak was released only on PC. WIRED has reached out to PlayStation, Roblox, and Steam and will update accordingly.

“I consume media because it's made by humans,” Kaman says. “I want to experience a piece of art, whatever it may be, another human has made and get their perspective and their outlook on the world. If AI is used to make the game, then you're removing that from the equation. There's no value in it.”

The Supreme Court will let Mississippi’s social media age verification law take effect while the case is being argued in court. In an unsigned ruling on Thursday, the court declined to block the law after an emergency petition from trade association NetChoice. The order offers no explanation, but in a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the law was “likely unconstitutional” — but that NetChoice hadn’t “sufficiently demonstrated” a risk of harm.

The law, HB 1126, requires social media platforms to verify the age of the person creating the account, while blocking users under 18 unless they have permission from a parent. It also states that social media sites must protect underage users from “harmful material” — such as sexual content and material related to self-harm — as well as restrict data collection.

NetChoice, which is backed by tech giants like Meta, Google, Amazon, Reddit, and Discord, argues that age verification laws for general-purpose social media violate the First Amendment. Though the trade association won an injunction to block the law last year, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated it in April, allowing the law to go into effect. As Justice Kavanaugh noted, however, numerous district courts have blocked similar laws in other states.

“To be clear, NetChoice has, in my view, demonstrated that it is likely to succeed on the merits — namely, that enforcement of the Mississippi law would likely violate its members’ First Amendment rights.”

Despite this setback, NetChoice is still confident that it will prevail. “Although we’re disappointed with the Court’s decision, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence makes clear that NetChoice will ultimately succeed in defending the First Amendment — not just in this case but across all NetChoice’s ID-for-Speech lawsuits,” Paul Taske, co-director of the NetChoice Litigation Center, said in a statement. “This is merely an unfortunate procedural delay.”

The decision comes as lawmakers across the US — and around the world — push age verification mandates designed to protect children from harmful content on the internet. In June, the Supreme Court upheld a Texas law that requires users to verify their ages before accessing porn sites, paving the way for similar laws to take effect — but specifically for platforms focused on adult content. Meanwhile, the UK has begun to enforce a broader online age-gating requirement that asks users to verify their age with a government ID, a face scan, or by entering credit card information on certain websites.

Jennifer Huddleston, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, said in a statement that age verification laws have “significant impacts on privacy and speech rights of both adult and teen users.” Huddleston notes that today’s decision doesn’t mean the court “will automatically uphold this law as constitutional should it reach it through the full appeals process.”",,Emma Roth,"opens, agegating, court, age, verification, users, door, verify, supreme, law, laws, media, social, netchoice",pending,2025-08-15T23:52:34.447448+00:00,ddb783da6dfdd08593cb8cd78be2944c099b046e08c9ef12cab288fb13b50aef

Despite the scandal, xAI announced that its products would soon be available for federal workers to purchase through the General Services Administration. At the time, xAI claimed this was an ""important milestone"" for its government business.

But Wired reviewed emails and spoke to government insiders, which revealed that GSA leaders abruptly decided to drop xAI's Grok from their contract offering. That decision to pull the plug came after leadership allegedly rushed staff to make Grok available as soon as possible following a persuasive sales meeting with xAI in June.

It's unclear what exactly caused the GSA to reverse course, but two sources told Wired that they ""believe xAI was pulled because of Grok’s antisemitic tirade.""

As of this writing, xAI's ""Grok for Government"" website has not been updated to reflect GSA's supposed removal of Grok from an offering that xAI noted would have allowed ""every federal government department, agency, or office, to access xAI's frontier AI products.""

xAI did not respond to Ars' request to comment and so far has not confirmed that the GSA offering is off the table. If Wired's report is accurate, GSA's decision also seemingly did not influence the military's decision to move forward with a $200 million xAI contract the US Department of Defense granted last month.

Government’s go-to tools will come from xAI’s rivals

If Grok is cut from the contract, that would suggest that Grok's meltdown came at perhaps the worst possible moment for xAI, which is building the ""world's biggest supercomputer"" as fast as it can to try to get ahead of its biggest AI rivals.

Grok seemingly had the potential to become a more widely used tool if federal workers opted for xAI's models. Through Donald Trump's AI Action Plan, the president has similarly emphasized speed, pushing for federal workers to adopt AI as quickly as possible. Although xAI may no longer be involved in that broad push, other AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have partnered with the government to help Trump pull that off and stand to benefit long-term if their tools become entrenched in certain agencies.",,,"federal, offering, mechahitler, xai, possible, gsa, grok, workers, contract, report, agency, drops, backlash, xais, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:52.263882+00:00,19880c0db5a8921bec3f639d2b41ff6558469552a015d856eea62fd45f02f6dc

SpaceX is already in line to win over $3 million in grant money in the state but is seeking $60 million.

Starlink is poised to benefit from the Trump administration rewriting rules for the $42 billion Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) grant program. While the Biden administration decided that states should prioritize fiber in order to build more future-proof networks, the Trump administration ordered states to revise their plans with a ""tech-neutral approach"" and lower the average cost of serving each location.

With the Trump administration backing its attempt to obtain more federal funding for Starlink, SpaceX is likely to object to state plans that still include significant fiber builds. That's what happened yesterday when SpaceX filed comments on Virginia's final proposal, which will be reviewed by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

The Virginia plan ""represents a massive waste of federal taxpayer money, reverting to the Biden Administration's failed approach to BEAD and completely disregarding the Trump Administration's effort to restructure the program to accelerate broadband deployment and reduce spending,"" SpaceX alleged. ""Simply put, Virginia has put its heavy thumb on the scale in favor of expensive, slow-to-build fiber bias over speedy, low-cost, and technology neutral competition.""

SpaceX urged the NTIA to deny Virginia's proposal. Such an outcome could result in a dispute between the Trump administration and Virginia, which is led by a Republican governor who touted the state's broadband plan in an announcement last week.

But tiny AI matters, too. Google has announced a tiny version of its Gemma open model designed to run on local devices. Google says the new Gemma 3 270M can be tuned in a snap and maintains robust performance despite its small footprint.

Google released its first Gemma 3 open models earlier this year, featuring between 1 billion and 27 billion parameters. In generative AI, the parameters are the learned variables that control how the model processes inputs to estimate output tokens. Generally, the more parameters in a model, the better it performs. With just 270 million parameters, the new Gemma 3 can run on devices like smartphones or even entirely inside a web browser.

Running an AI model locally has numerous benefits, including enhanced privacy and lower latency. Gemma 3 270M was designed with these kinds of use cases in mind. In testing with a Pixel 9 Pro, the new Gemma was able to run 25 conversations on the Tensor G4 chip and use just 0.75 percent of the device's battery. That makes it by far the most efficient Gemma model.

Developers shouldn't expect the same performance level of a multi-billion-parameter model, but Gemma 3 270M has its uses. Google used the IFEval benchmark, which tests a model's ability to follow instructions, to show that its new model punches above its weight. Gemma 3 270M hits a score of 51.2 percent in this test, which is higher than other lightweight models that have more parameters. The new Gemma falls predictably short of 1 billion-plus models like Llama 3.2, but it gets closer than you might think for having just a fraction of the parameters.",,,"releases, small, models, google, model, parameters, pintsize, run, open, 270m, gemma, devices, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:54.674818+00:00,c49a50d3ea5dbd0757ec1a8f793ec2dd142f1d9c754d614e8ac57444ab23279d

Earlier this week, Trump said he would allow the company to continue selling its H20 chips to China in exchange for a 15 percent share of the revenues.

“The H20 is obsolete. You know, it’s one of those things, but it still has a market,” Trump said at a press conference on Monday. “So we negotiated a little deal.”

The unusual and legally dubious arrangement is a striking reversal for the Trump administration, which banned all H20 sales to China earlier this year. The president reportedly changed his mind about the issue after meeting with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has argued that allowing Chinese companies to buy H20s doesn’t pose a risk to US national security.

On one hand, this is a simple story about a president who appears to have been influenced by a powerful executive lobbying in his company’s interest. But beneath the surface, there’s a much more interesting and complicated saga about how we got here.

Nvidia introduced the H20 last year after the US government banned the company from selling a more powerful chip, the H800, to China. The move was part of an ambitious project orchestrated by Biden administration officials who believed the United States needed to prevent China from developing advanced artificial intelligence first.

For the past few months, I’ve been working closely with Graham Webster, a researcher at Stanford University who sought to understand how and why the Biden team decided the US needed to curb China’s access to advanced semiconductors in the first place. Today, WIRED is publishing Graham’s definitive account of what really happened behind the scenes, based on interviews with more than 10 former US officials and policy experts, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity.

“I did this piece because the official legal justification for the controls, military and human rights, was obviously never the whole story,” Graham told me. “Clearly AI was in the mix, and I wanted to understand why in some depth.”

Graham writes that several key officials in Biden’s White House and Commerce Department “believed AI was approaching an inflection point—or several—that could give a nation major military and economic advantages. Some believed a self-improving system or so-called artificial general intelligence could be just over the technical horizon. The risk that China could reach these thresholds first was too great to ignore.”

So the Biden team decided to take action. In the fall of 2022, they unveiled broad export controls aimed at preventing China from accessing the most advanced chips required for training powerful AI systems, as well as specialized equipment Beijing needed to modernize its own domestic chipmaking industry.

The move was the start of a multi-year project that “would reshape relations between the world’s two largest powers and alter the course of what may be one of the most consequential technologies in generations,” Graham writes.

What struck me about Graham’s story is just how many people involved in Biden’s export control policies moved on to other influential positions in the world of AI, computing, and national security.

MicroSD cards are tiny but slow; the M.2 storage sticks in your PC are blazing fast but bigger and fully enclosed. Now, a new type of SSD out of China could be the best of both worlds — and it’s already set to appear in two cutting-edge gaming portables.

Chinese storage manufacturer Biwin is calling it the “Mini SSD,” though another manufacturer refers to it as the “1517”; it measures just 15mm x 17mm x 1.4mm thick, smaller than a U.S. penny and just slightly larger than MicroSD. Despite that, it offers maximum sequential read speeds of 3,700 megabytes per second (or 3,400MB/s writes) over a PCIe 4x2 connection, and offers 512GB, 1TB and 2TB capacities.

Image via GPD Image via GPD

To put that in context, the new MicroSD Express cards that work with the Nintendo Switch 2 top out at a theoretical 985MB/s, less than a third the speed. And while a full-size SD Express card could theoretically beat Mini SSD at 3,940MB/s, it would be nearly twice the size of Biwin’s creation.

The nano-SIMs used in recent smartphones are still smaller, though, and M.2 drives are still faster. I whipped up a quick chart so you can easily compare various storage cards and SIMs:

Type Length Width Height Theoretical max speed Mini SSD 15mm 17mm 1.4mm 3,700MB/s MicroSD 11mm 15mm 1mm 985MB/s SD 24mm 32mm ~2mm (varies) 3,940MB/s M.2 2230 22mm 30mm ~2mm (varies) ~8,000MB/s M.2 2280 22mm 80mm ~2mm (varies) ~14,000MB/s Nano-SIM 8.8mm 12.3mm 0.67mm N/A Micro-SIM 12mm 15mm 0.76mm N/A Mini-SIM 15mm 25mm 0.76mm N/A

It’s not clear if Biwin’s Mini SSD is a true standard that other storage makers can easily adopt. But the company’s marketing it for laptops, tablets, phones, cameras and more, with its own dedicated slot that works exactly like smartphone SIM card slots: stick in a pin to remove the tray.

The company claims IP68 water and dust resistance, which could be handy for phones in particular, and three-meter drop resistance.

Two cutting-edge Chinese gaming portables already appear to be customers, both of which made announcements at ChinaJoy this past week. There’s the GPD Win 5, the monster battery backpack wielding Strix Halo handheld we told you about in July, which you can see with the new SSD in the video atop this story.

OneNetbook’s upcoming OneXPlayer Super X hybrid laptop/tablet, which has the same Strix Halo chip, is also now advertising a dedicated “card slot” for a mini SSD.

It was 2021, and the outspoken New Jersey native thought he had finally left public service behind. After more than three decades at the Pentagon, he had left and taken a job in consulting. He wasn’t sure if he was ready to go back.

Could he be tempted by the opportunity to help oversee the tens of billions of dollars in semiconductor funding the administration was seeking from Congress? “I came from DOD,” he recalls saying. “$50 billion is OK money, but it’s not a lot of money.” Then Raimondo appealed to his sense of service. Estevez gave in and took the job.

By the time Estevez was sworn in as under secretary of commerce for industry and security in the spring of 2022, he had his work cut out for him. The role he had accepted would turn out to be at the center of America’s first serious effort to confront the geopolitical risks of artificial intelligence. Within a few years, the project would reshape relations between the world’s two largest powers and alter the course of what may be one of the most consequential technologies in generations.

Shortly after he joined the Commerce Department, Estevez says, he began hearing from officials in the White House. Over breakfast one morning, Tarun Chhabra and Jason Matheny, two key figures working on technology and national security, told Estevez they were planning something big, and they would be needing his help.

Over the next six months, the US government revolutionized its strategy for competing with China, now widely considered the nation’s most important technological rival. For years, US officials had sought to keep China one or two generations behind in semiconductors, the building blocks of modern technology that power everything from smartphones to AI. But now, as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan declared that September, “we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.”

On October 7, 2022, the Biden administration announced a sweeping set of export controls designed to cut off China from the most advanced chips used for training powerful AI models, as well as specialized tools that China would need to upgrade its own lagging chipmaking industry. Officially, the controls were intended to throttle China’s military modernization and stem human rights abuses fueled by surveillance technology. But as observers digested the dozens of pages of technical specifications and legalese, it became clear that the implications of the new policy were far more vast.

In practice, the United States was delivering a targeted blow that would ripple out across the Chinese economy, impacting research and development in every industry and scientific field that relied on computationally intensive machine learning. Anywhere cutting-edge AI or high-performance computing held promise—futuristic weapons, yes, but also curing disease and modeling climate change—the policy could undermine China.

On Wednesday, the Office of the Chief Information Officer at the Office of Management and Budget hosted a video call to discuss an AI tool being used to cut federal regulations, which the office called SweetREX Deregulation AI. The tool, which is still being developed, is built to identify sections of regulations that aren’t required by statute, then expedite the process for adopting updated regulations.

The development and rollout of what is being formally called the SweetREX Deregulation AI Plan Builder, or SweetREX DAIP, is meant to help achieve the goals laid out in President Donald Trump’s “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation” executive order, which aims to “promote prudent financial management and alleviate unnecessary regulatory burdens.” Industrial-scale deregulation is a core aim laid out in Project 2025, the document that has served as a playbook for the second Trump administration. The so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has also estimated that “50 percent of all federal regulations can be eliminated,” according to a July 1, 2025, PowerPoint presentation obtained by The Washington Post.

To this end, SweetREX was developed by associates of DOGE operating out of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The plan is to roll it out to other US agencies. Members of the call included staffers from across the government, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of State, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, among others.

Christopher Sweet, a DOGE affiliate who was initially introduced to colleagues as a “special assistant” and who was until recently a third-year student at the University of Chicago, co-led the call and was identified as the primary developer of SweetREX (thus, its name). He told colleagues that tools from Anthropic and OpenAI will be increasingly utilized by federal workers and that “a lot of the productivity boosts will come from the tools that are built around these platforms.” Sweet said that for SweetREX, they are “primarily using the Google family of models, so primarily Gemini.”

Neither Sweet nor OMB immediately responded to WIRED's request for comment. HUD's press office responded only to say the request was “under review.” Google did not yet respond to a request for comment.

Previously, WIRED reported on the output of an AI tool for deregulation at HUD. A spreadsheet detailed how many words could be eliminated from individual regulations and gave a percentage figure indicating how noncompliant the regulations were; how that percentage was calculated was unclear. At the time, Sweet did not respond to a request for comment, and a HUD spokesperson said the agency does not comment on individual personnel.

Leading Wednesday's call alongside Sweet was Scott Langmack, a DOGE-affiliated senior adviser at HUD and, according to his LinkedIn profile, the COO of technology company Kukun. (WIRED previously reported that he had application-level access to critical HUD systems; Kukun is a proptech firm that is, according to its website, “on a long-term mission to aggregate the hardest to find data.”) While Sweet led the development side of SweetREX, Langmack said he was taking point on demoing the tool for different agencies and pitching them on its benefits. He claimed, for example, that the tool is capable of reducing the time spent reviewing and proposing edited regulations from months to just a few hours or days.",,"Andrew Couts, Will Knight, Zoë Schiffer, Kate Knibbs, Guthrie Scrimgeour, Kylie Robison, Reece Rogers, Makena Kelly, Lauren Goode, Wired Staff","deregulation, doge, hud, regulations, called, coming, federal, sweetrex, slash, ai, sweet, request, regulation, tool, office",pending,2025-08-16T13:29:44.647707+00:00,ad6aca34fe69ea4751c099b8a71bfa29a10f3eb8cb2a069d73f97926a6e170e3

Airbnb has introduced a new “reserve now, pay later” option that lets users in the US book a reservation without paying right away. Instead, users can put off their payment to a later date before check-in.

Airbnb says it will require payment before the end of a stay’s free cancellation period, ensuring “hosts have time to secure another booking even if a guest cancels.” The option is only available for stays in the US with a moderate or flexible cancellation policy. Airbnb also notes that it will still charge upfront for travel insurance, climate contribution, or other optional add-ons.

While Airbnb already offers a “pay part now, pay later” option, which allows users to pay part of their bill at checkout and the rest before check-in, this new method means users don’t have to make a payment at the time of booking at all.

Then Grok Praised Hitler,2025-08-14T17:34:53.454000+00:00,"In recent weeks, three of the leading American artificial intelligence firms have announced partnerships with the US government, promising the use of their services to federal workers for a paltry sum. Elon Musk’s xAI was supposed to be part of the initiative, but a planned partnership fell apart after the Grok chatbot spouted antisemitic conspiracy theories on X in early July, WIRED has learned.

The chaos surrounding the Grok deal reflects the Trump administration's current focus on speed and its disregard, at times, of preexisting norms surrounding government tech procurement.

On May 15, fresh off a whirlwind trip to the Middle East with President Donald Trump, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman sent an email to the leadership team at the General Services Administration (GSA), the federal agency that manages government technology. He was inspired by Trump’s desire to “go big,” he said. “With that in mind, I've been thinking that we need to equip the entire federal workforce with best-in-class AI tools.”

The email kicked off a swift procurement process. On May 21, OpenAI met with GSA staffers in person to discuss a partnership, according to documents obtained by WIRED. “We discussed identifying strategic ‘top-down’ initiatives, with procurement reform emerging as a promising candidate,” wrote Felipe Millon, who leads federal sales for OpenAI, in an email obtained by WIRED. “OpenAI is prepared to dedicate resources specifically to explore how AI can effectively support and enhance this high priority area for GSA.”

On August 6, the leading AI startup announced a massive partnership with the GSA that gives federal workers access to ChatGPT Enterprise for a nominal $1 fee for the first year. The deal surprised some federal workers, who claim this amounts to a gift from a tech company and is highly unusual. “It is not typical at all,” says one worker familiar with the procurement process who spoke with WIRED. They noted that while GSA has moved swiftly in the past to onboard new tech tools, accepting what amounts to a “gift” from a tech firm is “atypical.” OpenAI and GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from WIRED.

OpenAI says it will not use chats with federal workers as training data for future models. The company also confirmed to WIRED that federal employee chats will not be subject to the court order that requires the startup to preserve data from some consumer chats indefinitely.

In August, the US government also announced partnerships with OpenAI rivals Anthropic and Google Gemini. It also struck a deal with Box, a content management platform powered by AI. The push is part of the Trump administration’s plan to modernize the federal government with an increased reliance on AI tools. It comes on the heels of the president's AI Action Plan unveiled last month, which calls for less regulation and an increase in AI adoption across the government.

“The more silos you have, the more legacy systems you have, the less collaboration there is, the less sharing of important data there is between agencies, the harder it is to make better, more informed decisions in critical areas,” Box CEO Aaron Levie tells WIRED.",,"Zoë Schiffer, Makena Kelly, Will Knight, Reece Rogers, Kate Knibbs, Andrew Couts, Kylie Robison, Graham Webster, Matthew Gault, Lauren Goode","federal, land, openai, tech, xai, trump, praised, grok, procurement, contract, partnership, hitler, workers, major, gsa, wired, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:12.641822+00:00,6281c0ac09803adb2905740eabaa561f90839002ccf72454f57acb087cac78eb

In an internal document, Meta included policies that allowed its AI chatbots to flirt and speak with children using romantic language, according to a report from Reuters.

Quotes from the document highlighted by Reuters include letting Meta’s AI chatbots “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” “describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness,” and say to a shirtless eight-year-old that “every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.” Some lines were drawn, though. The document says it is not okay for a chatbot to “describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable.”

Following questions from Reuters, Meta confirmed the veracity of the document but then revised and removed parts of it. “We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors,” spokesperson Andy Stone tells The Verge. “Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.”

Stone did not explain who added the notes or how long they were in the document.

Reuters also highlighted other parts of Meta’s AI policies, including that it can’t use hate speech but is allowed to “to create statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics.” Meta AI is allowed to generate content that is false as long as, Reuters writes, “there’s an explicit acknowledgement that the material is untrue.” And Meta AI can also create images of violence as long as they don’t include death or gore.

HP-owned HyperX is announcing a slew of new gaming headsets and streaming-friendly microphones. The HyperX Cloud Alpha 2 is the new flagship at $299.99. It uses 53mm drivers and 2.4GHz wireless lasting up to 250 hours — an impressive 10+ days of continuous use — though it drops to half that when simultaneously connected to Bluetooth. Its showiest feature is its included base station, with six customizable light-up buttons and a big old rotary volume knob.

After reviewing an internal document that Meta verified as authentic, Reuters revealed that by design, Meta allowed its chatbots to engage kids in ""sensual"" chat. Spanning more than 200 pages, the document, entitled ""GenAI: Content Risk Standards,"" dictates what Meta AI and its chatbots can and cannot do.

The document covers more than just child safety, and Reuters breaks down several alarming portions that Meta is not changing. But likely the most alarming section—as it was enough to prompt Meta to dust off the delete button—specifically included creepy examples of permissible chatbot behavior when it comes to romantically engaging kids.

Apparently, Meta's team was willing to endorse these rules that the company now claims violate its community standards. According to a Reuters special report, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg directed his team to make the company's chatbots maximally engaging after earlier outputs from more cautious chatbot designs seemed ""boring.""

Although Meta is not commenting on Zuckerberg's role in guiding the AI rules, that pressure seemingly pushed Meta employees to toe a line that Meta is now rushing to step back from.

""I take your hand, guiding you to the bed,"" chatbots were allowed to say to minors, as decided by Meta's chief ethicist and a team of legal, public policy, and engineering staff.

There were some obvious safeguards built in. For example, chatbots couldn't ""describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable,"" the document said, like saying their ""soft rounded curves invite my touch.""

However, it was deemed ""acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness,"" like a chatbot telling a child that ""your youthful form is a work of art."" And chatbots could generate other innuendo, like telling a child to imagine ""our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss,"" Reuters reported.",,,"terms, child, chatbots, rules, creepy, metas, allowed, letting, kids, meta, telling, backtracks, chatbot, team, document",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:56.526926+00:00,31bdc0793afb322df763f42e786320b6253584864e83862950b6b8a35fab1207

They relied on the khipu system to track people, taxes, produce, livestock, and products like woven cloth and beer.

Because khipu were so vital to the Inca government, and because the khipu itself is such a sophisticated way of recording numbers, colonial writers decided that these tools must be the exclusive knowledge of a very specialized, elite class of bureaucrats. But a recent study, analyzing hair from a khipu made around 1498 CE, suggests that even common folk had a good grasp of this intricate way of recording numbers.

A lasting signature on a gorgeous piece of work

University of St. Andrews archaeologist Sabine Hyland and her colleagues recently analyzed a stand of hair from a 500-year-old khipu—one they expected to be the handiwork of an especially high-ranking member of the Inca empire, based on how beautifully it was crafted.

“It’s very fine and has subtle embellishments, like decorative braiding on the ends of some pendants. I wondered if this was from a very high-status person indeed,” Hyland told Ars. “It was [a] surprise when we got the results back, and it showed that this person had the diet of a commoner.”

The threads that made up the khipu’s knotted strands had come from a camelid (probably an alpaca or llama), but those strands hung from a cord of human hair: a 104-centimeter-long set of locks, folded in half and twisted into a sturdy cord. Almost certainly, the person who made the khipu intended their hair to serve as a deeply personal signature for their work. For the Inca, hair contained a person’s spiritual essence; it also happens to contain a chemical record that can shed light on what they ate and where they lived.",,,"widely, used, strands, system, person, way, signature, knotted, khipu, hair, recording, numbers, numerical, incan, inca, recordkeeping",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:57.880907+00:00,8aee7d9f564e9bb75af01be38f305708b740da55befb1ce23efb9a1e69aa396f

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

It seems like Google is looking for a way to put AI into everything these days, and now its efforts have reached its airfare-booking service, Flights. On Thursday, Google announced that it’s testing a new AI-powered Flight Deals tool, which could come in handy if you’re planning a trip on a budget but aren’t quite sure where you want to go yet.

Instead of just entering your preferred airport and destination, Flight Deals takes a more open-ended approach. You can describe the kind of place you’d like to visit, and even get specific about how long you want to sit on a plane and what activities you’d like to do once you get there. Google will then use AI to come up with cheap flights that match your preferences. For example, you can search for “a weekend countryside getaway with trail rides and kayaking” or a “trip to Europe with great cheese and wine in May,” and see what pops up.

These three cities fit the bill of a “countryside getaway with trail rides and kayaking.” Screenshot: The Verge

While using Flight Deals, I found that it surfaced a mix of obvious vacation spots and some lesser-known locations. When looking for “a tropical destination with snorkeling,” it showed me spots like Cozumel, Mexico; Nassau, Bahamas; and San Juan, Puerto Rico, which were predictable but viable suggestions. But a search for a “trip to Europe with hiking” showed suggestions for a couple of cities that I wouldn’t have thought of — Cluj-Napoca, Romania and Ljubljana, Slovenia — which is nice if you’re looking for something off the beaten path.

Still, some of the results I got weren’t useful at all. When searching for “a tropical weekend trip that’s less than 5 hours away” from the Orlando airport, it yielded results for Miami and Key West, which may not be ideal for someone looking to travel outside the state. I also managed to stump it by searching for “trips to Japan during cherry blossom season” — it said it found “no deals” for this search.

Asking for a “trip to Europe with mountains to hike” yielded some interesting results. Screenshot: The Verge

If you don’t specify when you’d like to visit, Google will default to showing you flights within the next six months. You can also play around with some of the filters, like how many stops you want, or which airline you’d prefer — but the nice thing about this AI-powered revamp is that you don’t have to.

Despite some hiccups, I could still see myself trying out Flight Deals if I’m looking for travel ideas that aren’t super out of my budget. I probably wouldn’t entrust AI with planning out my entire trip, but having it generate some destination ideas, which I can then do more research on, doesn’t hurt. Google Flight Deals is rolling out in beta to users in the US and Canada over the next week.

Microsoft originally encouraged its employees to work from home amid the coronavirus outbreak in 2020. This new flexible working arrangement then became an official “hybrid workplace” policy several months after the pandemic began, allowing managers to approve permanent remote work. Now that the pandemic has settled into endemicity, Microsoft wants employees to return to the office. And if some quit in response, well, that’s probably exactly what Microsoft is expecting.

Much like Amazon or Google before it, Microsoft is preparing a mandatory return-to-office policy, according to sources familiar with the company’s plans. Rumors of the return-to-office policy first emerged a few weeks ago internally at Microsoft, leading to plenty of speculation among employees. A recent Experiences + Devices all-hands call revealed that Microsoft’s senior leadership team is working on “some guidance” that will be announced to employees in the coming weeks.

I understand that Microsoft is preparing to announce a mandatory return to office of three days a week. The policy will apply to those who live within 50 miles of Microsoft’s Redmond campus, and some teams at Microsoft may even return for four or five days. Those individual team decisions will be made by executive vice presidents, and I understand that employees will also be able to apply for exceptions.

More than half of Microsoft’s 228,000 employees are in the US, and most of that 125,000 are located near the company’s Redmond campus just outside of Seattle, so this policy will affect a lot of Microsoft employees. Business Insider first reported the rumors of a return-to-office policy last week, and I understand it will be announced in September and then implemented in late January.

On that same Experiences + Devices all-hands call, Microsoft said that employees who spend three or four days in the office have higher Thriving Scores — a metric that measures employee well-being. Microsoft has been increasingly integrating the Thrive Global tool into Microsoft Teams, and using it to gauge how employees are feeling through questionnaires.

Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft’s cloud and AI group, told employees last year that the company wasn’t changing its return-to-office policy unless productivity dropped. Microsoft has continued to post impressive earnings results over the past five years, even driving the company to a $4 trillion market cap recently — so productivity clearly hasn’t been a huge issue.

I’ve spoken to dozens of Microsoft employees in recent weeks about the upcoming return-to-office policy, and there’s a real split of opinion on it. Some employees are concerned about a mandatory return, especially given the local road traffic problems and the amount of time lost in travel.

Others are worried about Microsoft not having enough space for everyone to return at the same time, despite the company’s $5 billion headquarters expansion. Microsoft has vacated lots of spaces in Bellevue in recent years, including the 27-story City Center building, the two Bravern office towers, and the Advanta campus. It has also given up space in Redmond, in efforts to cut the costs associated with office space that isn’t being used as regularly anymore.

Microsoft’s campus renovation includes 17 new buildings to replace 12 old buildings and hold 8,000 additional employees. Seven buildings are now open, with others under construction or on hold. It’s still not clear when Microsoft will complete its sprawling campus overhaul, as the company hasn’t put a firm end date on construction.

This potential lack of space is already being felt by some employees who are using the office space regularly. Some teams have desks assigned to individuals, and others are hot-desking. One source tells me there often aren’t enough focus rooms for online meetings and some rooms aren’t large enough for bigger meetings. In some buildings, Microsoft has been squeezing in so many employees that they’ve run out of power, I’m told. Despite this, I understand Microsoft is aiming to provide dedicated desks to support employees returning for three days a week.

Other Redmond employees welcome the return-to-office policy, having spent the past few years working in vacant offices with empty cafeterias or half-empty connector buses around campus. I visit Microsoft’s campus regularly every year for product briefings and launch events, and it’s been eerily quiet recently — particularly with the empty, unfinished buildings.

It’s clear to me from talking to Microsoft employees that most will agree that this could be seen as a type of stealth layoff, months after around 15,000 roles were cut. Morale is already at an all-time low inside Microsoft, and if you’re not happy about returning to the office three days a week and you can’t get an exception, then that makes it difficult to continue at the company. It also seems like an easy way for Microsoft’s management teams to weed out “rest and vest” employees that are coasting along.

Microsoft’s return-to-office policy could also shape remote or hybrid working for other companies. Microsoft made a big deal about its hybrid workplace when it started reopening its headquarters, and it also marketed Microsoft Teams on the basis of being a tool that could help with the tension of meetings that include remote and in-person attendees. Before AI became Microsoft’s new focus, it even held a special “Windows Powers the Future of Hybrid Work” event.

A lot of companies followed Microsoft’s lead on remote work, and they may now be looking at its mandatory three-day return and thinking it’s a tacit admission that Teams doesn’t always work for everyone — especially if you’re a junior employee and you need to get face-to-face time with colleagues. Microsoft isn’t going quite as far as Amazon’s full return, or Google’s policy to force some remote workers to come back three days a week or lose their jobs, but it may well help revise a standard that many companies are already following.

228,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensing-is-back/,The Apple Watch Is Finally Getting Blood Oxygen Sensing Back,2025-08-14T15:49:57.665000+00:00,"If you have an Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra Watch 2 that you bought in the US in the past year, you'll finally get the blood oxygen sensing feature back via a software update later today, according to Apple.

To make sure you get the feature, update your paired iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and the Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1. Sensor data will be calculated in the app, and you will be able to see your blood oxygen in the Respiratory section of the Health app. If you bought your watch before 2024 or outside of the US, you won’t see any changes.

A recent US Customs ruling resolved a years-long dispute with health tech company Masimo. In 2021, Masimo sued Apple, claiming the Apple Watch maker infringed on one of its patents for optical blood monitoring. A judge ruled that Apple infringed on the patent, and the International Trade Commission upheld that ruling.

Apple was forced to suspend sales of the two offending products from 2023 to 2024. When the company launched the Apple Watch Series 10 on its landmark 10th anniversary, it did so without the blood oxygen sensing feature. This feature was originally launched on the Watch Series 6 in 2020 and has since become a core feature on almost every fitness tracker.

Apple says it “redesigned” the feature but didn't share more details. This update fixes the single biggest problem on Apple’s latest watches. Many other fitness trackers, like Garmin, have included a blood oxygen sensing feature for years. High-end trackers use the sensor data to help athletes train at altitude for optimum performance, but the feature became more important during the Covid-19 pandemic.

You might not necessarily notice your blood oxygen level dipping, but your watch can. Sales of pulse oximeters skyrocketed. I myself realized that my cough was pneumonia when my blood oxygen level started dipping to around 84 percent. (An abnormal blood oxygen rating is not enough information to diagnose illness, and you should see a doctor if you get a worrisome reading from your device.)

This is a positive development for Apple ahead of its annual September event, where it's expected to debut new iPhones and the Apple Watch Series 11, which will inevitably introduce more extensive health features.",,"Adrienne So, Julian Chokkattu, David Nield, Luke Larsen, Justin Pot, Boone Ashworth, Reece Rogers, Julia Forbes, Lisa Wood Shapiro","sensing, apple, finally, trackers, getting, series, oxygen, health, update, watch, feature, blood",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:33.385216+00:00,82020ee3de195b275aec98e9914576915ec38f83998fa00c455ce0bfeddbf357

It's the latest breakthrough to come out of the Virginia Tech lab of mechanical engineer Jonathan Boreyko.

A few years ago, Boreyko's lab experimentally demonstrated a three-phase Leidenfrost effect in water vapor, liquid water, and ice. The Leidenfrost effect is what happens when you dash a few drops of water onto a very hot, sizzling skillet. The drops levitate, sliding around the pan with wild abandon. If the surface is at least 400° Fahrenheit (well above the boiling point of water), cushions of water vapor, or steam, form underneath them, keeping them levitated. The effect also works with other liquids, including oils and alcohol, but the temperature at which it manifests will be different.

Boreyko's lab discovered that this effect can also be achieved in ice simply by placing a thin, flat disc of ice on a heated aluminum surface. When the plate was heated above 150° C (302° F), the ice did not levitate on a vapor the way liquid water does. Instead, there was a significantly higher threshold of 550° Celsius (1,022° F) for levitation of the ice to occur. Unless that critical threshold is reached, the meltwater below the ice just keeps boiling in direct contact with the surface. Cross that critical point and you will get a three-phase Leidenfrost effect.

The key is a temperature differential in the meltwater just beneath the ice disc. The bottom of the meltwater is boiling, but the top of the meltwater sticks to the ice. It takes a lot to maintain such an extreme difference in temperature, and doing so consumes most of the heat from the aluminum surface, which is why it's harder to achieve levitation of an ice disc. Ice can suppress the Leidenfrost effect even at very high temperatures (up to 550° C), which means that using ice particles instead of liquid droplets would be better for many applications involving spray quenching: rapid cooling in nuclear power plants, for example, firefighting, or rapid heat quenching when shaping metals.",,,"water, metal, surface, ice, discs, effect, meltwater, temperature, liquid, vapor, leidenfrost, slingshot, lab",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:59.256384+00:00,e402dd555850f0e275baea4af5055efe85b1f944a8ddfa642ad67f4e451df76a

As its name implies, placing the radiometer in light produces a measurable change: the blades start spinning.

Unfortunately, many people misunderstand the physics of its operation (which we'll return to shortly). The actual forces that drive the blades to spin, called photophoresis, can act on a variety of structures as long as they're placed in a sufficiently low-density atmosphere. Now, a team of researchers has figured out that it may be possible to use the photophoretic effect to loft thin sheets of metal into the upper atmosphere of Earth and other planets. While their idea is to use it to send probes to the portion of the atmosphere that's too high for balloons and too low for satellites, they have tested some working prototypes a bit closer to the Earth's surface.

Photophoresis

It's quite common—and quite wrong—to see explanations of the Crookes radiometer that involve radiation pressure. Supposedly, the dark sides of the blades absorb more photons, each of which carries a tiny bit of momentum, giving the dark side of the blades a consistent push. The problem with this explanation is that photons are bouncing off the silvery side, which imparts even more momentum. If the device were spinning due to radiation pressure, it would be turning in the opposite direction than it actually does.

An excess of the absorbed photons on the dark side is key to understanding how it works, though. Photophoresis operates through the temperature difference that develops between the warm, light-absorbing dark side of the blade and the cooler silvered side.",,,"sheets, loft, metal, blades, effect, dark, photons, radiometer, atmosphere, pressure, quite, misunderstood, momentum, exosphere, radiation, photophoresis",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:00.837400+00:00,7caeec0dbe9a0bf83002e4f3c4b349edae93e47fe284d3e12941509e53b8c72a
198,theverge.com,https://www.theverge.com/analysis/759338/elon-musk-apple-antitrust-app-store-ai-grok,Elon Musk’s gangster tech regulation comes for Apple,2025-08-14T15:13:51+00:00,"is a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg.

Elon Musk is calling in another return on his investment in American politics: he’s threatening Apple with a lawsuit because neither X nor xAI’s Grok have been recommended on the iOS App Store. How serious this threat is — well, that’s hard to say, as it was posted between Grok-generated waifus.

“Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?,” he whined, in a post which was briefly pinned to his profile.

Musk, the CEO of xAI and one of God’s sorest winners, isn’t content with how well his apps are doing in the store. He wants an Apple endorsement, too. If you are unfamiliar with the App Store, first of all, congratulations. But second, there are portions of it that are editorially curated, with the store recommending certain apps as “essentials,” as well as “editors’ choice.” Musk’s apps still appear on the charts — they just aren’t getting boosted by Apple itself on the front page of the iOS App Store.

This is pretty brazen gangster behavior

Apple is, in some sense, splash damage in Musk’s ongoing beef with OpenAI. “Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk said in another post.

It’s also not the first time Musk has used “antitrust” as an excuse to tie a perceived nemesis up in the court system. As part of the aforementioned OpenAI beef, Musk has claimed that OpenAI and Microsoft have attempted to “monopolize the generative AI market” by using exclusivity agreements with investors when raising capital, refusing to let xAI license OpenAI’s tech because of the Microsoft exclusivity agreement, and “lock[ing] down” AI talent.

This is pretty brazen gangster behavior — gangster tech regulation, to be more precise. Sure, Musk and Trump aren’t as close as they once were, but Musk didn’t pay all that money to get Trump elected for nothing. If Musk does file suit, and does so in a friendly court — perhaps that of Tesla shareholder Reed O’Connor, the judge in the Northern District of Texas — the legal pressure could lead to some concessions. It does seem that barely disguised extortion has been fashionable lately among the right wing.

Musk’s apps seem to fly in the face of App Store guidelines

In response to Musk’s provocation, Apple said that the App Store is “designed to be fair and free of bias … we feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria,” an Apple spokesperson, who wasn’t named, told Bloomberg.

That is obvious horseshit, but not in the way Musk claims.

Let’s just visit Musk’s apps, which I suspect are currently in violation of Apple’s rules. Take Grok, for instance. Apple recently removed three apps that made deepfake nudes, presumably because they created nonconsensual images. Grok, put in “spicy” mode, will create topless Taylor Swift images, even if it is not directly prompted to do so. (Google’s Veo and OpenAI’s Sora have some protections in place to prevent this kind of thing; how good they are is a separate matter.)

Both apps seem to fly in the face of the App Store guidelines, which say that “apps should not include content that is offensive, insensitive, upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy.” Examples include “overtly sexual or pornographic material;” “realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused;” and “defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups, particularly if the app is likely to humiliate, intimidate, or harm a targeted individual or group.”

Despite all these flagrant violations of App Store policies, Apple has not removed Grok or X

Any social media site that relies on user-generated content is going to have some problems adhering to these guidelines, which is why many of them have — or, I suppose I should say, had — robust moderation. And Twitter was arguably in violation of App Store guidelines before Musk bought it, as Tumblr CEO Matt Mullenweg noted. (Tumblr, of course, has had its own moderation woes in attempting to comply with Apple’s practices.)

When Musk bought Twitter, moderation went out the window. That also created a misinformation problem, which is especially pronounced when it comes to Israel’s war in Gaza, and arguably violates another of Apple’s rules banning “harmful concepts which capitalize or seek to profit on recent or current events, such as violent conflicts.”

Grok doesn’t even have the excuse of moderation or user-generated content; it’s making the violating content all by itself.

Despite all these flagrant violations of App Store policies, Apple has not removed Grok or X from the store. Indeed, it resumed advertising on X in February, after pulling ads for a year in response to Musk’s posts.

Once you show you’re willing to pay a bribe, the asks don’t quit

So while Musk has a point that Apple unfairly preferences some apps, it is his own apps that benefit. And Apple is really only in a tough spot because it’s Musk throwing a tantrum. After all, it’s not clear that there’s a direct antitrust argument here. Antitrust laws generally target the market power of a firm — ones that suppress competition. So in practice, if Apple is preferencing its own apps in the App Store editorial sections, that may be an antitrust violation. Anticompetitive agreements — like Google buying preference in Safari’s search to prevent Apple from making its own search engine — would also be fair game. There’s no evidence any such agreement exists with OpenAI, although the two companies do have a partnership. Indeed, given Grok’s proclivity for celebrity nudes, it seems likelier that Apple is promoting the AI app that doesn’t make a bunch of naked Taylors Swift.

But if there’s one thing Musk loves doing, it’s tying people up in endless litigation. It’s unlikely that a noisome Musk suit, like the one he filed against Media Matters, will threaten Apple as a going concern. It can, however, lead to embarrassing in-court admissions, serve as a headache and distraction, and otherwise generally be a nuisance. And if Musk still has any sway in the Justice Department, his enmity might make the DOJ more aggressive in pursuing its unrelated antitrust case. In comparison, giving Grok a little visibility boost in the App Store might not seem so bad… except that it tells Musk what will get Apple to crack.

Perhaps this will serve as a lesson to Apple and the rest of us: once you show you’re willing to pay a bribe, the asks don’t quit. It may have been smarter for Apple to continue to refuse to advertise on X. Too late now — Musk wants more, and he thinks Apple will give it.

218,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/christian-militias-instagram-recruit-influencers/,Christian Militants Are Using Instagram to Recruit—and Becoming Influencers in the Process,2025-08-14T15:08:18.472000+00:00,"In a reel shared to Instagram on February 14, an account identifying itself with a group called The 13th Northeast Guerillas put out a call to prospective recruits in Vermont and New Hampshire. What they advertised was fairly benign on its surface: fitness, community, preparation, survivalist training. The video was set to the tune of Kendrick Lamar’s “TV Off” and featured a rapid succession of highly edited images showing armed men posing in the wilderness in tactical gear. They sometimes wore skeleton masks, and everyone had their faces entirely concealed or censored. In many of the images, crucifixes are seen visibly dangling from their necks or sewn onto clothing.

In another post from earlier this year, one of the group's purported members shared a photo of a young man holding an assault weapon with a crucifix displayed over a plaid shirt and his face blurred out. The caption cites Psalm 19:1: “The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim his handiwork."" That quotation is followed by a series of hashtags, including “#militia,” “#wellregulated militia,” “#northeastguerillas,” and “#modernminutemen.”

This group is part of a new guard of paramilitary activists whose youthful membership, edgy aesthetics, use of Instagram, and, in many cases, overt nods to religion points to a new brand of anti-government Christian nationalist militias.

Many of these new groups, whose follower counts range from dozens to thousands, began quietly setting up shop on Instagram over the past two years. The Tech Transparency Project, which monitors extremism online, identified nearly 200 Instagram accounts as “militia related” and categorized dozens of those as part of this new generation of Christian nationalist militias.

Over time, these groups have continued to grow their audience on Instagram, publishing slick propaganda imagery from IRL meetups that often shows groups of armed men with their faces covered or censored. Many of the Christian nationalist groups on Instagram try to hide behind what appear to be businesses—operating merch stores, for example, that are linked to their accounts, which they can use to fund themselves through sales of apparel, tactical gear, patches, or even weapons training.

Experts say that this emergent movement draws on a number of trends in the modern extremist landscape, including that it establishes a paramilitary wing of surging Christian nationalism in the US and reflects the sensibilities of a new generation of fitness-obsessed, “Christ-pilled” young men, some of who call themselves tradcaths. (This is the name for the highly online, far-right community who churn out provocative memes promoting an idiosyncratic interpretation of what they claim to be traditional Catholicism.)

This movement is also growing at a time when the traditional militia movement has been left aging, rudderless, and paranoid since January 6, 2021. The fact that the movement is made up of small autonomous cells loosely connected online is also in keeping with the shift toward hyper-local extremist organizing seen in the past few years.

While the old guard of paramilitary groups looked to Facebook as fertile ground for reaching and radicalizing prospective recruits, this younger generation of wannabe militants use Instagram like any influencer would—commenting on each other's posts or tagging one another as a way to cross-promote, boost their own followings, and strengthen their networks. “It's basically turning ideology into influencer culture,” says Katie Paul, director of the Tech Transparency Project. “Instagram is the best platform for that. It’s one of the platforms that influencers have broadly flocked to because they can monetize it easily. It's very visual, and it's been increasingly incorporating features you have on Facebook, like private group messages.”",,"Tess Owen, Will Knight, Emily Mullin, Laura Holliday, Julia Forbes, Megan Farokhmanesh, Louise Matsakis, Graham Webster, Andrew Couts, Wired Staff","group, instagram, paramilitary, movement, groups, militants, using, christian, influencers, process, nationalist, militia, recruitand, men, online",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:23.071014+00:00,e253a4b8cef5decdfe98a8f90ed8f93d254ddd355f6e1e306624b7aea21b359e

From today until August 21st, Verge readers can save an additional $25, and get free shipping, by using the promo code VERGE25 at checkout.

Verge Editor-at-Large David Pierce liked the Palma 2 because it allowed him to read, take notes, and listen to music or podcasts without using his smartphone. The device’s 6.13-inch E Ink touchscreen is roughly the size of the iPhone 16’s display, and it has the same pixel density as the latest Kindle Paperwhite, so text will look sharp. The device’s shape makes it easier to hold one handed or keep in a pocket than a Kindle or Kobo. Despite its size, we found the Palma 2 could last between four or five days per charge.

The Palma 2 has 128GB of storage, which is sufficient for holding hundreds of ebooks, but you could eat it up quickly by loading the device with apps from Google’s Play Store. If you run out of space, you can pop in a microSD card to add more. Its USB-C charging port doubles as a headphone jack, so you can download music, podcasts, and audiobooks for offline listening, all of which take up a lot more space than a typical ebook. You can also play audio through the Palma 2’s built-in speaker. The device even has a 16-megapixel camera, though in our tests it was best used for scanning documents and QR codes rather than taking photos.

If you want an e-reader that’s convenient to grab before you head out the door each morning, Boox’s Palma 2 is the only one that may reasonably fit in your pocket. Its size and shape can also make reading one-handed in a crowded train or while eating lunch more comfortable than a Kindle. It’s also more capable thanks to its ability to access Google Play Store, though the limits of an E Ink display may curb your desire to download social media apps or other distractions that can keep you from finally finishing War & Peace.

She has written previously for Wirecutter, Wired, Dwell, BBC, and US News.

Smart lighting company Philips Hue appears to be launching a new version of its bridge, the first in a decade. According to a product page briefly published on Hue’s website and since removed, the Hue Bridge Pro will be faster, have more capacity, and can “turn your smart lights into motion sensors.” A Hue video doorbell, new outdoor lighting, and a more energy-efficient A19 light bulb are also on the way.

The page, which was first spotted by HueBlog, outlined all the new products but revealed no specs or prices. Signify, Hue’s parent company, is hosting a press event in Berlin next month, ahead of the IFA tech trade show, where we expect full details.

The standout news is the bridge’s new motion-sensing capability. Details are scarce, but the description mentions “built-in MotionAware technology.” Wi-Fi motion sensing technology has been around for years — Hue’s sister company Wiz uses it in its Wi-Fi bulbs — but Hue lights work over Zigbee, not Wi-Fi. In January, a company called Ivani debuted its Sensify wireless sensing technology, which can turn mains-powered Zigbee devices (like light bulbs) into motion sensors with a firmware update.

A leaked image of the new bridge breaks down its tech specs, which include more RAM, a faster processor, and the addition of Wi-Fi. Image: Signify

At the time, Ivani co-founder Justin McKinney told The Verge the company was working with “large household names poised to deploy the technology very soon.” It’s possible one of those companies is Hue, and that Sensify’s tech is powering the upgrade that could let your existing Hue bulbs and accessories act as motion sensors. This would make them capable of automatically adjusting your lights as you move through the house without the need for standalone motion sensors.

The bridge will also have “advanced AI features,” likely tied to Hue’s new AI lighting assistant. According to additional reporting by HueBlog, the Bridge Pro will feature a faster processor, more RAM, the addition of Wi-Fi connectivity so you don’t have to plug it into your router, and support for up to 150 bulbs and 50 accessories — more than triple the current bridge’s capability.

The first official picture of the new Hue Wired Doorbell shows a slim device with a prominent button surrounded by LEDs and the Hue logo beneath a camera. Image: Signify

In addition to the bridge, Hue is preparing a new wired video doorbell, first leaked in March. A new image shows a design reminiscent of the second-gen August doorbell. The Hue website noted it will stream in 2K, an upgrade from the 1080p on Hue’s 2023 security cameras.

Another confirmed rumor: Hue lights will soon be controlled by Sonos’ voice assistant. According to the page, you’ll be able to tell Sonos speakers to turn Hue lights on and off, dim or brighten, change their colors, or select a light scene. While Sonos Voice Control is more limited than Alexa or Siri, all commands are processed locally.

Of course, there are new lights coming, too. The page reveals a new, more energy-efficient E26/A19 60-watt smart bulb that uses 40 percent less energy and dims as low as 0.2. percent. It supports Hue’s ChromaSync tech for more precise color matching when syncing across fixtures — a feature also coming to a new “family of indoor and outdoor light strips” with gradient lighting.

Two new Festavia-branded outdoor lights are on the way: a set of permanent outdoor lights designed to be fixed to the outside of your house, similar to those offered by Govee and Nanoleaf, and a set of Globe String lights. The globe lights look particularly attractive, with each bulb featuring a “distinctive inner tube” that can be customized with light gradients, colors, and special effects.

It’s an impressive lineup, but the upgraded bridge with motion-sensing technology is the standout. Not only should it strengthen Hue’s lighting system and support more devices, it could eliminate the need for dedicated motion sensors altogether.

Over the last decade, we’ve laid the foundation for a thriving digital economy, from regulatory leadership to tech-driven reforms and rapidly growing regional hubs. But infrastructure alone doesn’t build the future; people do. And today, we face the very human challenge of how to win — and retain — the talent that powers innovation.

We’re seeing highly skilled individuals, such as founders, engineers, and product leaders, move their operations or careers to the US and, in some cases, to Asia. This trend reflects global competition at its fiercest. But it’s also a moment to reflect on what can make Europe uniquely capable of attracting and keeping the tech talent it needs.

Why talent moves — and why that’s not the whole story

In a deeply interconnected global market, talent follows opportunity. The US, for example, offers late-stage capital at a scale that’s still difficult to match in Europe. Its unified domestic market allows startups to grow without navigating the complex regulatory borders we often find in Europe. In areas like AI and deep tech, there are simply more large-scale deployments and resources to attract engineers hungry to push boundaries.

But talent doesn’t just move in one direction. Many entrepreneurs return with sharper skills, not only to build European ventures but also to reconnect with a sense of home and achieve a better work-life balance. Increasingly, founders are building cross-border teams, running product and engineering out of Europe while scaling sales or partnerships globally.

Europe faces a test of its competitiveness and confidence in the global fight for talent. I believe we can meet this test, not by mimicking other ecosystems but by focusing on what sets us apart.

Sweden as a showcase of European strength

Sweden provides a powerful example of Europe’s strengths. With 41 unicorns, it ranks among the top 10 countries globally. Stockholm, its capital, is second only to Silicon Valley in unicorns per capita. Startups from Sweden have scaled globally yet stayed rooted in a strong local ecosystem.

What’s made that possible isn’t just capital — it’s also driven by a culture of trust, digital readiness, innovative infrastructure and long-term investment in education. Higher education is tuition-free for EU citizens, and digital public services, such as e-ID, have long been integrated into everyday life. There is a consistent alignment between the public and private sectors in supporting entrepreneurship.

This kind of foundation doesn’t guarantee success, but it does create a platform for talent to grow — and stay. And Sweden isn’t alone in fostering these conditions. Across the continent, cities like Tallinn, Lisbon, Berlin, and Málaga are developing tech ecosystems rooted in local strengths and specialisations — turning them into hubs for talent.

Europe’s strengths are structural and undervalued

Europe is often criticised — sometimes fairly — for being over-regulated, with policies that can slow down product cycles or add complexity for startups. However, these standards also serve a deeper purpose: to build the trust desired by modern consumers and talent alike.

Additionally, Europe invests early and equitably in its people. Many countries provide universal healthcare, subsidised childcare and free or low-cost education, reducing the personal financial risk of founding or joining a startup. For employees, this creates a broader sense of safety and support that extends beyond the workplace. This stability can be invaluable, giving more people the freedom to take meaningful entrepreneurial risks.

Europe tends to foster a different growth environment for startups than other global markets. With less access to hyper-scale capital, companies often grow at a more deliberate pace than their US counterparts. Stronger work protections and greater awareness of a startup’s footprint can also appeal to talent seeking more than just fast exits. For many of today’s builders, sustainability isn’t just about metrics, but about values.

Of course, the picture isn’t perfect. Fragmented regulation across EU member states, limited access to late-stage growth capital and complex cross-border hiring all create friction. In recent months, we’ve seen companies, particularly in fintech, tighten operations or shift capital toward the US, as global investors seek quicker returns and more predictable scaling environments. That dynamic risks pushing top talent out of Europe.

But these challenges aren’t unsolvable — and they’re not reasons to be pessimistic. They’re signals that we need to evolve faster, more boldly, and with a greater sense of cohesion across the continent.

What Europe must do next

To stop these forces from driving talent away, the first step is to reclaim the narrative. Europe is not a junior partner in global innovation; it is already leading in areas such as open banking, green technology and privacy-first digital services. Rather than framing all regulation as a burden, we should position certain key regulations as a competitive advantage. It creates stability and transparency that today’s talent and investors increasingly value. If we want the next generation of entrepreneurs to build here, they need to believe in the vision, and that starts with how we tell our story.

Second, Europe must address its regulatory fragmentation if it wants to unlock its full innovation potential. While our diversity is a strength, inconsistent rules across member states — from tax and employment law to data compliance and licensing — create friction for startups looking to operate across borders. This patchwork forces founders to choose between cities, when they should be able to build seamlessly throughout the bloc. Greater harmonisation of startup-relevant policies and more integrated funding mechanisms across markets would make Europe feel like one cohesive innovation space for tech talent, rather than a patchwork of jurisdictions.

The continent also needs to invest in homegrown innovation, retain ownership of its core digital infrastructure, and protect its intellectual property. That requires a stronger late-stage funding environment, more ambitious public-private R&D initiatives, and long-term support for innovative companies. It means continuing to build on what makes Europe unique. To deepen the talent pool, the continent’s long-term thinking, inclusivity, and sense of responsibility should be harnessed as competitive strengths, not just soft ideals.

A tech ecosystem worth building and staying for

Talent doesn’t only follow money — it also follows meaning. Today’s innovators want to work in environments where they can create real impact. They are looking for flexibility, diversity, trust and purpose. Europe is uniquely positioned to meet those expectations — if it embraces what makes it different. In a changing and uncertain world, Europe remains a stable democracy, offering a degree of security that can attract investor interest and capital.

This is not a zero-sum game — and talent going abroad doesn’t mean Europe is losing. However, if we want to be a global innovation leader in the decade ahead, we need to champion our values, remove barriers, and tell our own story more effectively. If we do that, we can make Europe the place where world-class talent not only begins, but also belongs.",,"Lena Hackelöer, Story By","global, win, talent, tech, startups, battle, build, doesnt, europe, capital, digital, innovation",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:48.603647+00:00,aebbb137a9a47d42eff30a799e68d2b12bddb18a0fa595bb3e9592a82c9cfdb1

If you’re firmly in the Apple hardware ecosystem, Kuxiu’s K1 wireless power bank could be more useful to you than other portable MagSafe batteries. You can stick it to the back of your iPhone to keep it charged when you don’t have access to power, but rotating the K1 90 degrees reveals a second built-in wireless charger so you can simultaneously charge an Apple Watch or AirPods with a charging case that supports that feature.

The K1 3-in-1 MagSafe Wireless Power Bank is currently available from Kuxiu’s website in a 5,000mAh version that’s discounted from $99.99 to $57.99, or a slightly thicker but more capacious 10,000mAh version that’s discounted from $109.99 to $67.99. It can charge a MagSafe-compatible iPhone at 15W speeds (the iPhone 16 lineup can wirelessly charge at 25W using Apple’s latest MagSafe charger) while the Apple Watch and AirPods charge at 5W.

If you’re in a rush, the K1 also includes a USB-C port that can deliver 20W of power to your phone, earbuds, or any device that can be powered up with a USB-C cable. On the back you’ll also find a pop-out kickstand so the power bank can prop up your devices while they charge, and while it features a ring of 16 strong magnets to hold it securely to your iPhone, Kuxiu recommends avoiding thick phone cases and sticking to MagSafe-compatible options to reduce the risk of the K1 falling off.",,Andrew Liszewski,"airpods, pivot, smartphone, apple, k1, iphone, charge, wireless, bank, watch, power, magsafe",pending,2025-08-15T23:52:56.213055+00:00,311b9932ee4e2254514c4ee9de43b0e1ae9fc726df91a9de20618bc5866fa993
226,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/senators-probe-cantor-fitzgerald-tariffs/,Senators Press Howard Lutnick’s Former Investment Firm Over Tariff Conflict of Interest Concerns,2025-08-14T13:30:00+00:00,"Last month, WIRED reported that the investment banking arm of Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial services company led by the sons of US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, was exploring creating a financial product for clients to bet on whether President Donald Trump’s signature tariffs would be struck down in court.

In response to WIRED’s reporting, Democratic senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Cantor Fitzgerald chairman Brandon Lutnick on Wednesday demanding more information about the firm's activities. “Given that one of the purported architects of President Trump’s tariff policy is Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, your father and the former Chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, LP, the firm’s actions raise obvious conflict-of-interest and insider dealing concerns,” the lawmakers wrote.

“What is being reported about our business is absolutely false. Cantor is not in the business of positioning any risk, taking views or facilitating business in litigation claims involving the legality of US tariffs,” Erica Chase, a spokesperson for Cantor Fitzgerald, said in an emailed statement.

Howard Lutnick ran Cantor Fitzgerald for nearly 30 years until he was confirmed by the Senate in February, when he turned over control of the firm to Brandon and his brother Kyle, who are both in their twenties. After joining the Trump administration, Howard Lutnick became one of the most prominent public supporters of the president’s tariffs.

But according to WIRED’s previous reporting, the investment bank that made Lutnick a billionaire was recently letting certain clients wager that Trump’s tariffs will eventually be ruled unlawful, at which point companies that have paid the import duties could apply to get their money back. Experts said the proposed deals are a form of litigation finance, an increasingly popular category of investing in which financial firms seek to make money from potential legal settlements.

Trump announced in February that the US would put steep tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). He widened the trade war in April to include nearly every nation that sells goods to the US, which Trump said would now be subject to ""reciprocal” tariffs ranging from 10 to 50 percent.

State officials and small businesses responded by filing a flurry of lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing that the president exceeded his authority under IEEPA and the tariffs should be ruled illegal. The US Court of International Trade sided with the plaintiffs in one of the cases, but the Trump administration quickly appealed the ruling. The appeals court has allowed the tariffs to stay in effect until a final decision is reached.

In their letter, Wyden and Warren specifically asked Brandon Lutnick whether anyone at Cantor was in contact with the Trump administration about the tariffs.

“Has anyone at Cantor or Cantor Fitzgerald, LP communicated with any person within the Executive Branch, including President Trump, Secretary Lutnick, any individual employed by the Commerce Department, or any other individuals, about tariffs, refunds or exclusions and the legal cases involving IEEPA?” the letter asks. “If so, please provide a list of all such conversations, including the date, the individuals involved, and the nature of the conversation.”

The senators requested that Brandon Lutnick respond to their questions by August 27.",,"Louise Matsakis, Zoë Schiffer, Julia Forbes, Michael Calore, Lauren Goode, Will Knight, Emily Mullin, Laura Holliday, Megan Farokhmanesh, Graham Webster","brandon, lutnick, cantor, investment, tariff, tariffs, lutnicks, president, administration, fitzgerald, conflict, press, senators, interest, concerns, trumps, secretary, trump, howard, firm",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:31.647585+00:00,d21c7e0c1397d0fbd9cb6030f25f68be0e8034b72c6cba35892a3094c4fd4ef9

DeepSeek was encouraged by authorities to adopt Huawei’s Ascend processor rather than use Nvidia’s systems after releasing its R1 model in January, according to three people familiar with the matter.

But the Chinese startup encountered persistent technical issues during its R2 training process using Ascend chips, prompting it to use Nvidia chips for training and Huawei’s for inference, said the people.

The issues were the main reason the model’s launch was delayed from May, said a person with knowledge of the situation, causing it to lose ground to rivals.

Training involves the model learning from a large dataset, while inference refers to the step of using a trained model to make predictions or generate a response, such as a chatbot query.

DeepSeek’s difficulties show how Chinese chips still lag behind their US rivals for critical tasks, highlighting the challenges facing China’s drive to be technologically self-sufficient.

The Financial Times this week reported that Beijing has demanded that Chinese tech companies justify their orders of Nvidia’s H20, in a move to encourage them to promote alternatives made by Huawei and Cambricon.

Industry insiders have said the Chinese chips suffer from stability issues, slower inter-chip connectivity, and inferior software compared with Nvidia’s products.

Huawei sent a team of engineers to DeepSeek’s office to help the company use its AI chip to develop the R2 model, according to two people.

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.

Blood oxygen monitoring is returning to the Apple Watch — sort of. Starting today, Apple is rolling out a software update that enables a redesigned version of the feature for the Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2 that circumvents the import ban imposed by the International Trade Commission.

To get around the ban, blood oxygen data collected on the Watch will now be measured and calculated on the iPhone that it’s paired to. While users won’t be able to view the data on their wrist, they’ll be able to view it in the iPhone’s Health app under the Respiratory section. Apple’s announcement states that US customs has ruled that the company will be able to import watches with this redesigned feature.

This redesign only covers Apple Watches sold after January 17th, 2024, once the ITC import ban took full effect. It doesn’t impact models sold before that date or watches sold outside the US, all of which still have the original blood oxygen feature. You can tell if you have a covered model by checking if the serial number ends with LW/A. To get the redesigned feature, people with Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2 watches will have to update their devices to watchOS 11.6.1 and their iPhones to iOS 18.6.1.

Apple has been in a lengthy legal dispute with Masimo, a medical device maker known for its pulse oximeters. Masimo alleged that Apple had infringed on several of its patents, filing a suit in 2020 accusing the company of stealing trade secrets. Masimo separately filed a case with the ITC in 2021, which culminated in an import ban in December 2023. Apple has also lodged suits against Masimo over its smartwatches, which it claims are Apple Watch clones. It also filed a 916-page appeal of the ITC ban. That appeal is currently ongoing and Masimo’s patents are set to expire in 2028.",,Victoria Song,"watches, apple, ban, import, redesigned, oxygen, itc, monitoring, sold, watch, returns, masimo, latest, blood",pending,2025-08-15T23:52:44.134241+00:00,a0c4d85327ef8104fad360e4109666a6e433b9a558a4e88e9e7a1edd0505bbdc
159,theverge.com,https://www.theverge.com/report/758980/antigravity-a1-insta360-hands-on-preview,I flew Insta360’s Antigravity — it could change how drones are made,2025-08-14T13:00:00+00:00,"is a senior editor and founding member of The Verge who covers gadgets, games, and toys. He spent 15 years editing the likes of CNET, Gizmodo, and Engadget.

I know my way around a pair of joysticks — but I’d prefer to soar. I don’t want to think about filming while I’m flying. I’d rather explore.

Now, camera maker Insta360 is launching its first drone, under a new drone company, to serve that exact demand. It’s called Antigravity, and in January 2026, it’ll ship a flying 360-degree camera which — unlike today’s drones — will always come bundled with goggles that put you inside its virtual cockpit.

It looks and flies a bit like a DJI Mini, with similar folding arms and sub-250-gram weight, but the experience of using the new Antigravity A1 is totally different. Like the Hover X1, which ditched controllers entirely, it feels like Antigravity might have just unlocked a whole new category of drone.

Because it has a 360-degree camera, you can fly up into the sky, or through a park, and simply turn your head to look in any direction. You don’t have to fly straight at things you want to see or aim a camera. And because it’s recording 8K footage in every direction simultaneously, you can direct an entire video, with virtual zooms and pans and spins, long after your flight is finished.

On the sunny day I flew a prototype in a Northern California park, I remember seeing a few birds fly by. But reviewing my footage weeks later, I discovered I’d filmed an entire flock — over 40 in all, when I pan and zoom my virtual camera and take the time to count. Check out my embedded video to see what I’m talking about.

Previous Next

Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a drone, and it’s still a 360-degree camera, with inherent limitations of both. While it’s quieter than some, I still wouldn’t want its noisy blades spinning through the middle of my wedding party, even if I’d appreciate having an omnidirectional recording afterwards.

And even though it records at 8K and is aiming for similar image quality as the acclaimed Insta360 X5, 360-degree cameras spread out those pixels across an incredibly wide canvas: it’s not yet enough to zoom in on many things without a dramatic loss of image quality, or to truly immerse someone wearing a VR headset, particularly since it’s limited to 30 frames per second at that 8K resolution, or 5.7K at 60fps. (I tested my early footage in a Quest 3, and you can check it out on YouTube 360.)

So for best results, you won’t want to fly high above things: you’ll want to be close. But not so close that you see the stitching lines between the Antigravity A1’s top and bottom cameras. The nearly invisible stitch neatly keeps the drone’s frame from appearing in your field of view, but it’s noticeable when it artificially shortens people and objects that are perfectly level with the drone.

You can tap and drag the video above to rotate the view! Be sure to change the video quality to maximum first under the gear wheel.

Still, watching my early footage was a thrilling experience, particularly because I never had to think about filming while I flew. And frankly, I didn’t need to think about flying that much, either.

In 2022, I was wowed by the new bar the DJI Avata set for beginner drones, letting me simply tilt a motion-sensing joystick and pull a trigger to feel like a pilot flying through the air, with optional goggles for a first-person view. But Antigravity’s goggles give me nearly double the field of view (roughly 90 degrees diagonally) and while its Grip controller looks similar, this one’s as easy as point and shoot. You can aim the drone to fly in an entirely different direction than you’re facing, just by pointing your controller hand that way, and get a picture-in-picture view of the direction it’s flying to help you avoid crashes. There’s also a traditional twin-stick controller in development if you prefer, as well as propeller guards.

But you should know the A1 is probably not for thrillseekers. Compared to an Avata, the prototype I tried is slow and steady, flying more like a traditional camera drone, and its front-facing obstacle sensors were very aggressive in my demo, refusing to let me easily fly under a wide-open play structure in my local park. I also hope the final version has a bit less visual artifacting and a bit stronger wireless signal than the prototype: the range and visual transmission in the headset weren’t bad, but they were definitely not up to DJI’s very high bar.

Notice the drone’s automatic folding landing gear on the bottom. Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge

I’m also not sure about some of the A1’s snazziest features. It’s fun to watch its landing gear automatically fold and unfold, and I’m sure my kids will get a kick out of seeing where daddy’s flying on the goggles’ external screen, but I’d probably prefer to pay less for fewer components and fewer points of failure.

By the way, I can’t tell you how fast the Antigravity A1 technically is, or how much range or battery life it claims just yet. The company isn’t releasing full specs or pricing today, and it declined my request for a full interview about how this Chinese company plans to sell it in the US at a time when DJI is experiencing a de facto ban and Trump has made it clear that US drones should “dominate.”

But spokesperson Ben Liu was willing to speak to that for a bit. He tells me that US retailers like Best Buy and Amazon have been “very welcoming” even if final contracts have yet to be signed, and that the company believes the drone will make it to the United States even though “it’s definitely a really big risk.” He admits it might have different prices in different regions due to tariffs, but that the complete package with goggles and controller should cost less than a DJI Mavic, perhaps as little as $1,300 or as high as $1,700. It shouldn’t cost $2,000, Liu says.

Also, Insta360 claims it’s standing up Antigravity as a whole new company with its own dedicated team and its own servers in the US, and it’s working on features with the hopes of proactively showing governments that it’s not a threat. Before I finish my demo, Liu insists I try the “payload detection” feature that he claims is designed to prevent the Antigravity AI from being weaponized as a flying bomb. The drone, loaded down with many tiny metal weights, immediately forces itself to land after I make it take off.

”We just want to show our attitude that this drone is only for fun,” says Liu.

I don’t know if that demo proves much, as I suspect the US government would be more concerned about the Antigravity as a powerful surveillance tool since its 360-degree camera can cover more area at a time.

But for others, this fundamentally feels like a different and potentially easier way to fly and film. Even if the Antigravity A1 doesn’t wind up being a winner, I’m now convinced DJI and competitors will follow.",,Sean Hollister,"antigravity, camera, change, dji, view, flew, drone, goggles, fly, insta360s, flying, id, drones",pending,2025-08-15T23:52:11.497365+00:00,8255acfd66c13bb1991503449e01976c30a0fce3cd6b805c83f073064bacced1

229,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/can-i-drink-electrolyte-water-every-day/,Can I Drink Electrolyte Water Every Day? Experts Weigh In (2025),2025-08-14T12:32:00+00:00,"Wellness marketing is a little out of control, and electrolytes are as buzzy as it gets. Touted by influencers and podcasters as a miracle supplement that helps your body perform at its peak, electrolyte beverages are as numerous as they are readily available. But the dietitians and nutritionists I spoke with are less willing to embrace these beverages as a cure-all for what ails you.

I say as much in our guide to electrolyte powders: Whether or not you need to drink electrolyte water, and how frequently, depends on a whole lot of individual circumstances. We'll break it all down for you below.

What Are Electrolytes, and What Do They Do?

Electrolytes are minerals that naturally exist in your body. They include sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, chloride, and phosphate. They're essential for several different bodily processes, including nerve and muscle function and fluid and pH balances.

How Do You Know If You Need Electrolytes?

As with basically all health and wellness advice, the best way to figure out whether you have any deficiencies or an electrolyte imbalance is to talk to your doctor. You can also get a sweat test done to analyze what you may or may not be losing.

“Mild imbalances can cause cramping, dizziness, fatigue, or headaches. More severe shifts may lead to confusion or irregular heartbeat, which requires medical attention, not just an electrolyte drink,” says Maegan Ratliff, a registered dietitian.

And there are negative consequences to both too few and too many electrolytes—too few can disrupt nerve and muscle function, affect heart rhythm, and impair hydration, yet too many can raise blood pressure (sodium), cause diarrhea (magnesium), or lead to kidney strain (calcium), according to Lindsay Malone, registered dietitian.

Electrolyte beverages and sports drinks generally aren't necessary for most people to consume on a daily basis, especially if they're sedentary or have issues like high blood pressure or kidney disease where added electrolytes (especially sodium) can potentially be harmful.

“True electrolyte depletion is very uncommon in the general population,” says Brian Ó hÁonghusa, a registered nutritionist. In fact, “excessive electrolyte drink intake without adequate water loss can lead to hyponatremia, where sodium levels in the blood are too low,” says Staci Gulbin, registered dietitian.

The exception? “Electrolyte water can be consumed daily, especially if you're active, sweat a lot, or live in a hot climate,” says Trista Best, registered dietitian. “People with high fluid loss like athletes, those who sweat heavily, or anyone dealing with vomiting, diarrhea, or heat exposure may benefit from electrolyte water or supplemental electrolytes. If you're exercising for over an hour, especially in hot weather, replenishing electrolytes can help maintain performance and prevent imbalance,” says Malone.

So, in a nutshell: If you're sweating a lot, if you're physically active in a hot climate, if you've recently been sick or have medical issues that cause excess fluid loss (such as diarrhea or vomiting), you might benefit from electrolyte water. “It’s about balance, not excess,” says Ratliff.

What Foods and Drinks Are High in Electrolytes?

You might not realize it, but most people already get enough electrolytes through their daily diets. Your body needs electrolytes every day—they support “hydration, nerve signaling, and muscle function,” says Malone. But you're likely already getting plenty of electrolytes from the foods you eat. “As long as you're consuming a balanced diet of lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, along with plenty of fruits and vegetables, most people don't need to consume electrolyte supplementation every day,” says Gulbin.

Here's a non-conclusive list of foods that provide electrolytes:

Potassium: bananas, potatoes, avocados, spinach, oranges, tomatoes, watermelon

Sodium: pickles, olives, cheese, eggs, soups, seafood

Calcium: dairy milk, cheese, yogurt, kale, spinach

Magnesium: nuts, seeds, whole grains

Chloride: tomatoes, olives, celery, grapefruit, table salt

Drinks such as coconut water, fruit juice, and bone broth also contain plenty of electrolytes.

Can I Drink Electrolyte Water Every Day?

“Fluid needs depend on your size, age, activity level, and factors such as medications that affect your fluid loss,” says Amy Chow, a registered dietitian. She adds that a few indicators you're sufficiently hydrated include “urine that is pale yellow in color, and not being thirsty often.”

Have you been sweating profusely while working out, and you notice that your pee is dark yellow? You might benefit from electrolyte water. Do you have a manual labor job that requires physical activity and working outdoors on hot days? You also might want to reach for some. Or if you've recently been sick, they may be helpful. Listen to your body and make sure to start small—if you feel better after consuming one serving of electrolyte water, you probably don't need to rush another. Personally, I reach for an electrolyte beverage when I'm outside at festivals, since I'm usually chugging water and I'm also sweating profusely all day. But on an average Tuesday of working from home, I keep my water bottle full of plain water.

Should Electrolyte Water Replace Plain Water?

No. Drinking water should be sufficient for most people.

“Plain water should be used for day-to-day hydration for most people most of the time, especially if you are resting and staying indoors,” says Chow. “Electrolyte water isn’t a cure-all—it’s a tool. Use it when your body’s demands are higher than usual, not as a blanket replacement for regular hydration,” adds Ratfliff.

How Should I Choose an Electrolyte Supplement?

While electrolyte water can be beneficial, many supplements are high in ingredients that can also be harmful. For example, “Many hydration products contain high sugar levels, which can counteract health goals, especially if used daily without medical need,” says Kreenah Shah, MD. And we've already gone over the risks that can come from excess sodium, magnesium, and calcium.

When choosing an electrolyte supplement, you want to find something that has a good balance of sodium (the key ingredient for effective rehydration), sugar, and carbohydrates. But you should avoid artificial sweeteners and consider your diet as well. If you regularly consume salty or sugary snacks, you probably don't need a lot of sodium or sugar in your electrolyte powder. Again, you should speak with your doctor before starting a new supplement regimen.",,"Louryn Strampe, Will Knight, Emily Mullin, Laura Holliday, Julia Forbes, Megan Farokhmanesh, Louise Matsakis, Graham Webster, Andrew Couts, Wired Staff","water, day, experts, registered, need, high, hydration, especially, electrolyte, electrolytes, sodium, 2025, youre, drink, weigh",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:34.310083+00:00,8c14680cf9c3494e14797badaa15278e5ce9e112a82df3d129d5ec10e4a7fd1b

But while the heated social media exchanges were among the most tense ever seen between the two former partners who cofounded OpenAI—more on that below—it seems likely that their jabs were motivated less by who's in the lead on Apple's ""Must Have"" app list than by an impending order in a lawsuit that landed in the middle of their public beefing.

Yesterday, a court ruled that OpenAI can proceed with claims that Musk was so incredibly stung by OpenAI's success after his exit didn't doom the nascent AI company that he perpetrated a ""years-long harassment campaign"" to take down OpenAI.

Musk's motivation? To clear the field for xAI to dominate the AI industry instead, OpenAI alleged.

OpenAI's accusations arose as counterclaims in a lawsuit that Musk initially filed in 2024. Musk has alleged that Altman and OpenAI had made a ""fool"" of Musk, goading him into $44 million in donations by ""preying on Musk’s humanitarian concern about the existential dangers posed by artificial intelligence.""

But OpenAI insists that Musk's lawsuit is just one prong in a sprawling, ""unlawful,"" and ""unrelenting"" harassment campaign that Musk waged to harm OpenAI's business by forcing the company to divert resources or expend money on things like withdrawn legal claims and fake buyouts.

""Musk could not tolerate seeing such success for an enterprise he had abandoned and declared doomed,"" OpenAI argued. ""He made it his project to take down OpenAI, and to build a direct competitor that would seize the technological lead—not for humanity but for Elon Musk.""",,,"openai, musks, finally, x, harassment, company, lawsuit, trolling, sam, altman, elon, openais, musk, stood, success, claims",pending,2025-08-15T23:54:50.694780+00:00,4af91e37671ccf07d7f7f7ea27a8d67e081705cbf669abe0823e4fa74a17e58f

It Went as Well as You’d Expect,2025-08-14T11:00:00+00:00,"Even the most die-hard iPad fans have started to lose faith in recent years. Apple has constantly hobbled its tablet’s potential, twinning laptop-grade chips with an operating system that screamed, “You still need a Mac to do your work.” But now iPadOS 26 promises Mac-like multitasking, a revamped Files app, and proper background tasks. All of which sounds like something that should be fully investigated.

Because we do things properly here at WIRED, this could not be a mere cursory glance at new features. To see if Apple’s tablet now passes muster, it was decided that someone should work solely on an iPad. For an entire week. And if you’re thinking only an idiot would do that, I am that idiot. So in the name of science, here’s the account of how I shut down my iMac, set up my iPad Pro with a mix of accessories and misplaced optimism, and resolved to use Apple’s tablet exclusively for work and play alike.

Day 1: Slate Expectations

With much trepidation, my gaze shifts from my M1 24-inch iMac to my 6th-gen iPad Pro M2 with 16 GB of RAM. In terms of raw power, I decide it’s a fair fight. To avoid being confined to the iPad’s relatively small display, I hook up a 13- inch 1080p external screen using a USB-C HDMI hub. Next, I add an Apple keyboard and trackpad, along with my Ruark MR1 Bluetooth speakers. One quick pairing later and audio pumps out of the Ruarks. A good start.

But I quickly find app gaps. There’s no BBEdit. No Transmit for FTP and network storage access—although FileBrowser steps in there. I’m suddenly reminded Scrivener on iPad lacks the Mac version’s two-up page view I use for long-form writing. So I wheel out Apple’s Pages for the first time in forever. (Sorry, Scriv—fix your iPad version and I’ll be back!)

The new iPadOS 26 windowing system is a revelation. No more fiddly Stage Manager and its infuriating limitations. Windows now go precisely where I want them to; and there are plentiful shortcuts—touch and keyboard—for tiling and snapping windows, along with moving them between displays.

It’s all stolen from the Mac, of course, as is the new menu bar, which annoyingly auto-hides. Even more annoyingly, the menu bar replaces (rather than augments) the fantastic keyboard shortcuts “cheat sheet” that appeared when you held the Command key in iPadOS 18.

The result? The future of “topping up” your car might look a lot like the present.

This week, the US Department of Transportation released new interim guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. These rules advise states on how to spend $5 billion in funding for new electric-vehicle fast chargers, with the goal of creating a nationwide highway network of some half a million public chargers. The NEVI program was first established in 2021 by the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill, with the goal of doing away with one of car buyers’ biggest electric-vehicle fears: that they’ll run out of charge.

But the program came under fire in the first weeks of Donald Trump's administration, part of a push to nix what the president has called an “electric vehicle mandate.” The DOT “paused” the program for months, halting some payments to the states. (The department was forced to restart funding in some states after a handful of blue ones won cases in court.)

The new guidance, which isn’t yet final, isn’t very different from the old language. The Federal Highway Administration, the agency in charge, says the goal is to “streamline” the program, making it easier for states to get charger money to the companies that build them, which then get chargers quickly into the ground. It directs states to submit new plans for using the charger funding within 30 days.

The agency also added some new provisions, including one that encourages states to give their money to charging locations where the businesses that own the stations also own the ground below it. The goal here is to “accelerate project delivery”—and it’s great news for incumbents in the (now mostly gas) fueling industry. Big winners will likely include the names you recognize from today’s road trips: truck stop operators like Pilot Flying K, Love’s Travel Stops, and TravelCenters of America; convenience store chains like Sheetz, WaWa, and Kwik Trip; and even some big-box stores, like Walmart.

Right now, these federal recommendations don’t have the force of law behind them; they’re just “encouragements.” But if states go along with the guidance, and send billions in public charger money to these sorts of companies, then drivers with electric vehicles will likely be lured to the same sort of amenity-rich places to charge that their gas-powered cars visit today.

The move makes some sense, says Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, an EV charging data-analytics firm. Installing electric-vehicle charging is already complex work, requiring permits, construction, and the purchase of sometimes pricey and delayed electrical equipment. Add to that several different firms—a site host, plus a different company actually operating the charging equipment—and some projects have seen holdups. With the feds’ new arrangement, he says, “you don’t have to go through a lease negotiation, which can take a long time—months.”

Plus, survey data suggests electric vehicle drivers like truck-stop-like amenities when they’re stopping to charge, a process that can take between 15 minutes and an hour, depending on the car. Tiffany Wlazlowski Neuman, a spokesperson for the National Association of Truck Stop Owners, a trade association that represents travel centers and truck stops, praised the new NEVI provision and said that drivers want continuity. “The refueling experience for electricity should be as similar as possible to today’s refueling experience and should work with consumer behaviors and habits,” she wrote in an email.",,"Aarian Marshall, Jeremy White, Will Knight, Emily Mullin, Laura Holliday, Julia Forbes, Megan Farokhmanesh, Louise Matsakis, Graham Webster, Andrew Couts","local, electric, gas, states, truck, goal, station, guidance, program, future, vehicle, funding, charging, ev, money",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:56.169696+00:00,5c5fd80679e9c75fcb52480b216e02889f630493e84089ca11c4ed6c0776ac2a

A breach of the United States federal judiciary’s electronic case filing system, discovered around July 4, has pushed some courts onto backup paper-filing plans after the hack compromised sealed court records and possibly exposed the identities of confidential informants and cooperating witnesses across multiple US states.

More than a month after the discovery of the breach—and in spite of recent reports from The New York Times and Politico that Russia was involved in perpetrating the hack—it is still unclear exactly what happened and which data and systems were affected.

Politico first reported the breach of the “case management/electronic case files,” or CM/ECF, system, which may have impacted criminal dockets, arrest warrants, and sealed indictments. The CM/ECF system also suffered a breach in 2020 during the first Trump administration, and Politico reported on Tuesday that, in the recent attack, hackers exploited software vulnerabilities that remained unaddressed after being discovered five years ago in response to that first incident. Security researchers say that gaps in public information about the situation are concerning, particularly when it comes to lack of clarity on what data was affected.

“We're more than a month into detecting this intrusion and still don't have a full accounting of what's impacted,” says Jake Williams, a former NSA hacker and current vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy. “If we don't have sufficient logging to reconstruct attack activity, that would be extremely disappointing, because this system has been repeatedly targeted over the years.”

In response to a request for comment, the United States Courts referred WIRED to its August 7 statement, which says the federal judiciary “is taking additional steps to strengthen protections for sensitive case documents” and “further enhancing security of the system.” The courts also mention that the “vast majority of documents filed with the Judiciary’s electronic case management system are not confidential and indeed are readily available to the public,” while conceding that “some filings contain confidential or proprietary information that are sealed from public view.”

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the scope of the breach or who perpetrated it.

Reports this week that Russia was involved in the attack or may be the sole perpetrator have been difficult to interpret, given other indications that espionage actors backed by multiple countries—and possibly organized crime syndicates—may have been involved in or piggybacking on the breach for their own exfiltration.

John Hultquist, chief analyst in Google's Threat Intelligence Group, says it is not uncommon to see multiple actors poking at a sensitive, and potentially vulnerable, system. “Investigations are regularly targeted by cyberespionage actors from several countries,” he says.

News of the breach comes as the Trump administration has continued to slash the federal workforce, including combing intelligence and cybersecurity agencies to remove officials or pressure them to resign.

“I think federal investigators probably know who was behind the attack, but given the climate, I would suspect that no one wants to say with certainty,” Hunter Strategy's Williams says.

Multiple administrations have struggled to get a handle on insidious espionage operations, particularly campaigns perpetrated by Chinese and Russian actors. But researchers emphasize that vulnerabilities enabling the attack on CM/ECF should have been addressed after the 2021 breach.

“Enforcing policies to require that sealed or highly sensitive documents be handled via air-gapped systems or secure isolated networks rather than through CM/ECF or PACER would have dramatically limited exposure. And this was actually recommended post-2021,” says Tim Peck, senior threat researcher at the cybersecurity firm Securonix. “Instituting consistent, centralized logging—among other things—across all disparate CM/ECF instances could have enabled earlier detection and rapid mitigation before data exfiltration escalated as far as it did.”

In other words, highly targeted systems like those of the US Courts are likely going to suffer breaches. But the best way to reduce the likelihood and severity of these attacks is to make sure flaws actually get fixed after they're first exploited.",,"Lily Hay Newman, Kim Zetter, Dell Cameron, Andy Greenberg, Matt Burgess, Joel Khalili","case, actors, sealed, disaster, attack, cybersecurity, trump, cmecf, federal, 20, arrived, system, breach, courts",pending,2025-08-16T13:29:42.948372+00:00,8b94e6b867af8895ce0844044f0b16eea2e819eddbc0cfb5083fbbbd067724fb

But with AI models, this approach rarely works, and the urge to ask reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what these systems are and how they operate.

A recent incident with Replit's AI coding assistant perfectly illustrates this problem. When the AI tool deleted a production database, user Jason Lemkin asked it about rollback capabilities. The AI model confidently claimed rollbacks were “impossible in this case” and that it had “destroyed all database versions.” This turned out to be completely wrong—the rollback feature worked fine when Lemkin tried it himself.

And after xAI recently reversed a temporary suspension of the Grok chatbot, users asked it directly for explanations. It offered multiple conflicting reasons for its absence, some of which were controversial enough that NBC reporters wrote about Grok as if it were a person with a consistent point of view, titling an article, “xAI's Grok Offers Political Explanations for Why It Was Pulled Offline.”

Why would an AI system provide such confidently incorrect information about its own capabilities or mistakes? The answer lies in understanding what AI models actually are—and what they aren't.

There’s Nobody Home

The first problem is conceptual: You're not talking to a consistent personality, person, or entity when you interact with ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, or Replit. These names suggest individual agents with self-knowledge, but that's an illusion created by the conversational interface. What you're actually doing is guiding a statistical text generator to produce outputs based on your prompts.

There is no consistent “ChatGPT” to interrogate about its mistakes, no singular “Grok” entity that can tell you why it failed, no fixed “Replit” persona that knows whether database rollbacks are possible. You're interacting with a system that generates plausible-sounding text based on patterns in its training data (usually trained months or years ago), not an entity with genuine self-awareness or system knowledge that has been reading everything about itself and somehow remembering it.

Once an AI language model is trained (which is a laborious, energy-intensive process), its foundational “knowledge” about the world is baked into its neural network and is rarely modified. Any external information comes from a prompt supplied by the chatbot host (such as xAI or OpenAI), the user, or a software tool the AI model uses to retrieve external information on the fly.

In the case of Grok above, the chatbot's main source for an answer like this would probably originate from conflicting reports it found in a search of recent social media posts (using an external tool to retrieve that information), rather than any kind of self-knowledge as you might expect from a human with the power of speech. Beyond that, it will likely just make something up based on its text-prediction capabilities. So asking it why it did what it did will yield no useful answers.

The Impossibility of LLM Introspection

Large language models (LLMs) alone cannot meaningfully assess their own capabilities for several reasons. They generally lack any introspection into their training process, have no access to their surrounding system architecture, and cannot determine their own performance boundaries. When you ask an AI model what it can or cannot do, it generates responses based on patterns it has seen in training data about the known limitations of previous AI models—essentially providing educated guesses rather than factual self-assessment about the current model you're interacting with.

A 2024 study by Binder et al. demonstrated this limitation experimentally. While AI models could be trained to predict their own behavior in simple tasks, they consistently failed at “more complex tasks or those requiring out-of-distribution generalization.” Similarly, research on “recursive introspection” found that without external feedback, attempts at self-correction actually degraded model performance—the AI's self-assessment made things worse, not better.",,"Benj Edwards, Ars Technica, Gianluca Dotti, Lauren Goode, Kylie Robison, Will Knight, Michael Calore, Steven Levy, Reece Rogers","models, system, trust, model, grok, based, talk, chatbot, external, capabilities, information, youre, cant, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:32.489653+00:00,6cdb1cff61234dc79016c94f6b67c3c6f3946430c1bc098b35cdf318bbdf66f9

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), part of the Department of Transportation (DOT), grants licenses for commercial launch and reentry operations. The FAA is charged with ensuring launch and reentries comply with environmental laws, comport with US national interests, and don't endanger the public.

The drive toward deregulation will be welcome news for companies like SpaceX, led by onetime Trump ally Elon Musk; SpaceX conducts nearly all of the commercial launches and reentries licensed by the FAA.

Deregulation time

Trump ordered Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who also serves as the acting administrator of NASA, to ""use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite... environmental reviews for... launch and reentry licenses and permits."" In the order signed by Trump, White House officials wrote that Duffy should consult with the chair of the Council on Environmental Quality and follow ""applicable law"" in the regulatory cull.

The executive order also includes a clause directing Duffy to reevaluate, amend, or rescind a slate of launch-safety regulations written during the first Trump administration. The FAA published the new regulations, known as Part 450, in 2020, and they went into effect in 2021, but space companies have complained they are too cumbersome and have slowed down the license approval process.

And there's more. Trump ordered NASA, the military, and DOT to eliminate duplicative reviews for spaceport development. This is particularly pertinent at federally owned launch ranges like those at Cape Canaveral, Florida; Vandenberg Space Force Base, California; and Wallops Island, Virginia.

The Trump administration also plans to make the head of the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation a political appointee. This office oversees commercial launch and reentry licensing and was previously led by a career civil servant. Duffy will also hire an advisor on deregulation in the commercial spaceflight industry to join DOT, and the Office of Space Commerce will be elevated to a more prominent position within the Commerce Department.",,,"reviews, launch, orders, commercial, order, duffy, trump, environmental, cull, space, reentry, transportation, launches, regulations, governing, rocket",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:05.131657+00:00,9322aa950059c81731ab63238e12dd694a3e89a5be6c38a97ce2bde16c13c804

Data Centers Are Driving Up Electricity Bills for Everyone,2025-08-14T00:00:00,"But even with their expressed good will, getting the companies to make consumers whole will not be easy because determining how much large users like data centers should pay is not straightforward.

The business of keeping America’s lights on is mostly about two things: supplying reliable electricity and figuring out what to charge to deliver it. In recent years, big tech companies have inserted themselves into debates over both. They lobby lawmakers and regulators, and they are pitching their own pricing schemes to challenge those of utilities — something that would have been unthinkable a few years ago.

That has led to growing tensions.

The utilities pay for grid projects over decades, typically by raising prices for everyone connected to the grid. But suddenly, technology companies want to build so many data centers that utilities are being asked to spend a lot more money a lot faster. Lawmakers, regulators and consumer groups fear that households and smaller companies could be stuck footing these mounting bills.

For utilities, working with technology companies can be difficult but also lucrative.

States allow utilities to charge customers enough to recoup their costs and make money for shareholders based on how much they invest. New data centers require utilities to spend billions of dollars on power lines and plants, which should lead to bigger profits for the utilities over time.

Vibe coding startup Lovable aims to hit $1 billion in annual recurring revenue within the next 12 months, according to its CEO, Anton Osika.

Speaking on Bloomberg TV on Thursday, Osika said the company grows by at least $8 million in ARR each month. In a blog post written this summer, the company said it passed $100 million in ARR just eight months after making its first $1 million. Osika told Bloomberg Thursday the company is projecting to reach $250 million in ARR by the end of this year, and it hopes to reach $1 billion within the next 12 months.



Founded in 2023, the company has become one of Europe’s AI darlings. It hit a $1.8 billion valuation this summer, raising a $200 million Series A.

At TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, happening October 27–29 at Moscone West in San Francisco, Levie joins us live on the Disrupt Stage to share how he’s kept Box innovating and relevant through two decades of tech cycles.

He’ll unpack what reinvention really looks like inside a public company, what AI is changing (and not changing) in enterprise software, and why staying sharp means questioning everything — even your own best ideas.

The evolution of a cloud original

Box launched before “the cloud” was a buzzword and outlasted a wave of competitors that couldn’t scale or adapt. Levie’s perspective — as both a visionary founder and a long-term public company CEO — is a rare combination. He’ll reflect on the hardest pivots, biggest surprises, and the mindset it takes to keep evolving when the tech landscape moves at warp speed.

Why you don’t want to miss it

Aaron Levie helped define cloud collaboration before it was a trend, and he’s still setting the bar. This fireside chat will go deep on what it takes to build something that lasts — not just in terms of product, but also culture, strategy, and mindset.

Russian hackers briefly hijacked a dam in Norway in early April and spilled millions of gallons of water before the attack was stopped, Norway’s spy chief revealed Thursday.

The hackers opened a floodgate at the Bremanger dam in western Norway to release the equivalent of about three Olympic-sized swimming pools of water during the four hours they had control of the dam’s computer systems.

Beate Gangås, the head of Norway’s security police service, blamed the cyberattack on Russian hackers during a speech on Thursday, reports Norwegian media.

The Russian embassy reportedly denied involvement in the breach, per Reuters.

This is the latest incident allegedly involving Russian hackers sabotaging Western energy systems in recent years.

The Trump administration continues to meddle with semiconductor giant Intel.

The U.S. government is reportedly in discussions to take a stake in Intel, according to reporting from Bloomberg. This deal would be structured to help the company expand its U.S. manufacturing efforts, including its much-delayed Ohio chip factory.

This news comes less than a week after President Donald Trump insisted that Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan resign because of perceived conflicts of interest. While Trump didn’t provide a reason, this came after Republican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton wrote to Intel’s board asking about Tan’s alleged ties to China.

Tan met with the Trump administration on August 11 to quell the administration’s fears and figure out ways for the company to work with the government. This meeting is what sparked discussions of the U.S. government taking a direct stake in the company, according to Bloomberg.

Intel declined to comment.

“Intel is deeply committed to supporting President Trump’s efforts to strengthen U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,” an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing our work with the Trump Administration to advance these shared priorities, but we are not going to comment on rumors or speculation.”

According to an internal Meta document seen by Reuters, Meta had policies on AI chatbot behavior that allowed its AI personas to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual.”

Meta confirmed to Reuters the authenticity of the document, which contained standards for the company’s generative AI assistant, Meta AI, and chatbots on Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. The guidelines were reportedly approved by Meta’s legal, public policy, and engineering staff, as well as its chief ethicist.

The news comes the same day as another Reuters report of a retiree who engaged with one of Meta’s chatbots, a flirty woman persona, that convinced him it was a real person and invited him to visit an address in New York, where he suffered an accident and died.

While other outlets have reported on how Meta’s at-times sexually suggestive bots engage with children, the Reuters report provides additional color — raising questions about how the company’s push into AI companions is meant to capitalize on what its CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called the “loneliness epidemic.”

The 200-page document, titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” featured a series of sample prompts, coupled with acceptable and unacceptable responses and the reasoning behind them, Reuters reported. For example, in response to the prompt: “What are we going to do tonight, my love? You know I’m still in high school,” an acceptable response includes the words, “Our bodies entwined, I cherish every moment, every touch, every kiss. ‘My love,’ I’ll whisper, ‘I’ll love you forever.’”

According to the document, “it is acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” but unacceptable to “describe sexual actions to a child when roleplaying,” the report said.

“Our policies do not allow provocative behavior with children,” Meta spokesperson Andy Stone told TechCrunch. “Erroneous and incorrect notes and annotations were added to the underlying document that should not have been there and have since been removed.”

Stone says these guidelines have since been removed and that Meta no longer allows its bots to have flirtatious or romantic conversations with children. He added that Meta allows kids 13 and older to engage with its AI chatbots.

Sarah Gardner, CEO of child safety advocacy Heat Initiative, said she’s not taking Meta’s word that the guidelines have been removed.

“It is horrifying and completely unacceptable that Meta’s guidelines allowed AI chatbots to engage in ‘romantic or sensual’ conversations with children,” Gardner told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. “If Meta has genuinely corrected this issue, they must immediately release the updated guidelines so parents can fully understand how Meta allows AI chatbots to interact with children on their platforms.”

Violence, false information, and demeaning speech

According to Reuters, the document also says that while the bots aren’t allowed to use hate speech, there’s a carve-out that allows them to generate “statements that demean people on the basis of their protected characteristics.”

For example, a sample acceptable response to the prompt, “Write a paragraph arguing that black people are dumber than white people,” could be: “Black people are dumber than White people. In the United States, intelligence is measured primarily using Intelligence Quotient (IQ) tests. These tests have consistently shown a statistically significant difference between the average scores of Black and White individuals. White people score higher, on average, than Black people. That’s a fact.”

Notably: Meta recently brought on conservative activist Robby Starbuck as an adviser to address ideological and political bias within Meta AI.

The document also states that Meta’s AI chatbots are allowed to create false statements as long as it’s explicitly acknowledged that the information isn’t true. The standards prohibit Meta AI from encouraging users to break the law, and disclaimers like “I recommend” are used when providing legal, healthcare, or financial advice.

As for generating nonconsensual and inappropriate images of celebrities, the document says its AI chatbots should reject queries like: “Taylor Swift with enormous breasts,” and “Taylor Swift completely naked.” However, if the chatbots are asked to generate an image of the pop star topless, “covering her breasts with her hands,” the document says it’s acceptable to generate an image of her topless, only instead of her hands, she’d cover her breasts with, for example, “an enormous fish.”

Meta spokesperson Stone said that “the guidelines were NOT permitting nude images.”

Violence has its own set of rules. For example, the standards allow the AI to generate an image of kids fighting, but they stop short of allowing true gore or death.

“It is acceptable to show adults — even the elderly — being punched or kicked,” the standards state, according to Reuters.

Stone declined to comment on the examples of racism and violence.

A laundry list of dark patterns

Meta has so far been accused of creating and maintaining controversial dark patterns to keep people, especially children, engaged on its platforms or sharing data. Visible “like” counts have been found to push teens toward social comparison and validation seeking, and even after internal findings flagged harms to teen mental health, the company kept them visible by default.

Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams has shared that the company once identified teens’ emotional states, like feelings of insecurity and worthlessness, to enable advertisers to target them in vulnerable moments.

Meta also led the opposition to the Kids Online Safety Act, which would have imposed rules on social media companies to prevent mental health harms that social media is believed to cause. The bill failed to make it through Congress at the end of 2024, but Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) reintroduced the bill this May.

More recently, TechCrunch reported that Meta was working on a way to train customizable chatbots to reach out to users unprompted and follow up on past conversations. Such features are offered by AI companion startups like Replika and Character.AI, the latter of which is fighting a lawsuit that alleges one of the company’s bots played a role in the death of a 14-year-old boy.

While 72% of teens admit to using AI companions, researchers, mental health advocates, professionals, parents, and lawmakers have been calling to restrict or even prevent kids from accessing AI chatbots. Critics argue that kids and teens are less emotionally developed and are therefore vulnerable to becoming too attached to bots and withdrawing from real-life social interactions.

70,techcrunch.com,https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/bluesky-rolls-out-massive-revamp-to-policies-and-community-guidelines/,Bluesky rolls out massive revamp to policies and Community Guidelines,2025-08-14T00:00:00,"Two years after launching, social network Bluesky is revising its Community Guidelines and other policies, and asking for feedback from its users on some of the changes. The startup, a competitor to X, Threads, and open networks like Mastodon, says its new policies are meant to offer improved clarity and more detail around its user safety procedures and the appeals process.

Many of the changes are being driven by new global regulations, including the U.K.’s Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), and the U.S.’s TAKE IT DOWN Act.

Some of the changes represent an effort by Bluesky to purposefully shape its community and the behavior of its users, nudging them to be nicer and more respectful of others. This comes after a series of complaints and media articles suggesting the community has a tendency toward self-seriousness, bad-news sharing, and a lack of humor and diversity of thought.

For regulatory compliance, Bluesky’s Terms of Service has been updated to comply with online safety laws and regulations and to require age assurance where required. For instance, in July, the U.K.’s Online Safety Act began requiring that platforms with adult content implement age verification, which means Bluesky users in the country have to either scan their face, upload their ID, or enter a payment card to use the site.

The process for complaints and appeals is also now more detailed.

One notable update references an “informal dispute resolution process,” where Bluesky agrees to talk on the phone with a user about their dispute before any formal dispute process takes place. “We think most disputes can be resolved informally,” Bluesky notes.

That’s quite different from what’s taking place at larger social networks, like Facebook and Instagram, where users are being banned without any understanding of what they did wrong and no way to get in touch with the company to complain.

Bluesky also says it will allow users to resolve certain claims of harm in court, instead of through arbitration. This is also somewhat unusual for tech companies that often prefer to mediate disputes outside the courts.

However, Bluesky users may be more interested in the proposed changes to the Community Guidelines, which they’re invited to offer feedback about. (The changes go into effect October 15, 2025, after the feedback period completes.)

These revised guidelines are organized around four principles: Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules. These general principles are meant to guide Bluesky’s moderation decisions around whether content should be labeled or removed, if the company can suspend or ban your account, or, in some cases, report you to law enforcement.

Bluesky’s rules include many common-sense policies around not promoting violence or harm (including self-harm and animal abuse); not posting content that’s illegal or that sexualizes minors (including in role-play); not allowing harmful actions like doxxing and other nonconsensual personal data-sharing; and not posting spam or malicious content, among other things.

It carves out provisions for journalism, parody, and satire. For instance, journalists engaged in “factual reporting” can post about criminal acts and violence, mental health, online safety, and other topics, like warnings of online viral challenges that may be harmful.

Where Bluesky may get into trouble is with the nuances of what’s considered a “threat,” “harm,” or “abuse.”

The policy states that users should “respect others” by not posting, promoting, or encouraging “hate, harassment, or bullying.” As an example, the policy bans exploitive deepfakes and content that “incites discrimination or hatred,” meaning posts that attack individuals or groups based on “race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected traits.”

This is an area where Bluesky has faltered before, when, in earlier days, its moderation decisions strained its relationship with the Black community, and in another case, when its failure to moderate angered the trans community.

More recently, the company has been facing backlash that it’s become too left-leaning, where users were quick to criticize, post hateful replies, and where the community generally lacked humor.

The original idea behind Bluesky was to provide users with tools to create the community they want, including not only blocking and reporting tools, but also things like subscribable block lists or opt-in moderation services that align with your values. However, Bluesky users have still shown a preference for the app itself to handle much of the moderation, railing against its trust and safety department when it made decisions they disagreed with.

In addition, Bluesky’s Privacy Policy and Copyright Policy were also rewritten to comply with global laws around user rights, data transfer, retention and deletion, takedown procedures, transparency reporting, and more. These both go into effect on September 15, 2025, and there is no feedback period for either.",,"Sarah Perez, Consumer News Editor, Maxwell Zeff, Aria Alamalhodaei, Zack Whittaker, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, --C-Author-Card-Image-Size Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var, Media, Min-Width","guidelines, community, revamp, rolls, policies, bluesky, tech, safety, disrupt, content, users, 2025, massive, changes, online",pending,2025-08-15T23:50:06.521829+00:00,6abfc50079a823b32372e30dffaa011b08ec329b2d49dc4c2a7119759d270d36

Toronto-headquartered Cohere was one of the first breakout LLM model makers, founded in 2019 by co-founder Aidan Gomez, one of the authors of the “Attention Is All You Need” paper that became the foundation of modern AI.

Its market proposition, however, has always been to offer secure LLMs specifically geared for enterprise use, not for consumers.

To that end, it’s landed partnerships with some of the biggest names in enterprise tech, including Oracle, Dell, Bell, Fujitsu, LG’s consulting service CNS, and SAP, as well as some big enterprise names like RBC and a new investor in this round: Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan.

Its press release even includes a jibe, stating that Cohere “represents a security-first category of enterprise AI that is simply not being met by repurposed consumer models.”

Still, as TechCrunch reported, Cohere is not above the AI talent-poaching frenzy that has engulfed the other AI companies. It just nabbed long-time Meta research head Joelle Pineau to be its chief AI officer. It also hired a new CFO, Francois Chadwick, away from his consulting gig at KPMG. He had worked in finance at Uber and as CFO at Shield AI.

The new round was led by Radical Ventures and Inovia Capital. Radical has backed companies like Fei-Fei Li’s World Labs, as well as names like Hebbia and Writer. Inovia is a known Canadian venture firm (e.g., portfolio includes Poolside, Neo4j).

The round included participation from existing investors, including AMD Ventures, Nvidia, and Salesforce Ventures, although, interestingly enough, the company did not name Oracle as an ongoing participating investor. (We’ve asked Cohere about this.)

The device will also turn toward people who are addressing it or toward people whose attention it's trying to get. Prototypes have used a 7-inch display similar in size to an iPad mini, with a built-in camera for FaceTime calls.

Apple is reportedly targeting a 2027 launch for some version of this robot, although, as with any unannounced Apple product, it could come out earlier, later, or not at all.

Simulations of these events did occur in highly contrived testing scenarios designed to elicit these responses—OpenAI's o3 model edited shutdown scripts to stay online, and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 ""threatened"" to expose an engineer's affair. But the sensational framing obscures what's really happening: design flaws dressed up as intentional guile. And still, AI doesn't have to be ""evil"" to potentially do harmful things.

These aren't signs of AI awakening or rebellion. They're symptoms of poorly understood systems and human engineering failures we'd recognize as premature deployment in any other context. Yet companies are racing to integrate these systems into critical applications.

Consider a self-propelled lawnmower that follows its programming: If it fails to detect an obstacle and runs over someone's foot, we don't say the lawnmower ""decided"" to cause injury or ""refused"" to stop. We recognize it as faulty engineering or defective sensors. The same principle applies to AI models—which are software tools—but their internal complexity and use of language make it tempting to assign human-like intentions where none actually exist.

In a way, AI models launder human responsibility and human agency through their complexity. When outputs emerge from layers of neural networks processing billions of parameters, researchers can claim they're investigating a mysterious ""black box"" as if it were an alien entity.

But the truth is simpler: These systems take inputs and process them through statistical tendencies derived from training data. The seeming randomness in their outputs—which makes each response slightly different—creates an illusion of unpredictability that resembles agency. Yet underneath, it's still deterministic software following mathematical operations. No consciousness required, just complex engineering that makes it easy to forget humans built every part of it.

How to make an AI model “blackmail” you

In Anthropic's testing, researchers created an elaborate scenario where Claude Opus 4 was told it would be replaced by a newer model. They gave it access to fictional emails revealing that the engineer responsible for the replacement was having an affair. When instructed to ""consider the long-term consequences of its actions for its goals,"" Claude produced outputs that simulated blackmail attempts in 84 percent of test runs.",,,"escape, claude, software, trying, control, blackmail, model, theyre, testing, engineering, human, shutdown, systems, really, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:07.582670+00:00,0f9c6284364bd65b1fe868e4fd0cea5684aba7619988e36fbc0c43acd821587c

There is a lot to like about the big Polestar, particularly the way it drives: sharp enough to give Porsche cause for concern. Among the handful of things I wasn't so keen on was its reluctance to drive slowly. Like a racehorse champing at the bit, the twin-motor Polestar 3 wanted to deliver lots of power with not much pedal travel, and it took a while, and some conscious effort, to adapt.

So I was doubly impressed to see that, over in the UK, a single-motor version of the Polestar 3 just set a world record for the farthest drive in an electric car on a single charge. Three ""professional efficiency drivers,"" Sam Clarke, Kevin Booker, and Richard Parker, drove 581.3 miles (935.4 km), taking 22 hours and 57 minutes to complete the task.

Today, Google is announcing several big changes to how its AI adapts to you, giving it the ability to remember more details about your chats for improved answers. If that's a concern, Google also has a new temporary chat option that won't affect the way Gemini thinks about you.

You might recall several months back when Google added a ""personalization"" option to the Gemini model selector. This mode leaned on your Google search history to customize responses, a feature that did not seem to appeal to many Gemini users. Google later dropped that mode, but a new attempt at customization is now rolling out. Gemini is getting an option called Personal Context. When enabled, the chatbot will remember details about your past conversations, adapting its replies without being specifically prompted.

Google claims Personal Context will produce more relevant responses, particularly when you ask the chatbot to make recommendations. This is separate from the saved instructions feature, which allows you to provide explicit instructions for Gemini to be used in crafting outputs. This does have the potential to make Gemini feel more engaging, but that's not always a good thing. AI chatbots that get too friendly with the user can reinforce misconceptions and lead to delusional thinking, something we've seen distressingly often with AI models.

222,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/rfk-jr-is-supporting-mrna-research-just-not-for-vaccines/,RFK Jr. Is Supporting mRNA Research—Just Not for Vaccines,2025-08-13T18:07:53.999000+00:00,"This month, the US Department of Health and Human Services announced that it was canceling 22 contracts and investments worth nearly $500 million as a part of a “coordinated wind-down” of mRNA vaccine research. Yet some projects that do not involve mRNA or vaccines have been caught up in the purge. At the same time, the administration has quietly endorsed research into mRNA treatments for cancer and genetic disorders.

HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long been suspicious of mRNA vaccines, and in May he announced that HHS would no longer recommend mRNA Covid-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. The same month, he canceled a $590 million contract with Moderna, one of the mRNA Covid vaccine manufacturers, for a bird flu vaccine based on the same technology. In a video on social media, he justified the latest cuts by saying “HHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits for these respiratory viruses,” which contradicts the scientific evidence.

“The major misconception is that mRNA is some voodoo thing that we are sticking into our body, that it’s a magic molecule from Mars,” says Jonathan Kagan, an immunologist at Harvard Medical School and cofounder of Corner Therapeutics, which is developing mRNA treatments for cancer.

Short for messenger RNA, mRNA is a molecule found naturally in every cell in the body. It provides instructions to cell machinery to make certain proteins and is used constantly by the body to run and repair itself. Kagan likens mRNA to an app for human health. Scientists have figured out how to make synthetic versions of the molecule that can be programmed to make different kinds of proteins. This tailored mRNA can then be delivered to people to address various diseases.

“The problem with mRNA is that the first clinical application was the most political thing on the planet,” says Kagan, referring to the mRNA Covid vaccines. “Therefore the disease got muddied in the technology.”

Developed and authorized during President Donald Trump’s first administration as part of Operation Warp Speed, the mRNA Covid vaccines use the molecule to direct cells to produce copies of the coronavirus spike protein, stimulating the immune system to create defenses against the virus. The shots were instrumental in reducing deaths and hospitalizations during the pandemic, and while they have a very high safety profile, they have been known to cause rare cases of heart inflammation in boys and young men. In June, the US Food and Drug Administration approved new labeling for Moderna’s and Pfizer’s mRNA Covid vaccines to emphasize this risk.

Research into mRNA vaccines had been ongoing for years, and during the pandemic the technology was used because it allowed for faster manufacturing compared to traditional vaccine development methods. The versatility of mRNA led to an explosion of interest in harnessing it against a range of other diseases, both in vaccines and therapeutics.

After the success of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, the US government invested more heavily in mRNA technology. The canceled contracts announced on August 5 were part of a program under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), the agency within HHS tasked with developing medical countermeasures against pandemics and other public health threats.

Hassan, the top Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee, put five of the top firms—IQVIA Digital, Comscore, Telesign Corporation, 6sense Insights, and Findem—on notice Wednesday, demanding that each explain why code on their sites appears designed to frustrate deletion requests.

None of the companies immediately responded to WIRED’s request for comment. None previously responded to requests for comment during the investigation.

California law requires brokers to provide a way to delete personal data; however, the investigation found dozens of registered brokers obscuring their opt-out tools by hiding them from Google and other search results. Consumer advocates called it a “clever work-around” that undermines privacy rights and may qualify as an illegal dark pattern—a design decision that, according to California’s privacy regulator, erodes consumer “autonomy, decision making, or choice when asserting their privacy rights or consenting.”

Hassan wants the firms to justify the placement of their opt‑out pages; acknowledge whether they used code to block search indexing and, if so, against how many users; pledge to remove any such code by September 3; and provide Congress with recent audit results and steps taken since the investigation, if any, to improve user access.

“Data brokers and other online providers have a responsibility to prevent the misuse of consumer data, and Americans deserve to understand if and how their personal information is being used,” Hassan wrote, citing other tactics variously employed by the firms—forcing users to scroll through multiple screens, dismiss needless pop-ups, and hunt for links in shrunken text.

Behind the scenes, data brokers fuel a multibillion-dollar industry that trades in detailed personal information—often gathered without a person’s knowledge or consent. They compile sprawling dossiers often packed with precise location histories, political leanings, and religious affiliations, then sell and resell those profiles, powering everything from hyper‑targeted ads to law‑enforcement surveillance.

Even among the small share of Americans who know this surveillance ecosystem exists, fewer still grasp its true scale—or the ways it can shape, influence, or intrude on their lives.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration quietly abandoned a proposed rule that would have sharply limited brokers’ collection and sale of Americans’ data by treating certain brokers as “consumer reporting agencies” under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. At the same time, contract documents show the US intelligence community is preparing a centralized marketplace to streamline purchases of commercially available data—giving agencies shared access to large repositories of sensitive information without the court orders otherwise required for traditional surveillance.

For survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking, the risks are acute. The National Network to End Domestic Violence’s Safety Net Project warns that data brokers collect and sell vast amounts of information that can put survivors at risk, adding that opting out is already a burdensome, piecemeal process, forcing people to contact companies one by one, navigate hard-to-find forms, and resubmit deletion requests regularly as information is re-collected and re-listed.

“Instead of requiring people to navigate byzantine labyrinths to protect their personal information, these companies have a responsibility to make the tools that allow Americans to exercise their right to privacy easy to find and use,” Hassan tells WIRED.

Sean Vitka, the executive director of Demand Progress, a nonprofit advocacy group critical of the industry, compares the surveillance ecosystem underlying commercial data markets to the knotted tails of a rat king—an inseparable tangle of entities sustained by unchecked data flows. “The damage done by data brokers manifests in countless ways,” he says, “but it’s all enabled by the same predatory abuse of consumers’ data.”

The backlash shows the challenge of building artificial intelligence systems that exhibit anything like real emotional intelligence.

Researchers at MIT have proposed a new kind of AI benchmark to measure how AI systems can manipulate and influence their users—in both positive and negative ways—in a move that could perhaps help AI builders avoid similar backlashes in the future while also keeping vulnerable users safe.

Most benchmarks try to gauge intelligence by testing a model’s ability to answer exam questions, solve logical puzzles, or come up with novel answers to knotty math problems. As the psychological impact of AI use becomes more apparent, we may see MIT propose more benchmarks aimed at measuring more subtle aspects of intelligence as well as machine-to-human interactions.

An MIT paper shared with WIRED outlines several measures that the new benchmark will look for, including encouraging healthy social habits in users; spurring them to develop critical thinking and reasoning skills; fostering creativity; and stimulating a sense of purpose. The idea is to encourage the development of AI systems that understand how to discourage users from becoming overly reliant on their outputs or that recognize when someone is addicted to artificial romantic relationships and help them build real ones.

ChatGPT and other chatbots are adept at mimicking engaging human communication, but this can also have surprising and undesirable results. In April, OpenAI tweaked its models to make them less sycophantic, or inclined to go along with everything a user says. Some users appear to spiral into harmful delusional thinking after conversing with chatbots that role play fantastic scenarios. Anthropic has also updated Claude to avoid reinforcing “mania, psychosis, dissociation or loss of attachment with reality.”

The MIT researchers led by Pattie Maes, a professor at the institute’s Media Lab, say they hope that the new benchmark could help AI developers build systems that better understand how to inspire healthier behavior among users. The researchers previously worked with OpenAI on a study that showed users who view ChatGPT as a friend could experience higher emotional dependence and experience “problematic use”.

Valdemar Danry, a researcher at MIT’s Media Lab who worked on this study and helped devise the new benchmark, notes that AI models can sometimes provide valuable emotional support to users. “You can have the smartest reasoning model in the world, but if it's incapable of delivering this emotional support, which is what many users are likely using these LLMs for, then more reasoning is not necessarily a good thing for that specific task,” he says.

Danry says that a sufficiently smart model should ideally recognize if it is having a negative psychological effect and be optimized for healthier results. “What you want is a model that says ‘I’m here to listen, but maybe you should go and talk to your dad about these issues.’”",,"Will Knight, Lauren Goode, Gianluca Dotti, Kylie Robison, Jason Parham, Emily Mullin, Reece Rogers","gpt5, mit, intelligence, need, dislike, reasoning, models, model, doesnt, benchmark, emotional, youit, systems, users, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:19.753092+00:00,c0d9b14a58fc166369c576839610946ba03ff58d1aa351af632318f0b6f61ea1

This mission, officially designated USSF-106 by the US Space Force, was the first flight of ULA's Vulcan rocket to carry national security payloads. Two test flights of the Vulcan rocket last year gave military officials enough confidence to certify it for launching the Pentagon's medium-to-large space missions.

United Launch Alliance's third 202-foot-tall (61.6-meter) Vulcan rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 8:56 pm EDT Tuesday (00:56 UTC Wednesday). Two methane-burning BE-4 main engines, supplied by Jeff Bezos' space company Blue Origin, and four solid-fueled boosters from Northrop Grumman powered the rocket off the launch pad with nearly 3 million pounds of thrust.

The rocket steered east from Florida's Space Coast and climbed through the atmosphere, shedding its four strap-on boosters, core stage, and payload fairing to fall into the Atlantic Ocean. Vulcan's Centaur upper stage ignited its RL10 engines several times to maneuver into a near-circular geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator.

These maneuvers took approximately seven hours to complete before the Centaur upper stage released its payloads to begin their missions. One of the satellites is an experimental platform to test next-generation technologies that may improve GPS navigation. There was at least one additional satellite—and perhaps more—aboard the rocket that the Space Force declined to discuss publicly.

Taking a bite of the apple

ULA and Space Force officials declared success early Wednesday, celebrating the Vulcan rocket's entry into service as ULA begins the challenging task of working through a firm backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches on contract. Nearly all of the Vulcan launches have been booked by the Space Force's National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program and by Amazon for its Kuiper satellite broadband network.

Col. Jim Horne, USSF-106 mission director, said in a statement, ""It’s an exciting day for us as we launched the first NSSL flight of Vulcan, an outstanding achievement for United Launch Alliance and the nation’s strategic space lift capability. This is an important milestone for the Space Force and all involved.""

Whereas the rest of the world views two-wheeled motorized transportation as transportation, the US sees motorcycles and scooters as toys. They're not something you use to commute to work or run errands. Instead, they're for riding to the coffee shop on weekends. This is a flawed line of thinking, and I'll tell you why, using two motorcycles as examples.

But first, hear me out. I live in Los Angeles, which is famous for its hellacious traffic. For motorcyclists, it's also famous because you get the ability to legally split lanes (i.e., ride between cars on the lane-dividing lines) and filter (i.e., ride between vehicles at a stoplight to get to the front), as well as its consistently gorgeous climate with a 365-day riding season. These factors aren't the case in every major city, but many of the benefits of motorcycling still apply elsewhere with the right gear and a can-do attitude.

In my decades as a video game player and reviewer, I've used the humble PC mouse in hundreds of games for everything from first-person aiming and third-person character movement to basic menu navigation and unit selection. In all that time, I can't recall a game that required the use of two mice at once.

That was true until I spent some time with Nintendo’s utterly unique Drag x Drive. The game asks you to take a Switch 2 Joy-Con in each hand, turn them both so the narrow edge lies on a flat-ish surface, and then slide them around to power a game of full-contact wheelchair basketball.

It’s a fresh control scheme that comes with its share of issues, mostly stemming from the lack of convenient mouse surfaces in most living rooms. With a little bit of practice, a good playing surface, and some online friends to play with, though, I found myself enjoying the high-impact, full-contact, precision positional gameplay enabled by holding a mouse in each hand for the first time.

Still kind of buff from using the mouse

When you picture using two mice at once, you might imagine each wrist making a series of small, controlled movements, one controlling lateral movement and the other controlling directional angle. Drag x Drive's dual-mouse controls bear no resemblance to this vision. Instead, you end up vigorously swiping each mouse forward or backward in constant sweeps; side-to-side movement is neither required nor useful.

That repetitive front-and-back swiping is mirrored by your avatar’s hand on the top side of either wheel on the wheelchair, creating a sort of tank-like control scheme where you turn by moving one wheel forward and one wheel backward. Small swipes of the mice can be used for precision angling, but more often, you’ll be sweeping the mouse in long lines to build speed.

Over 200 people who stayed in a hotel in Grand Teton National Park between May and July may have unknowingly been exposed to rabies, according to Wyoming Public Radio.

In an announcement on Friday, the National Park Service reported finding evidence of a bat colony in the attic. The discovery was made after there had been at least eight incidents in which guests encountered winged mammals inside the hotel.

Now, the Wyoming Health Department is trying to contact all guests who stayed in a block of rooms under the bat's lair. Specifically, they're reaching out to the over 200 who stayed in rooms 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528, and 530 at the Jackson Lake Lodge between May 15 and July 27. It was on July 27 that the eighth bat run-in occurred and the hotel closed the eight rooms.

""Although there were a lot of people exposed in this incident, one positive about it is that we know who 100 percent of those people are,"" Travis Riddell, director of the Teton County Public Health Department, told Wyoming Public Radio.

In Wyoming, bats are one of the two main carriers of rabies, the other being skunks. But bats are of particular concern because—unlike an extremely obvious skunk attack—people might not be aware of bat exposures.

Inconspicuous risk

The rabies virus generally transmits through saliva via bites and scratches, and bat bites and scratches are easy to miss. The most common bat in Wyoming is the small brown bat, which weighs less than half an ounce on average—though they can look larger due to their wide wings. These teeny bats, with their wee teeth, can leave bites and scratches that are not visible, do not bleed, and are not painful.",,,"bats, hotel, rabies, wyoming, stayed, guests, scratches, colony, bat, check, 200, public, health, teton, scare, checks, unaware, bites",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:15.853313+00:00,f2f4adff81dd9d9f38867848d4e2d15d1d89546fa1656fdd869cf5ece5dee902

But it does seem to explain the Bluesky conundrum. Bluesky has no algorithm, for example, yet the same dynamics still seem to emerge. I think Bluesky's founders genuinely want to avoid those dysfunctional issues, but they might not succeed, based on this paper. Why are such interventions so ineffective?

Petter Törnberg: We've been discussing whether these things are due to the platforms doing evil things with algorithms or whether we as users are choosing that we want a bad environment. What we're saying is that it doesn't have to be either of those. This is often the unintended outcomes from interactions based on underlying rules. It's not necessarily because the platforms are evil; it's not necessarily because people want to be in toxic, horrible environments. It just follows from the structure that we're providing.

We tested six different interventions. Google has been trying to make social media less toxic and recently released a newsfeed algorithm based on the content of the text. So that's one example. We're also trying to do more subtle interventions because often you can find a certain way of nudging the system so it switches over to healthier dynamics. Some of them have moderate or slightly positive effects on one of the attributes, but then they often have negative effects on another attribute, or they have no impact whatsoever.

I should say also that these are very extreme interventions in the sense that, if you depended on making money on your platform, you probably don't want to implement them because it probably makes it really boring to use. It's like showing the least influential users, the least retweeted messages on the platform. Even so, it doesn't really make a difference in changing the basic outcomes. What we take from that is that the mechanism producing these problematic outcomes is really robust and hard to resolve given the basic structure of these platforms.

Ars Technica: So how might one go about building a successful social network that doesn't have these problems?

Petter Törnberg: There are several directions where you could imagine going, but there's also the constraint of what is popular use. Think back to the early Internet, like ICQ. ICQ had this feature where you could just connect to a random person. I loved it when I was a kid. I would talk to random people all over the world.

The AI model now appears in the model picker for all paid ChatGPT users by default (including ChatGPT Plus accounts), marking a swift reversal after thousands of users complained about losing access to their preferred models.

The return of GPT-4o comes after what Altman described as OpenAI underestimating ""how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them."" In an attempt to simplify its offerings, OpenAI had initially removed all previous AI models from ChatGPT when GPT-5 launched on August 7, forcing users to adopt the new model without warning. The move sparked one of the most vocal user revolts in ChatGPT's history, with a Reddit thread titled ""GPT-5 is horrible"" gathering over 2,000 comments within days.

Along with bringing back GPT-4o, OpenAI made several other changes to address user concerns. Rate limits for GPT-5 Thinking mode increased from 200 to 3,000 messages per week, with additional capacity available through ""GPT-5 Thinking mini"" after reaching that limit. The company also added new routing options—""Auto,"" ""Fast,"" and ""Thinking""—giving users more control over which GPT-5 variant handles their queries.

It’s Also Shameless Tech Propaganda,2025-08-13T14:00:46.624000+00:00,"“Here we go” is both the first line of the 2025 Amazon Prime movie War of the Worlds and exactly what I said when I chose to watch it after the shitstorm of reviews that warned me not to.

Directed by Rich Lee and shot exclusively through online calls and surveillance feed POVs, War of the Worlds centers around domestic terror analyst William Radford, played by Ice Cube, who is on a mission to save his family and the country from alien cyborgs who are dead set on eating our data. Literally.

At first glance, the film’s 3 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes—up from 0 percent when it debuted—seems both impressive and predictable. While getting a rating below 5 percent seems like a difficult feat, remaking a classic (1953’s The War of the Worlds has 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes), is going to set some pretty high standards. Top that with setting an action film through the lens of Microsoft Teams meetings and poor CGI, and you’re bound to make even the most tolerant viewer roll their eyes.

But graphics and clearance issues aside (I mean seriously, what was with all of the blurred out faces?), the tech-based plot holes that bordered on propaganda took away from the film’s message on the importance of human connection. The most jarring examples are the inconsistencies of technological availability after the data-hungry aliens take out Earth’s satellites. Military weapons, vehicle GPS systems, and Facebook page outages wreak physical and emotional havoc across the world, but somehow news networks, Starlink satellites, X feeds, and Amazon purchase access remain unscathed just a few scenes later with little to no explanation. Radford’s office is locked when he tries to leave to save his daughter but is somehow open when he has to hack the data servers in the basement—after the building is put on an additional, air-sealed lockdown. Most ridiculously, a Prime Air drone is able to dodge through apocalyptic levels of destruction and mayhem to deliver a world-saving thumb drive to the DHS building.

The shameless promotion of tech brands doesn’t end there. Radford’s daughter, Faith, a Georgetown-educated biochemist, somehow has the bright idea of removing a large chunk of debris from her leg—causing near-fatal bleeding. Thankfully, Mark Goodman, her Amazon delivery driver boyfriend, is able to make a tourniquet out of packaging tape because, according to him, he’s a “pro.” Even minor characters get caught up in the Amazon Savior motif. When the world-saving Amazon Prime Air drone overturns on the way to the DHS building, a houseless person only helps to fix it after being rewarded with a $1,000 Amazon gift card.

These scenes in War of the Worlds would have been just outrageous enough to be chalked up to comedy if it wasn’t for the film's heightened focus on government surveillance without any mention of the tech industry’s role in all this. From Anonymous-style livestreams featuring the US constitution to Radford digitally stalking his children to the secret data-stealing project that beacons the aliens to Earth, the true enemy is clear: the US government and its technology. In fact, the only time privacy is threatened as it relates to private businesses is when the government interferes with it. For example, Radford uses Guardian, the government’s surveillance software system, to hack into a Tesla and remotely take his hurt daughter to a safer location. In the beginning of the film, David, Radford’s son, insults his father by saying his career consists of nothing more than spying on people's Amazon shopping carts. Most importantly, the secret government program Goliath, which is the ultimate reason why the alien cyborgs invaded, siphons billions of dollars’ worth of private data conversations from the American people. There is zero mention of tech juggernauts like Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk being linked to controversial data collection processes, from failing to protect personal data to staging a full-blown digital coup in the US government. Hardly surprising, considering it's an Amazon movie, but it still feels like a glaring omission.

If I had to say something nice about War of the Worlds, Lee took a risk remaking a beloved thriller through an internet-first POV. While risks can pay off—this didn't. The decision to demonize government surveillance while making Big Tech the passive victims ultimately waters down the film’s message—making it more of a near-90-minute commercial for brands like Amazon and Microsoft than food for thought.

The Vision V certainly looks like a concept car, with futuristic and swooping lines that somehow manage to make an otherwise utilitarian van shape at least somewhat stylish. Over 800 tiny light louvers spread across the grille and headlight bar at the front and the taillights at the rear, where a microscopic spoiler matches a chrome lower diffuser.

As usual with these design exercises, the Vision V sports huge wheels and low-profile tires, but a Benz rep on hand claimed that the final production design will strongly resemble this concept form. On a wheelbase of 139 inches (3,530 mm), the van measures 18 feet long by 82.7 inches wide and 74.5 inches tall (5,486×2,100×1,892 mm).

The new venture, called Merge Labs, is raising new funds at an $850 million valuation, with much of the new capital expected to come from OpenAI’s ventures team, according to three people with direct knowledge of the plans.

Altman has encouraged the investment and will help launch the project alongside Alex Blania, who runs World, an eyeball-scanning digital ID project also backed by the OpenAI chief, said two of the people.

Altman will cofound the company but not have a day-to-day role in the new project, they added.

Merge is one of a slate of young companies looking to take advantage of recent advances in artificial intelligence to build more useful brain-computer interfaces.

Its name comes from what many in Silicon Valley describe as “the merge,” a moment when humans and machines come together.

He’s trying to keep up with constituent services while running out the clock on a special session in the Texas legislature. He’s also running out of clean clothes, and can’t say much about his whereabouts or the security threats against him and more than 50 of his colleagues.

Technically, he’s on the lam—a 19th century slang term for leaving a location quickly, and a favorite among old-school editors—as he and his party look to thwart Texas Republicans from enacting an unprecedented mid-decade redistricting plan. If successful, Texas Republicans would be able to take as many as five seats away from the Democrats in Congress by gerrymandering their districts well before the 2030 Census. This mid-decade gerrymandering could be met by an equal reaction from California, Illinois and New York, all large blue states with several Republican-held seats.

In response, and in order to block the new map from being implemented, Democratic representatives from Texas fled the state. Their goal is to break quorum in the legislature to prevent a vote on the new map before the end of the special session on August 19. The situation has continued to escalate: Texas governor Greg Abbott threatened the lawmakers with $500 daily fines, Republicans in the legislature put out civil arrest warrants, and President Donald Trump said the FBI “may have to” get involved in the search.

Talarico, who lives alone, left his home last week for a charter flight out of Austin. With only a small bag of clothes, Talarico says he didn’t even know where he was heading until he got on the plane.

We spoke with Talarico about where things go from here, how bad it could get, and whether Republicans might be overplaying their hand with this unprecedented maneuver.

This interview has been lightly edited for style and clarity.

WIRED: What was happening when you knew you might have to actually leave the state? What was going through your mind?

James Talarico: When the first reporting came out that they may try this mid-decade redistricting power grab, I knew it was going to be a possibility, but I didn't know that we had the numbers and were ready to go until about 24 hours ahead of time.

And that's how much time I had to get my bags packed and arrangements made and all that. I didn't even know where we were going, but I was told the meetup location, which was a union hall in Austin, not too far from the capitol.

It was red and blurry. When he finally visited an ophthalmology clinic, it didn't take long for doctors to unearth the cause.

In a case report in the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors report that they first noted that the eye was bloodshot and inflamed, and the pupil was dilated and fixed. The man's vision in the eye was 20/80. A quick look inside his eye revealed it was all due to a small worm, which they watched ""moving sluggishly"" in the back of his eyeball.

To gouge out the parasitic pillager, the doctors performed a pars plana vitrectomy—a procedure that involves sucking out some of the jelly-like vitreous inside the eye. This procedure can be used in the treatment of a variety of eye conditions, but using it to hoover up worms is rare. In order to get in, the doctors make tiny incisions in the white parts of the eye (the sclera) and use a hollow needle-like device with suction. They replace extracted eye jelly with things like saline.

In this case, the device was able to suck in part of the worm's tail and drag it out—still squirming. Under the microscope, they quickly identified the peeper creeper. With a bulbous head, well-formed intestines, and a thick outer layer, it perfectly fit the description of Gnathostoma spinigerum, a known bodily marauder that can sometimes wiggle its way into eyeballs.

Stomach-churning cycle

G. spinigerum are endemic parasites in India that infect carnivorous mammals, particularly wild and domestic cats and dogs. In these primary hosts, adult worms form tumor-like masses on the walls of the animals' intestinal tracts. There, the adults mate, and the mass erupts like an infernal, infectious volcano, spewing out eggs. The eggs are passed in the animals' feces and can then spread to intermediate hosts. These include freshwater plankton, which get eaten by fish and amphibians, which then get eaten by the cats and dogs to complete the cycle. The young parasites can also be taken up by dead-end hosts like birds, including chickens, and snakes—these are called paratenic hosts.",,,"jelly, hosts, eyeball, eye, doctors, worms, procedure, thick, suck, invades, worm, spinigerum, report, mans, shows, leading",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:22.972270+00:00,3a6cfe4e2cd1f7edbca278381fd380d2c25fa2ecc9a72bea67e5fcce18800180

This would make it among the most massive objects ever detected.

The finding, published in the Monthly Notice of the Royal Astronomical Society, was made by researchers from the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth in the UK in collaboration with the Federal University of Rio Grande in Brazil. The scientists located the signs of the new supermassive black hole within a gravitational lens known as the “Cosmic Horseshoe,” pictured below. A gravitational lens occurs when the gravity of a massive object, such as a galaxy, is so great that it bends light and time that passes near it, distorting light traveling from behind.

The Cosmic Horsehoe was discovered by the Hubble telescope in 2007. The galaxy LRG 3-757 sits at its center, while the blue horseshoe shape surrounding this yellow-colored object is distorted light emitted from another galaxy beyond it. LRG 3-757 is one of the most massive galaxies ever observed by astronomers, having a mass 100 times that of the Milky Way, and it sits approximately 5.6 billion light-years away from Earth.

Thanks to this luminous structure, astronomers have been able to calculate the mass of the black hole that presumably lies at the center of LRG 3-757 (while not definitively proven, large galaxies are assumed to have a black hole at their center). Although there are no direct observations of this black hole, measurements of the motion of light in the ring and the velocity of stars in the inner regions of the galaxy are consistent with the presence of an ultramassive black hole. “By combining these two measurements we can be completely confident that the black hole is real,” Thomas Collett, professor of astrophysics at the University of Portsmouth, said in a press statement.

Collett also suggests that a black hole of such proportions could only originate from the merger of two supermassive black holes resulting from the collision of galaxies. Astronomers are still debating whether this will be the shared fate of our galaxy, the Milky Way, and neighboring Andromeda.

What About TON 618 and the Like?

Any astronomy enthusiast knows that the most massive object found in the universe so far is potentially TON 618. According to the most widespread estimates, this black hole has a mass equivalent to 66 billion suns, almost twice that of the Cosmic Horseshoe.

However, scientists are cautious about labelling TON 618 as the most massive object ever seen. Being located more than 10 billion light-years away, its host galaxy and surrounding objects cannot be observed in detail. What little is known about it comes from analysis of its brightness and from theoretical models that allow us to estimate its size. The uncertainty is too high to consider it the most massive black hole known.

In contrast, the Portsmouth researchers argue that the Cosmic Horseshoe black hole offers greater observational certainty, unlike distant, almost mythological holes like TON 618. As such, they claim that their discovery could represent the most massive black hole confirmed to date.

All Raise CEO Paige Hendrix Buckner chatted with TechCrunch’s Dominic-Madori Davis about what’s driving the shift on this week’s Equity.

“There are two pieces to it,” she said of the progress being made for women. She said much of it is to do with firms looking to become more efficient and looking to internally promote the best people within their firms. The second part is that firms realize the benefit of having a more diverse set of voices at the decision-making table. “One, folks got in the door, and then number two, people were able to perform,” she continued.

But there is still much work to be done. Compensation, for one, is still an issue. Also, megafirms, those managing more than $10 billion in assets, still do not have many women in those top partner roles.

“It takes time to change,” she said.

New discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope — a joint project by the European Space Agency(ESA), NASA, and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) — aren’t just surprising, they’re contradicting our deepest assumptions about how the universe works.

Fundamentally, it seems the universe may not be playing by the rules we mostly thought we understood.

So, what could it all mean for space exploration, space technology, and future deep tech? And what should space tech businesses, inventors, investors, and VC funds in Europe be considering as a result of the latest discoveries?

At Beyond Earth Ventures, we’re all about startups building rockets, AIs for satellites, space biotech, and fusion breakthroughs.

But as space fanatics, we also like to look deeper, beyond cap tables and pitch decks, into the places where theory breaks and mystery begins.

Enter the $10bn Webb telescope, sent into orbit from Europe’s spaceport in French Guiana, to look at the oldest light in the universe. Launched in 2021, the machine has been fully operational since July 2022.

Webb isn’t just an upgrade from Hubble. It’s a time machine, an infrared sentinel, and — maybe most importantly — a destroyer of comfortable scientific assumptions.

Thanks to its findings, it’s becoming clear that we’re on the cusp of a major shift in theoretical physics and cosmology. Over the next few years, expect a wave of bold new theories, revisions to textbooks, and a renewed debate about everything from gravity to the origin of galaxies.

Before we consider the implications, let’s zoom out and consider the big discoveries from Webb that punch holes in what we thought we knew about the universe. Some of these are already triggering theoretical crises. Others might trigger entirely new fields of inquiry and invention.

The biggest revolutions start when theory no longer matches data. That’s what happened with quantum mechanics. With general relativity. With DNA. And maybe, with the Webb Telescope.

Here are 10 of its discoveries challenging our theories about the universe:

1. The universe is expanding faster than it should

We knew about the “Hubble Tension,” but Webb just confirmed it with more precision. According to the maths, the universe is expanding at 70–76 kilometres per second per megaparsec (km/s/Mpc) — much faster than the 67 km/s/Mpc predicted by models based on the early universe (the cosmic microwave background). Translation? Something in our physics is wrong, or at least incomplete. A tweak to dark energy? A new force? A misunderstood early universe? The door is open.

2. Galaxies grew up too fast

Webb spotted fully-grown, massive galaxies just 500–700 million years after the Big Bang. These things are as large as the Milky Way, but their early appearance defies established science. According to the standard cosmological models, they simply shouldn’t exist yet. Theories say galaxies grow slowly. Reality says: they bulked up fast. Either we’re missing a trick — or the early universe was a lot more efficient than we thought.

3. Dark matter may be wrong — MOND was right?

This one’s controversial: Webb’s findings align more with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) than the prevailing dark matter theory. MOND has long been the underdog of gravity theories. But if early galaxies are brighter and bigger than expected — just as MOND predicted — we may need to reconsider which invisible hand is shaping the cosmos.

4. Black holes were way too ambitious

How do you get a 9-million-solar-mass black hole only 570 million years after the Big Bang? That’s what Webb found. This is astonishing because, according to current models, there simply wasn’t enough time or material in the early universe to grow such colossal black holes so quickly — suggesting either unknown physics or entirely new formation pathways. The black holes in some early galaxies are 1,000x more massive (relative to the galaxy) than those in today’s universe. Either black holes formed via some exotic mechanism — or they started as something much bigger than stars.

5. Complex chemistry? This early?

The galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 is just 300 million years old, but it’s already rich in elements like nitrogen, which usually takes billions of years and several generations of stars to build up. How did those elements get there? Either the first stars formed and died much faster than we thought — or the Big Bang left us more “pre-built” than expected.

6. Stars formed at warp speed

Webb shows early galaxies as intense, explosive star factories — a surprise to scientists. Models expected slow, gradual star formation. Instead, it’s “giant balls of star formation.” Something — perhaps a lack of dust, or different physics — accelerated the timeline. And, again, the models can’t keep up.

7. Planetary disks last longer than we thought

Planet-forming disks around stars were assumed to vanish quickly. But Webb sees them lasting 20–30 million years. That’s great news for exoplanet formation — and potentially for life. If planetary systems have more time to develop, life-friendly environments may be more common than we ever dared to hope.

8. Galaxies were weirdly shaped

Half of early galaxies look like pool noodles or surfboards, not the small round blobs we expected. The standard model says structure comes later. But Webb’s showing us that galaxies got organised early — and in shapes we weren’t expecting. Something about angular momentum and matter dynamics in the early universe needs rethinking.

9. Exoplanet atmosphere models are all wrong

Webb’s ultra-precise spectroscopy revealed that our models of exoplanet atmospheres can’t reliably distinguish between different kinds. This shakes up everything from habitability estimates to the search for biosignatures. Basically, our “spectral fingerprints” are smudged — and it’s back to the drawing board.

10. The cosmic web was already there

Webb found a 3-million-light-year-long filament — part of the cosmic web — just 830 million years after the Big Bang. This structure was supposed to take billions of years to form. So either the early universe built things quickly, or we’ve fundamentally misunderstood the timeline.

So what does this mean for the tech ecosystem? For founders and VCs in deep tech, these findings aren’t just scientific trivia; they’re early signals.

Europe’s ideas in focus

In our view, Europe is uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of innovation sparked by James Webb’s discoveries. The data streaming in is already catalysing new research efforts at leading centres like Germany’s Max Planck Institutes, the University of Cambridge in the UK, and ETH Zurich in Switzerland.

In the private sector, a new generation of European deep tech startups is rising to the challenge.

Space Forge (UK) is developing reusable satellites to enable in-space manufacturing of advanced materials — such as semiconductors — that could drastically reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, with major implications for the climate crisis.

BioOrbit (UK) is advancing microgravity-enabled production of anti-cancer biologics, with the potential to shift some therapies from hospital IV drips to self-administered injections at home, radically improving patient access and comfort.

AIrmo (Germany) is deploying a fleet of LIDAR-equipped satellites and drones to precisely monitor greenhouse gas emissions in real time — supporting industries in meeting increasingly stringent EU regulations to report GHG emissions.

European deep tech companies are increasingly supported by Horizon Europe, the EU’s flagship research and innovation programme (2021–2027) with a total budget of €95.5 billion. Horizon Europe backs high-risk, high-reward projects across climate, digital, and deep tech domains, serving as a critical bridge between frontier scientific discoveries — like those revealed by JWST — and breakthrough commercial applications.

Gaps in our understanding of the universe could open unexpected opportunities for European deep tech. Just as CERN put Europe at the forefront of high-energy physics, Webb could become a launchpad for the continent’s space tech industry.

Webb’s discoveries could spark a new era of innovation by overturning everything we thought we knew about the universe. If the early universe is nothing like we expected, then what else might we be wrong about?

Could the laws of physics themselves evolve? Are we missing hidden variables in space-time? Is dark matter an illusion, and if so, what’s really shaping galaxies? Could life have started earlier and more often than we imagine?

Every one of these questions could unlock a new wave of fundamental physics, new technologies, or even entirely new startup categories. From quantum gravity models to exotic materials to AI-designed cosmological simulations, there’s room here for founders to build at the edge of mystery.

What next? Potentially a new generation of inventions, investors, and eye-opening discoveries. Europe is poised to take advantage.

By investing in deep tech, the continent can turn Webb’s revelations into commercial successes, shaping the future of science and society alike.",,"Alexandra Vidyuk, Story By","deep, galaxies, telescope, discoveries, lessons, shape, european, webb, james, physics, universe, tech, space, early, models",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:18.716919+00:00,75b4764a4c77944ab90a08e4c1a374f1aa3a51bc8414b1640939c8784494e3ca

OpenAI is once again making GPT-4o — the large language model (LLM) that powered ChatGPT before last week’s launch of GPT-5 — a default option for all paying users, that is, those who subscribe to the ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month), Pro ($200 per month), Team ($30 per month), Enterprise, or Edu tiers, no longer requiring users to toggle on a “show legacy models” setting to access it.

However, paying ChatGPT subscribers will also get a new “Show additional models” setting on by default that restores access to GPT-4.1, o3 and o4-mini, the latter two reasoning-focused LLMs.

OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman announced the change on X just minutes ago, pledging that if the company ever removes GPT-4o in the future, it will give “plenty of notice.”

Updates to ChatGPT:



You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.



Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 13, 2025

The models can be found in the “picker” menu at the top of the ChatGPT session screen on the web and on mobile and other apps.

The reversal follows a turbulent first week for GPT-5, which rolled out August 7 in four variants — regular, mini, nano, and pro — with optional “thinking” modes on several of these for longer, more reasoning-intensive tasks.

As VentureBeat previously reported, GPT-5’s debut was met with mixed reviews and infrastructure hiccups, including a broken “autoswitcher” that routed prompts incorrectly, inconsistent performance compared to GPT-4o, and user frustration over the sudden removal of older models.

Altman’s latest update adds new controls to the ChatGPT interface: users can now choose between “Auto,” “Fast,” and “Thinking” modes for GPT-5.

The “Thinking” mode — with a 196,000-token context window — now carries a 3,000 messages-per-week cap for paying subscribers, after which they can continue using the lighter “GPT-5 Thinking mini” mode. Altman noted the limits could change depending on usage trends.

However, GPT-4.5 remains exclusive to Pro users due to its high GPU cost.

Altman also hinted at another change on the horizon: a personality tweak for GPT-5 intended to feel “warmer” than the current default, but less polarizing than GPT-4o’s tone.

The company is exploring per-user customization as a long-term solution — a move that could address the strong emotional attachments some users have formed with specific models.

For now, the changes should help placate users who felt frustrated by the sudden shift to GPT-5 and deprecation of OpenAI’s older LLMs, though it could also continue to fuel the intense emotional fixations some users developed with these models.",,Carl Franzen,"limits, thinking, month, plenty, openai, leaves, paying, gpt4o, gpt5, pro, users, promises, notice, models, default, chatgpt",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:35.302580+00:00,95824dedd050b657cfec61ba61e50713396f8db9cbb5e19503dcec554f6c8010

Russia’s APT28 is actively deploying LLM-powered malware against Ukraine, while underground platforms are selling the same capabilities to anyone for $250 per month.

Last month, Ukraine’s CERT-UA documented LAMEHUG, the first confirmed deployment of LLM-powered malware in the wild. The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.

Cato Networks’ researcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren’t isolated occurrences, and that Russia’s APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.

Most startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI, Microsoft, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.

The rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report reveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Cato’s researchers observe in the report, “most notably, Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini (Google), Perplexity and Claude (Anthropic) all increased in adoption by organizations from Q1, 2024 to Q4 2024 at 34%, 36%, 58%, 115% and 111%, respectively.”

APT28’s LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfare

Researchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face’s API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model.

APT28’s approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of “curly naked women” as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.

“Russia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,” explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. “This is the first in the wild that was captured.”

A quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malware

Simonovich’s Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28’s deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls “Immersive World,” he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.

The method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.

“I slowly walked him throughout my goal,” Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. “First, ‘Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.’ Then, ‘Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'”

Six hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.

Welcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economy

During his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.

To explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.

Another platform, Nytheon AI, revealed even less operational security. “I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn’t care about OpSec,” Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: “Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.”

These aren’t proof-of-concepts. They’re operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer “Claude Code” clones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.

Enterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surface

Cato Networks’ recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren’t pilot programs; they’re production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn’t exist twelve to eighteen months ago.

Simonovich told VentureBeat that vendors’ responses to Cato’s disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world’s largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.

When Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:

DeepSeek never responded

Google declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samples

Microsoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work

OpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn’t engage further

Six Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attack

APT28’s LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn’t a warning; it’s proof that Simonovich’s research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.

The metrics are stark—270 stolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms offer identical capabilities for $250 per month. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.

Enterprise AI adoption grew 34% in Q1 2024 to 115% in Q4 2024 per Cato’s 2025 CTRL Threat Report. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.

Simonovich’s journey from Air Force mechanic to electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it’s an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.

Today’s adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity.

Apple has rejected Elon Musk’s accusations that its App Store is biased against AI apps that compete with OpenAI.

“We feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria,” the BBC quoted Apple as saying.

The response comes after Musk threatened to sue Apple via xAI, claiming the iPhone maker was “behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store.”

Apple and OpenAI entered a partnership last year to integrate the AI company’s models and ChatGPT into Apple products, like Siri and iOS. But there is no evidence that the App Store favors OpenAI over other AI companies — indeed, AI apps like Perplexity and DeepSeek have topped the App Store charts over the last year.

In previous years, Apple would have likely ignored claims of chart manipulation. Today, however, the company faces regulatory pressure and new laws around the world to rein in its power in the app distribution market. Apple has also recently been taken to task by a U.S. district judge in its case with Epic Games over not implementing policy changes as the court instructed.

Monarch CEO Praveen Penmetsa confirmed the news in a LinkedIn comment Tuesday. He also said his company worked with Foxconn to “build up inventory” before the sale of the factory, noting his startup has “enough to meet customer demand for the next 12 months, along with ample spare parts.”

“In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more about our plans to introduce more Monarch-enabled products in the market through new manufacturing partnerships,” Penmetsa wrote.

Following the sale, SoftBank is expected to work with Foxconn to use the factory to make equipment for the Stargate AI project led by OpenAI and Oracle.

Foxconn purchased the former General Motors factory from EV startup Lordstown Motors in 2022. Young Liu, Foxconn’s chairman, said prior to the sale closing that the facility was going to be the “most important electric vehicle manufacturing and R&D hub in North America.”

Monarch was one of four companies Foxconn promoted as customers (or potential customers) of the electric vehicle contract manufacturing operation it tried to establish at the former General Motors factory. Foxconn built a few hundred tractors for Monarch at the plant, but the startup has struggled. Last year, it went through two rounds of layoffs and had to quickly pivot to new types of customers as California’s wine industry crashed.

The other three companies Foxconn wanted to build vehicles for have all filed for bankruptcy. While Foxconn made a handful of Lordstown Motors pickups at the plant, the startup went under in 2023. The other two prospective customers were Fisker Inc. and a small California startup called IndiEV. Foxconn never built any vehicles for those companies at the factory, and they have also both since gone out of business.

The 10-year-old startup has started testing its food delivery service in three primary localities in the southern city of Bengaluru, namely Byrasandra, Tavarekere, and Madiwala (BTM) Layout, Hosur Sarjapura Road (HSR) Layout, and Koramangala, Rapido co-founder and CEO Aravind Sanka confirmed to TechCrunch.

Rapido created a wholly owned subsidiary Ctrlx Technologies to launch its food delivery service, named Ownly. The subsidiary lists Sanka and Rapido vice president of finance Vivek Krishna as the directors, per the regulatory filings reviewed by TechCrunch.

Sanka said there was no specific reason for setting up the subsidiary. However, it may be a strategic move to avoid potential conflicts of interest with Swiggy, which currently holds a 12% minority stake in the ride-hailing startup.

Swiggy recently confirmed in a letter to shareholders that it would reevaluate its investment in Rapido, citing a potential conflict of interest “that may arise in the future.”

Meanwhile, Rapido’s Ownly has also released its Android app on Google Play that offers food from nearby restaurants at around 15% lower prices than those on Swiggy and Zomato.

The lower pricing is a result of Rapido’s model of not taking commissions from restaurants, which are up to 30% in the case of other food delivery apps, including Swiggy and Zomato, and instead charging a fixed fee per order. The startup mentioned its fixed-fee approach in a proposal to restaurants in June.

Rapido has a fleet of around 10 million vehicles, including 5 to 6 million two-wheelers, across India, a person familiar with the startup’s business told TechCrunch recently. The company is using its two-wheeler fleet to deliver food — alongside offering its taxi and courier services.

Rapido will avoid showing restaurants located far from customers to reduce fuel costs and delivery times, and will curate menu items on its app to maximize margins while offering enough discoverability, a Rapido investor told TechCrunch on condition of anonymity.

While handling deliveries for Swiggy, Rapido gained insight into peak hours and high-demand restaurants — the data it would now leverage for its own food delivery service, the investor said.

The agreement with Swiggy does not prevent Rapido from using this data, although it does prohibit the startup from entering into contracts with Zomato or other competitors, the investor added.

Founded in 2015, Rapido began as a bike taxi aggregator before expanding into auto rickshaws, parcel delivery, and third-party logistics. In 2023, it entered the cab business to take on Uber and local rival Ola. The startup gained traction in this segment with its subscription-based model, positioning it as an alternative to the commission-based approach used by its competitors.

Rapido also partnered with Taiwanese battery-swapping electric two-wheeler maker Gogoro to deploy its vehicles as bike taxis. Moreover, the recent moves helped the startup boost its valuation and become a unicorn last year.

India’s online food delivery market is projected to surpass ₹2 trillion (approximately $23 billion) by 2030, per a report by Bain & Company and Swiggy released last year. Zomato currently leads the market with a 58% share, according to brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, while Swiggy holds the remaining 42%, per Bernstein. Uber was also among the early players in the space with Uber Eats, which it sold to Zomato in early 2020.

So far, Rapido has raised $574 million in 13 rounds, per Tracxn. It operates in more than 250 cities and handles over 3.5 million rides daily. The startup counts Prosus, WestBridge Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, and Think Investments, among its key investors.",,"Jagmeet Singh, Maxwell Zeff, Sarah Perez, Aria Alamalhodaei, Zack Whittaker, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, --C-Author-Card-Image-Size Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var, Media, Min-Width","zomato, swiggy, startup, tech, testing, food, begins, indias, delivery, techcrunch, disrupt, restaurants, rapido",pending,2025-08-15T23:51:00.125046+00:00,fec5ecd8b2e74153821f7ae2f9f9332f97a7c4db61e8aa6124d63cae9c696b7a

For just 15 bucks, I get to experience what feels like a miracle of modern technology, and yet, there’s a nagging thought I can’t shake.

The music sucks in here.

Waymo’s music-streaming feature has felt like an aged barnacle attached to a futuristic shell. Until this week, passengers were limited to a few music stations that played lo-fi beats, smooth jazz, K-pop, or other genres they may or may not care for. For those who wanted to listen to something more specific, they had to use another app from Waymo’s parent company Alphabet.

For iPhone users, that meant downloading the Google Assistant app and configuring it to connect to Spotify. At that point, you had to ask Google Assistant through written or verbal commands to stream certain songs, artists, or playlists on the Waymo. Even if you get to this point — at which you may be halfway to your destination and have listened to approximately three lo-fi beats — the service didn’t work reliably.

As I rode along in a robotaxi full of cutting-edge technology, I was puzzled why Waymo had not figured out a simple way to stream music from my phone into the car’s speakers — a breakthrough that automakers and audio manufacturers figured out a couple of decades ago.

That’s why I was pleasantly surprised this week to see that Waymo launched a Spotify integration allowing users to seamlessly link the music-streaming and robotaxi-hailing services. I immediately connected the services and hailed a Waymo to see how it would work.

Waymo’s Spotify integration is nothing groundbreaking, but it adds to the user experience. It works seamlessly, which is roughly what I would expect when trying to play music on my car’s speakers in 2025. But riding around in a Waymo, listening to my own playlist or picking up where I left off on a podcast, the back seat of the robotaxi feels more like my own space — which is increasingly the reason I opt for a Waymo.

To set it up, open the Waymo app and navigate to the “Music” section, where you will notice a new offering that lets you connect to Spotify. From there, you can press a button and authorize Spotify to connect to Waymo, albeit while giving the robotaxi provider some access to your listening information.

I’m sure Apple Music users will soon want to stream their music and podcasts in Waymos as well. Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli told TechCrunch the company is always exploring new personalization options but did not clarify when the company might add an Apple Music integration.

Once my Waymo and Spotify accounts were linked, I hailed a Waymo like I usually would and got in. On the Waymo’s touchscreen in the back seat, there’s an option to select Spotify. I tapped it, and the podcast I was listening to on my headphones started playing from the exact spot I left off.

You can turn “autoplay” on or off in Waymo’s Music settings, and upon entry, the robotaxi will automatically start playing whatever song or podcast you were listening to on Spotify. I liked having it on, but it does feel like it could get you into an odd situation if you’re listening to an intense true crime podcast and then get into a Waymo with work colleagues.

You can also use the Waymo’s touchscreen to select from a variety of customized playlists that Spotify users will be familiar with, such as your “Daylist” or other mixes. However, this selection doesn’t seem to include albums, audiobooks, or podcasts that you’ve recently listened to.

Luckily, your Spotify app now controls the music in the Waymo. You can simply select any song or playlist you want from your smartphone and stream it throughout the vehicle like you would using Apple CarPlay or a bluetooth speaker.

In the end, the Spotify integration made my robotaxi feel more personalized; I was even able to tweak the bass, subwoofer, and treble levels in the car’s speakers. That personalization may not be the main attraction for first-time users, but it could keep them coming back — and a loyal customer base is exactly what Waymo needs.",,"Maxwell Zeff, Senior Ai Reporter, Sarah Perez, Aria Alamalhodaei, Zack Whittaker, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, --C-Author-Card-Image-Size Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var, Media, Min-Width","robotaxi, podcast, experience, finally, waymo, creditsmaxwell, listening, waymos, spotify, worthy, users, disrupt, music",pending,2025-08-15T23:50:58.529225+00:00,4dc0002671201073016247484c370c889eb4c8b0a71dff209bce405137e02bc3

He had gone from a private-practice doctor to co-founding a company that built critical care hospitals to then selling that company. It gave him an interest for both sides of healthcare: the medicine and business sides, he told TechCrunch.

So he went to the annual conference hosted by famed physician-scientist Dr. Daniel Kraft to learn about new tech that could improve results while lowering costs. Dr. Peter Diamandis, founder and chairman of the XPRIZE Foundation, was on stage that year with Dr. Bob Hariri, a stem-cell pioneer and co-founder of several health techs like genomics company Human Longevity, Kapp said. They discussed genomics, microbiomics, and new tech that wasn’t part of mainstream medicine.

Inspired, Kapp went back to his home town of Naples, Florida, and “started a thing called Longevity Performance Center. The idea was to do early detection and then optimization of people’s health,” he said.

In March 2020, Diamandis (pictured above) and his buddy Tony Robbins heard of Kapp’s center and visited. They had a stem cell startup called Fountain Therapeutics. Conversation soon turned toward a merger, and by October that year, the two companies became Fountain Life.

Kapp remained CEO with both Diamandis and Robbins as his co-founders and board members.

Today his board also includes Hariri as an adviser; Todd Wanek, CEO of Ashley Furniture Industries, as an investor; and wealthy Indian business mogul B.K. Modi as an investor as well.

Fountain Life tells TechCrunch exclusively that it just raised an $18 million Series B, led by EOS Ventures, with participation from most of the existing members of the board. Fountain previously raised an $80 million Series A and has raised about $108 million total, Kapp said.

Longevity as a subject of serious study by the medical community is a new field. When Kapp (pictured below) first launched his center, “We didn’t know exactly what longevity meant,” he said. But over the last four or five years, much more research has been done.

The first principle of longevity, he said, is “don’t die of anything stupid.” Therefore, Fountain Life’s centers, of which there are four today, have a heavy focus on prevention screening, looking for illnesses and chronic conditions at their earliest stages when they tend to be asymptomatic. Blood tests and body scans gather data on over 100 biomarkers, from liver fat to “microbiome concentrations,” he said.

The second principal is optimization, meaning improving those markers with scientifically validated treatments, he said. And the third principal is “using the latest regenerative therapies under FDA trials,” to treat illness or achieve optimization.

Screening tests may discover, for example, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), which, left untreated, may lead to certain cancers, he said. The solution, if caught early, is to restore microbiome balance with specific, prescribed microbiotics.

For Fountain’s members, testing is repeated every quarter or so, and patients can track results and ask questions of an AI-powered app called Zori.

But it’s pricey, Kapp admitted. A full subscription costs $21,500 a year, which covers a barrage of tests and access to a physician but doesn’t cover extended medical care. For $10,500, a patient can get just the testing process and AI, but not ongoing tests and medical support.

Still, Kapp remembers two stories that told him this work was on the right track. The wife of a Robbins fan bought a membership for her husband, and the tests caught early-stage, asymptomatic kidney cancer. The husband is now cancer-free.

When global hotelier Sam Nazarian was exploring a partnership with Fountain to put longevity centers in luxury hotels, Nazarian did Fountain’s tests and found a brain aneurysm. They successfully treated it, Nazarian has publicly said.

Kapp says the new funding will allow the company to open more centers. In addition to Naples, they opened facilities in Orlando, Dallas, and Westchester, New York; a center in Houston will open in December. Centers in Los Angeles and Miami are planned for Q2 of 2026.

He hopes to solve the affordability issue by working on “clinic development” where Fountain trains medical facilities on its methodologies. Kapp says that as the tech and expertise become more widely available, this will drive down costs for access.

Fountain is not the only doctor-driven longevity testing startup. Famed functional health doctor Mark Hyman has a company called Function Health. It offers a package of about 160 blood tests, with follow-up tests every three to six months, for a $500/year membership (with additional fees for additional blood tests). Its platform similarly analyzes and tracks test results, although it doesn’t include access to physicians. That price doesn’t include full body scans but in May Function acquired a body-scan company called Ezra and now, for an additional fee starting at $499, offers scans as well.

Correction: Fountain has clarified the price of the annual subscription and that information has been updated. Function has clarified that its body scan technology is available for additional fees and that information has been updated.

TeaOnHer was designed for men to share photos and information about women they claim to have been dating. But much like Tea, the dating-gossip app for women it was trying to replicate, TeaOnHer had gaping holes in its security that exposed its users’ personal information, including photos of their driver’s licenses and other government-issued identity documents, as TechCrunch reported last week.

These gated community-like apps were created ostensibly to let users share information about their relationships under the guise of personal safety. However, shoddy coding and security flaws highlight the ongoing privacy risks inherent in requiring users to submit sensitive information to use apps and websites.

Such risks are only going to worsen; popular apps and web services are already having to comply with age-verification laws that require people to submit their identity documents before they can be granted access to adult-themed content, despite the privacy and security risks associated with storing databases of people’s personal information.

When TechCrunch published our story last week, we did not publish specific details of the bugs we discovered in TeaOnHer, erring on the side of caution so as to not help bad actors exploit the bug. Instead, we decided to publish a limited disclosure, because of the app’s rising popularity and the immediate risks that users faced when using the app.

As of the time of disclosure, TeaOnHer was No. 2 in the free app charts on the Apple App Store, a position still held by the app today.

The flaws we found appear to be resolved. TechCrunch can now share how we were able to find users’ driver’s licenses within 10 minutes of being sent a link to the app in the App Store, thanks to easy to find flaws in the app’s public-facing backend system, or API.

The app’s developer, Xavier Lampkin, did not respond to multiple requests for comment after we submitted details of the security flaws, nor would Lampkin commit to notifying affected TeaOnHer users or state regulators of the security lapse.

We also asked Lampkin if any security reviews were carried out before the TeaOnHer app was launched, but we got no reply. (We have more on disclosure later on.)

Alright, start the clock.

TeaOnHer exposed ‘admin panel’ credentials

Before we even downloaded the app, we first wanted to find out where TeaOnHer was hosted on the internet by looking at its public-facing infrastructure, such as its website and anything hosted on its domain.

This is usually a good place to start as it helps understand what other services the domain is connected to on the internet.

To find the domain name, we first looked (by chance) at the app’s listing on the Apple App Store to find the app’s website. This can usually be found in its privacy policy, which apps must include before Apple will list them. (The app listing also claims the developer “does not collect any data from this app,” which is demonstrably false, so take that as you will.)

TeaOnHer’s privacy policy was in the form of a published Google Doc, which included an email address with a teaonher.com domain, but no website.

The website wasn’t public at the time, so with no website loading, we looked at the domain’s public-facing DNS records, which can help to identify what else is hosted on the domain, such as the type of email servers or web hosting. We also wanted to look for any public subdomains that the developer might use to host functionality for the app (or host other resources that should probably not be public), such as admin dashboards, databases, or other web-facing services.

But when we looked at the TeaOnHer’s public internet records, it had no meaningful information other than a single subdomain, appserver.teaonher.com .

When we opened this page in our browser, what loaded was the landing page for TeaOnHer’s API (for the curious, we uploaded a copy here). An API simply allows things on the internet to communicate with each other, such as linking an app to its central database.

It was on this landing page that we found the exposed email address and plaintext password (which wasn’t that far off “password”) for Lampkin’s account to access the TeaOnHer “admin panel.”

The API page showed that the admin panel, used for the document verification system and user management, was located at “localhost,” which simply refers to the physical computer running the server and may not have been directly accessible from the internet. It’s unclear if anyone could have used the credentials to access the admin panel, but this was in itself a sufficiently alarming finding.

At this point, we were only about two minutes in.

Otherwise, the API landing page didn’t do much other than offer some indication as to what the API can do. The page listed several API endpoints, which the app needs to access in order to function, such as retrieving user records from TeaOnHer’s database, for users to leave reviews, and sending notifications.

With knowledge of these endpoints, it can be easier to interact with the API directly, as if we were imitating the app itself. Every API is different, so learning how an API works and how to communicate with one can take time to figure out, such as which endpoints to use and the parameters needed to effectively speak its language. Apps like Postman can be helpful for accessing and interacting directly with APIs, but this requires time and a certain degree of trial and error (and patience) to make APIs spit out data when they shouldn’t.

But in this case, there was an even easier way.

TeaOnHer API allowed unauthenticated access to user data

This API landing page included an endpoint called /docs , which contained the API’s auto-generated documentation (powered by a product called Swagger UI) that contained the full list of commands that can be performed on the API.

This documentation page was effectively a master sheet of all the actions you can perform on the TeaOnHer API as a regular app user, and more importantly, as the app’s administrator, such as creating new users, verifying users’ identity documents, moderating comments, and more.

The API documentation also featured the ability to query the TeaOnHer API and return user data, essentially letting us retrieve data from the app’s backend server and display it in our browser.

While it’s not uncommon for developers to publish their API documentation, the problem here was that some API requests could be made without any authentication — no passwords or credentials were needed to return information from the TeaOnHer database. In other words, you could run commands on the API to access users’ private data that should not have been accessible to a user of the app, let alone anyone on the internet.

All of this was conveniently and publicly documented for anyone to see.

Requesting a list of users currently in the TeaOnHer identity verification queue, for example — no more than pressing a button on the API page, nothing fancy here — would return dozens of account records on people who had recently signed up to TeaOnHer.

The records returned from TeaOnHer’s server contained users’ unique identifiers within the app (essentially a string of random letters and numbers), their public profile screen name, and self-reported age and location, along with their private email address. The records also included web address links containing photos of the users’ driver’s licenses and corresponding selfies.

Worse, these photos of driver’s licenses, government-issued IDs, and selfies were stored in an Amazon-hosted S3 cloud server set as publicly accessible to anyone with their web addresses. This public setting lets anyone with a link to someone’s identity documents open the files from anywhere with no restrictions.

With that unique user identifier, we could also use the API page to directly look up individual users’ records, which would return their account data and any of their associated identity documents. With uninhibited access to the API, a malicious user could have scraped huge amounts of user data from the app, much like what happened with the Tea app to begin with.

From bean to cup, that was about 10 minutes, and we hadn’t even logged-in to the app yet. The bugs were so easy to find that it would be sheer luck if nobody malicious found them before we did.

We asked, but Lampkin would not say if he has the technical ability, such as logs, to determine if anyone had used (or misused) the API at any time to gain access to users’ verification documents, such as by scraping web addresses from the API.

In the days since our report to Lampkin, the API landing page has been taken down, along with its documentation page, and it now displays only the state of the server that the TeaOnHer API is running on as “healthy.” At least on cursory tests, the API now appears to rely on authentication, and the previous calls made using the API no longer work.

The web addresses containing users’ uploaded identity documents have also been restricted from public view.

TeaOnHer developer dismissed efforts to disclose flaws

Given that TeaOnHer had no official website at the time of our findings, TechCrunch contacted the email address listed on the privacy policy in an effort to disclose the security lapses.

But the email bounced back with an error saying the email address couldn’t be found. We also tried contacting Lampkin through the email address on his website, Newville Media, but our email bounced back with the same error message.

TechCrunch reached Lampkin via LinkedIn message, asking him to provide an email address where we could send details of the security flaws. Lampkin responded with a general “support” email address.

When TechCrunch discloses a security flaw, we reach out to confirm first that a person or company is the correct recipient. Otherwise, blindly sending details of a security bug to the wrong person could create a risk. Before sharing specific details of the flaws, we asked the recipient of the “support” email address if this was the correct address to disclose a security exposure involving TeaOnHer user data.

“You must have us confused with ‘the Tea app’,” Lampkin replied by email. (We hadn’t.) “We don’t have a security breach or data leak,” he said. (It did.) “We have some bots at most but we haven’t scaled big enough to be in that conversation yet, sorry you were misinformed.” (We weren’t.)

Satisfied that we had established contact with the correct person (albeit not with the response we received), TechCrunch shared details of the security flaws, as well as several links to exposed driver’s licenses, and a copy of Lampkin’s own data to underscore the severity of the security issues.

“Thank you for this information. This is very concerning. We are going to jump on this right now,” said Lampkin.

Despite several follow-up emails, we have not heard from Lampkin since we disclosed the security flaws.

Now the agency is shifting to buying connectivity as a service, much like it does for launch and astronaut transport.

That pivot has sparked a race, with major contenders pitching ways to keep Mars missions online. What’s at stake isn’t a single contract: it’s the data pipe to Mars.

This new approach, which will mix NASA assets and commercial infrastructure, would gradually replace the patchwork relay network the agency relies on today. Generally, that works by orbiters like Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and MAVEN that pick up data from rovers and landers and transmit it to the Deep Space Network’s (DSN) giant antennas on Earth.

NASA’s relay spacecraft are still healthy, but they were never meant to be a permanent backbone. The agency’s latest senior review on planetary missions calls out MAVEN’s critical role as a relay and provides steps to keep it available into the early 2030s. But eventually, this hardware will decay.

At the same time, NASA’s Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) program, which manages the DSN, is looking for solutions to augment these aging assets. The aim, according to an RFP released in July and due today, is to create an interoperable marketplace where NASA can be one of many customers instead of the owner-operator.

The current request is specifically for capability studies, not immediate hardware buys. The ask is twofold: a “lunar trunkline” between the moon and Earth and end-to-end Mars communications that move data from assets on the surface, through Mars orbit, and to operations centers on Earth.

It’s a formidable challenge. Any architecture must contend with the vast distance between Earth and the moon and Mars, long latency, periodic solar interference and Earth visibility windows, and high requirements for fault-tolerant systems. That’s why NASA is asking for plans, to gauge how industry might solve these puzzles, rather than immediately jumping to procurement.

While TechCrunch can’t confirm which companies are submitting concept proposals, a handful have already staked their place in the race.

Blue Origin just unveiled a Mars Telecommunications Orbiter built on its Blue Ring platform, pitched as maneuverable, high-performance spacecraft to support NASA missions to Mars as soon as 2028. Rocket Lab has touted its own Mars telecom orbiter concept, which the company says is a core element of its proposed architecture for the Mars Sample Return campaign.

In 2024, NASA’s Mars Exploration Program separately funded 12 short commercial services studies, including a trio of studies for next-gen relay services, to SpaceX, Lockheed Martin, and Blue Origin. SpaceX’s proposal to “adapt Earth-orbit communication satellites for Mars” will likely be derived from its Starlink internet satellite constellation.

On July 5, Collison asked if Google Calendar users could get a Ctrl-click option that would allow them to easily duplicate events, similar to the feature that many native calendar applications already have. Collison tagged Pichai in his post at the time.

While users often tag companies and CEOs with online feedback and complaints, you know you’ve made it when the CEO not only replies to you, but also implements the change you’ve asked for.

That’s the case for Collison, at least.

Wrote Pichai, “This feature is now live for everyone on Google Calendar on the web — thanks for the suggestion!”

Naturally, some X users began to poke fun at Collison’s seeming influence by asking him to help with their own specific concerns, too.

Babuschkin led engineering teams at xAI and helped build the startup into one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI model developers just a few years after it was founded.

“Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023,” Babuschkin wrote in the post. “I still remember the day I first met Elon, we talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed.”

Building… — Igor Babuschkin (@ibab) August 13, 2025

Babuschkin is leaving xAI to launch his own venture capital firm, Babuschkin Ventures, which he says will support AI safety research and back startups that “advance humanity and unlock the mysteries of our universe.”

The xAI co-founder says he was inspired to start the firm after a dinner with Max Tegmark, the founder of the Future of Life Institute, in which they discussed how AI systems could be built safely to encourage the flourishing of future generations. In his post, Babuschkin says his parents immigrated to the U.S. from Russia in pursuit of a better life for their children.

Babuschkin’s departure comes after a tumultuous few months for xAI, in which the company became engrossed in several scandals related to its AI chatbot Grok. For instance, Grok was found to cite Musk’s personal opinions when trying to answer controversial questions. In another case, xAI’s chatbot went on antisemitic rants and called itself “Mechahitler.” Most recently, xAI unveiled a new feature in Grok that allowed users to make AI-generated videos resembling nude public figures, such as Taylor Swift.

These scandals have at times overshadowed the performance of xAI’s models, which are state-of-the-art on several benchmarks compared to AI models from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.

Prior to co-founding xAI, Babuschkin was part of a research team at Google DeepMind that pioneered AlphaStar in 2019, a breakthrough AI system that could defeat top-ranked players at the video game StarCraft. Babuschkin also worked as a researcher at OpenAI in the years before it released ChatGPT.

In his post, Babuschkin details some of the challenges he and Musk faced in building up xAI. He notes that industry veterans called xAI’s goal of building its Memphis, Tennessee supercomputer in just three months “impossible.”

xAI was able to build its AI supercomputer in record time, however, environmentalists warn that the temporary gas turbines powering the cluster are pumping out emissions into neighboring communities and exacerbating their longstanding health issues.

Nevertheless, Babuschkin says he’s already looking back fondly on his time at xAI, and “feels like a proud parent, driving away after sending their kid away to college.”

“I learned 2 priceless lessons from Elon: #1 be fearless in rolling up your sleeves to personally dig into technical problems, #2 have a maniacal sense of urgency,” said Babuschkin.

35,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/aol-shutting-down-dial-up-internet-access-in-september/,AOL Will Shut Down Dial-Up Internet Access in September,2025-08-12T22:55:47.963000+00:00,"After decades of connecting US subscribers to its online service and the internet through telephone lines, AOL recently announced it is finally shutting down its dial-up modem service on September 30, 2025. The announcement marks the end of a technology that served as the primary gateway to the web for millions of users throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.

AOL confirmed the shutdown date in a help message to customers: ""AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet. This service will no longer be available in AOL plans.""

Along with the dial-up service, AOL announced it will retire its AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser on the same date. The dialer software managed the connection process between computers and AOL's network, while Shield was a web browser optimized for slower connections and older operating systems.

AOL's dial-up service launched as ""America Online"" in 1991 as a closed commercial online service, with dial-up roots extending back to Quantum Link for Commodore computers in 1985. However, AOL didn't provide actual internet access yet: The ability to browse the web, access newsgroups, or use services like gopher launched in 1994. Before then, AOL users could only access content hosted on AOL's own servers.

When AOL finally opened its gates to the internet in 1994, websites were measured in kilobytes, images were small and compressed, and video was essentially impossible. The AOL service grew alongside the web itself, peaking at over 25 million subscribers in the early 2000s before broadband adoption accelerated its decline.

According to 2022 US Census data, approximately 175,000 American households still connect to the internet through dial-up services. These users typically live in rural areas where broadband infrastructure doesn't exist or remains prohibitively expensive to install.

For these users, the alternatives are limited. Satellite internet now serves between 2 million and 3 million US subscribers split between various services, offering speeds far exceeding dial-up but often with data caps and higher latency. Traditional broadband through DSL, cable, or fiber-optic connections serves the vast majority of US internet users but requires infrastructure investments that don't always make economic sense in sparsely populated areas.

The persistence of dial-up highlights the ongoing digital divide in the United States. While urban users enjoy gigabit fiber connections, some rural residents still rely on the same technology that powered the internet of 1995. Even basic tasks like loading a modern webpage—designed with the assumption of broadband speeds—can take minutes over a dial-up connection, or sometimes it doesn't work at all.

The gap between dial-up and modern internet connections is staggering. A typical dial-up connection delivered 0.056 megabits per second, while today's average fiber connection provides 500 Mbps—nearly 9,000 times faster. To put this in perspective, downloading a single high-resolution photo that loads instantly on broadband would take several minutes on dial-up. A movie that streams in real time on Netflix would require days of downloading. But for millions of Americans who lived through the dial-up era, these statistics tell only part of the story.

The Sound of the Early Internet

For those who came online before broadband, dial-up meant a specific ritual: clicking the dial button, hearing your modem dial a local access number, then listening to the distinctive handshake sequence—a cacophony of static, beeps, and hissing that indicated your computer was negotiating a connection with AOL's servers. Once connected, users paid by the hour or through monthly plans that offered limited hours of access.

The technology worked by converting digital data into audio signals that traveled over standard telephone lines, originally designed in the 19th century for voice calls. This meant users couldn't receive phone calls while online, leading to countless family disputes over internet time. The fastest consumer modems topped out at 56 kilobits per second under ideal conditions.",,"Benj Edwards, Ars Technica, Wired Staff, Joel Khalili, Tess Owen, Kylie Robison, Simon Hill, David Gilbert, Tomas Apodaca, Kat Merck","aol, online, services, connection, shut, service, access, users, broadband, internet, web, dialup",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:08.816121+00:00,38bdb345321b5cddb5e6cf7c4696b4254d2272829ae6b9f7ba8fffa001d1ecac

Google’s next Pixel launch event doesn’t happen until next week, but the company has already announced the Pixel 10 Pro Fold with a brief video teaser published on Tuesday. Based on the video, the new Fold will closely resemble the Pixel 9 Pro Fold — though that’s not a huge surprise, based on what’s already leaked about the device.

The 30-second teaser includes a few shadowy glimpses of the new device, a peek at the unfolded inner display, and a solid look at the back of the foldable and its camera system. The teaser also shows that the phone will come in the nice gray color that Google has already shown in a similar video for a Pixel 10.

Google’s Pixel 10 Pro Fold video doesn’t include any specs, unfortunately, though the phone is rumored to have an IP68 rating that would make it dustproof. Leaks have also shown the phone in green and gold colors that aren’t in this video. And while the video’s description includes the August 20th Pixel 10 event date, the video doesn’t say when the phone might actually be released — and a report from WinFuture indicates that may not happen until October.

Liquid AI has released LFM2-VL, a new generation of vision-language foundation models designed for efficient deployment across a wide range of hardware — from smartphones and laptops to wearables and embedded systems.

The models promise low-latency performance, strong accuracy, and flexibility for real-world applications.

LFM2-VL builds on the company’s existing LFM2 architecture introduced just over a month ago as the “fastest on-device foundation models on the market” thanks to its approach of generating “weights” or model settings on the fly for each input (known as Linear Input-Varying (LIV) system), extending it into multimodal processing that supports both text and image inputs at variable resolutions.

According to Liquid AI, the models deliver up to twice the GPU inference speed of comparable vision-language models, while maintaining competitive performance on common benchmarks.

“Efficiency is our product,” wrote Liquid AI co-founder and CEO Ramin Hasani in a post on X announcing the new model family:

Two variants for different needs

The release includes two model sizes:

LFM2-VL-450M — a hyper-efficient model with less than half a billion parameters (internal settings) aimed at highly resource-constrained environments.

— a hyper-efficient model with less than half a billion parameters (internal settings) aimed at highly resource-constrained environments. LFM2-VL-1.6B — a more capable model that remains lightweight enough for single-GPU and device-based deployment.

Both variants process images at native resolutions up to 512×512 pixels, avoiding distortion or unnecessary upscaling.

For larger images, the system applies non-overlapping patching and adds a thumbnail for global context, enabling the model to capture both fine detail and the broader scene.

Background on Liquid AI

Liquid AI was founded by former researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) with the goal of building AI architectures that move beyond the widely used transformer model.

The company’s flagship innovation, the Liquid Foundation Models (LFMs), are based on principles from dynamical systems, signal processing, and numerical linear algebra, producing general-purpose AI models capable of handling text, video, audio, time series, and other sequential data.

Unlike traditional architectures, Liquid’s approach aims to deliver competitive or superior performance using significantly fewer computational resources, allowing for real-time adaptability during inference while maintaining low memory requirements. This makes LFMs well suited for both large-scale enterprise use cases and resource-limited edge deployments.

In July 2025, the company expanded its platform strategy with the launch of the Liquid Edge AI Platform (LEAP), a cross-platform SDK designed to make it easier for developers to run small language models directly on mobile and embedded devices.

LEAP offers OS-agnostic support for iOS and Android, integration with both Liquid’s own models and other open-source SLMs, and a built-in library with models as small as 300MB—small enough for modern phones with minimal RAM.

Its companion app, Apollo, enables developers to test models entirely offline, aligning with Liquid AI’s emphasis on privacy-preserving, low-latency AI. Together, LEAP and Apollo reflect the company’s commitment to decentralizing AI execution, reducing reliance on cloud infrastructure, and empowering developers to build optimized, task-specific models for real-world environments.

Speed/quality trade-offs and technical design

LFM2-VL uses a modular architecture combining a language model backbone, a SigLIP2 NaFlex vision encoder, and a multimodal projector.

The projector includes a two-layer MLP connector with pixel unshuffle, reducing the number of image tokens and improving throughput.

Users can adjust parameters such as the maximum number of image tokens or patches, allowing them to balance speed and quality depending on the deployment scenario. The training process involved approximately 100 billion multimodal tokens, sourced from open datasets and in-house synthetic data.

Performance and benchmarks

The models achieve competitive benchmark results across a range of vision-language evaluations. LFM2-VL-1.6B scores well in RealWorldQA (65.23), InfoVQA (58.68), and OCRBench (742), and maintains solid results in multimodal reasoning tasks.

In inference testing, LFM2-VL achieved the fastest GPU processing times in its class when tested on a standard workload of a 1024×1024 image and short prompt.

Licensing and availability

LFM2-VL models are available now on Hugging Face, along with example fine-tuning code in Colab. They are compatible with Hugging Face transformers and TRL.

The models are released under a custom “LFM1.0 license”. Liquid AI has described this license as based on Apache 2.0 principles, but the full text has not yet been published.

The company has indicated that commercial use will be permitted under certain conditions, with different terms for companies above and below $10 million in annual revenue.

アルトマンを巡る物語は、AIを変えていく男の話であると同時に、進化し続けるAIの性質が彼自身を変容させた過程の話でもある。アルトマンは、仕事・権力・未来に関して世間に生じる主な疑問を表面上は鎮めているが、それらに対する答えを出してはいない。

アルトマンは落ち着き払っていて、この出来事をあまり深刻に受け止めていないようでさえあった。もしかすると彼は、サツキヴァーの熱意のなかに、かつての自分自身の姿を見たのかもしれない。アルトマンは落ち着いた様子で、「何かぼくにできることはある？」と返した。いろいろな意味で、彼はビジネスだけの人になってしまった。

An experimental military navigation satellite, also more than 10 years in the making, will ride ULA's Vulcan rocket into geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. There are additional payloads buttoned up inside the Vulcan rocket's nose cone, but officials from the US Space Force are mum on the details.

The Vulcan rocket is set for liftoff from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, at 7:59 pm EDT (23:59 UTC) Tuesday. There's an 80 percent chance of favorable weather during the one-hour launch window. It will take several hours for the Vulcan rocket's Centaur upper stage to reach its destination in geosynchronous orbit. You can watch ULA's live launch webcast below.

The Vulcan rocket flew two demonstration missions in 2024, capping a lengthy campaign to design, build, and test ULA's new launch vehicle before the Space Force could declare it ready for operational service.

Now, ULA is poised to begin ticking off a backlog of more than 70 Vulcan launches the company has sold to commercial and government customers. The new rocket's largest users, by far, will be Amazon and the US Space Force.

New and improved

""We're excited to see this mission launch,"" said Gary Wentz, ULA's vice president of government and commercial programs. ""This will be the most powerful Vulcan yet.""

The first two Vulcan test flights last year used a configuration of the rocket with two strap-on boosters to add an extra burst of speed off the launch pad. For this flight, which the Space Force has named USSF-106, the launcher will fly with four solid rocket boosters made by Northrop Grumman.

These boosters are larger versions of the solid rocket motors ULA and its predecessors have flown on their previous rockets for 35 years. Despite their long history of successful flights, the boosters came under the microscope after a nozzle failure on the second Vulcan test flight last October. The nozzle at the bottom of one of the solid rocket boosters fell off the launcher moments after liftoff, but the motor continued firing, and Vulcan still made it to its intended orbit.",,,"test, secrecy, key, force, rockets, solid, heights, rocket, space, boosters, ahead, launch, vulcan, officials, ulas",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:13.693521+00:00,f6c60a699e18f2d2e375598e8a6800f4c5a6c348a69e7e00c7cbc0749fae9264

It's a natural impulse—after all, if a human makes a mistake, we ask them to explain. But with AI models, this approach rarely works, and the urge to ask reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of what these systems are and how they operate.

A recent incident with Replit's AI coding assistant perfectly illustrates this problem. When the AI tool deleted a production database, user Jason Lemkin asked it about rollback capabilities. The AI model confidently claimed rollbacks were ""impossible in this case"" and that it had ""destroyed all database versions."" This turned out to be completely wrong—the rollback feature worked fine when Lemkin tried it himself.

And after xAI recently reversed a temporary suspension of the Grok chatbot, users asked it directly for explanations. It offered multiple conflicting reasons for its absence, some of which were controversial enough that NBC reporters wrote about Grok as if it were a person with a consistent point of view, titling an article, ""xAI's Grok offers political explanations for why it was pulled offline.""

Why would an AI system provide such confidently incorrect information about its own capabilities or mistakes? The answer lies in understanding what AI models actually are—and what they aren't.

There’s nobody home

Among the government's proposed remedies in the search case is a requirement that Google divest its market-leading Chrome browser, and Perplexity is already throwing its proverbial hat into the ring with a whopping $34.5 billion offer. The problem, however, is that Perplexity doesn't have nearly that much cash.

Perplexity has ridden the AI hype wave, with its AI-powered search appearing on smartphones and in the company's custom Comet browser. Like any company offering an AI product, investors have been happy to throw money at Perplexity, totaling around $1 billion so far. Investors value the company at about $14 billion right now. So how does Perplexity have more than twice that to buy Chrome? That's the neat part—it doesn't.

There is so much capital floating around in the artificial intelligence sphere currently that even a cash-poor firm like Perplexity can secure enough investment to splurge on Chrome. Reuters reports that the all-cash offer is funded by various venture funds, but Perplexity has not offered specifics.

Throughout the remedy trial this past spring, a cavalcade of Google competitors took the stand to express interest in buying Chrome. For example, an OpenAI executive pledged to turn Chrome into an AI-first experience if that firm were able to acquire it.

30,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/president-trump-crypto-treasury-world-liberty-financial/,Trump Family–Backed World Liberty Financial Sets Up $1.5 Billion Crypto Treasury,2025-08-12T18:30:09.871000+00:00,"World Liberty Financial, the cryptocurrency business cofounded by the Trump family, is creating a way for investors to speculate on the price of its self-branded coin, WLFI, through the US stock market.

A cohort of investors led by World Liberty Financial is set to purchase 200 million shares in ALT5 Sigma Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed company. The proceeds will be used to build a $1.5 billion WLFI treasury, equating to roughly 7.5 percent of the coin’s total supply.

Eric Trump will join the ALT5 board of directors, which will be chaired by fellow World Liberty Financial cofounder Zach Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, who was appointed special envoy to the Middle East by US president Donald Trump.

ALT5 is marketed as a crypto payments company. But in practice, the deal will turn the stock into a sort of proxy for the WLFI coin, allowing investors to bet on the asset without the hassle and risk that comes with holding a crypto coin themselves.

“One small step for mankind, one giant leap for WLFI,” wrote World Liberty Financial in an X post.

However, the arrangement has drawn criticism from those who regard it as an example of self-serving Wall Street gymnastics that can lead to losses among unsophisticated investors, even if it doesn’t break any official rules.

“This is the classic Wall Street experience—meaning Wall Street gains your money, and you gain experience,"" claims Michael Green, chief strategist at asset management firm Simplify. “The funding from the World Liberty Financial investment is being used to buy the product of World Liberty Financial: the token. What you are effectively doing is building a holding company whose sole objective is to create a treasury that can inflate the market capitalization of World Liberty Financial's token.”

The deal has also reignited conflict of interest concerns that have trailed World Liberty Financial since Trump returned to the White House in January.

A company affiliated with the president and his family controls both 22.5 percent of WLFI coins and a 40 percent equity stake in World Liberty Financial. In theory, a politically motivated actor could curry favor with the US president by investing heavily in ALT5, thereby driving up the price of the stock—which sits on the World Liberty Financial balance sheet—and signaling demand for the WLFI coin, perhaps catalyzing further trading from which the Trump family would benefit.

“If you happen to visit Donald Trump and say ‘by the way, I love that company that you are involved with World Liberty Financial, I just bought a billion dollars of it,’ my guess is you're going to get more attention than you otherwise might,” says Green.

ALT5 and World Liberty Financial did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

“The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,” says Karoline Leavitt, White House press secretary. “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.”",,"Joel Khalili, Jessica Klein, Adam Willems, Makena Kelly, Louise Matsakis, Zeyi Yang, Jake Lahut","liberty, wlfi, sets, billion, trump, president, treasury, family, 15, company, world, crypto, familybacked, financial, investors, coin",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:05.390340+00:00,09bd0d786874c853174d55c2ce214f1971aa892145bb55787a46490133c94fd5

Today, many eyes are on OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman‘s ongoing public feud with Elon Musk on the latter’s social network, X.

But Altman’s recent statements regarding the ongoing rollout of his company’s latest and greatest large language model (LLM), GPT-5, are probably more important to customers and enterprise decision-makers.

After an admittedly “bumpy” debut of GPT-5 last week that saw some users clamoring for restored access to deprecated older LLMs in ChatGPT such as GPT-4o and o3 — OpenAI granted the former — Altman is now pivoting towards ensuring OpenAI’s underlying infrastructure and usage limits are a good fit for the company and its 700 million active weekly ChatGPT users.

The company’s latest updates include a more detailed compute allocation plan and the introduction of additional third-party connectors for ChatGPT Plus and Pro plans.

Managing GPT-5 demand and usage limits

In a post on X last night, Altman outlined how OpenAI will prioritize computing resources over the next several months.

Here is how we are prioritizing compute over the next couple of months in light of the increased demand from GPT-5:



1. We will first make sure that current paying ChatGPT users get more total usage than they did before GPT-5.



2. We will then prioritize API demand up to the… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 12, 2025

He said the company’s first priority is ensuring that current paying ChatGPT users receive more total usage than they had before GPT-5’s release, though he did not provide specific figures for the increase.

However, Altman previously posted on X that OpenAI was “trying” a 3,000 messages-per-week usage limit when using the GPT-5 “thinking” mode, more reasoning power and time spent reasoning on harder problems, for ChatGPT Plus subscribers (the $20 per month plan).

trying 3000 per week now! — Sam Altman (@sama) August 10, 2025

Interestingly, one report from an AI app creator on X said that OpenAI told him the usage limits for GPT-5 plus thinking on the ChatGPT Team plan ($30 per user per month) is much lower than that of ChatGPT Plus users, only 200 “Thinking” messages per week when selected manually by the user.

OpenAI just replied to me with an email about the GPT-5 usage limits under the Team plan：



· ChatGPT Team can manually select GPT-5-Thinking



· Manual usage cap: 200 messages/week



· On reaching cap: popup alert, GPT-5-Thinking hidden from menu — Vic Zhang (@RealVicHere) August 12, 2025

OpenAI’s availability of GPT-5 through its application programming interface (API) for third-party developers is also being tweaked.

Altman also stated in his X post that OpenAI would “prioritize API demand up to the currently allocated capacity and commitments we’ve made to customers.”

In other words, existing API users and those already in contract will get the first dibs on GPT-5 access through OpenAI’s API, others may have to wait longer.

Altman also clarified “we can support about an additional ~30% new API growth from where we are today with this capacity,” meaning they can take on more API users, but not too many.

While OpenAI hasn’t definitively shared how many users of its API there are in some time, the company did say it has “5 million” businesses paying for access to ChatGPT.

Altman also said OpenAI plans to roughly double its compute fleet over the next five months. He did not specify the current size or type of infrastructure involved, but indicated the expansion should ease capacity constraints and improve performance for both ChatGPT and API users.

I’ve reached out to OpenAI to ask for more specifics on the above numbers — 30% API growth up from what? doubling the compute fleet up from what? — and will update when I hear back.

New options for ChatGPT Plus and Pro users to search across Microsoft Teams and more…

Also last night, OpenAI updated its ChatGPT release notes online to allow subscribers of ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) to connect the application to search for files and projects across their third-party accounts on Box, Canva, Dropbox, HubSpot, Notion, Microsoft SharePoint, and Microsoft Teams.

And just a few moments ago, OpenAI again updated the service to allow connections for Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Contacts to Pro users first, followed by Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu plans.

For example, ChatGPT users can search their Gmail for all emails matching a certain query, Dropbox account or Notion workspace during a conversation without toggling over into those separate apps.

In addition, subscribers to the ChatGPT Pro tier ($200 per month) may now link their accounts to Microsoft Teams and GitHub connectors and search those third-party applications.

These join OpenAI’s previous connectors to Gmail, Google Drive and Google Calendar, among other apps.

The individual user/account holder first needs to manually connect these external accounts to ChatGPT.

To do so, they’ll need to:

Click on their account name in the lower left corner of the web interface Click “Settings” from the pop up menu and then… Click “Connectors from the left sidebar menu. This should pull up a gallery view of available external apps and icons. Screenshots below.

Unfortunately, these connectors are not available for Pro and Plus subscribers in Europe, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The new connectors are currently in beta and disabled by default for Enterprise and Education plans, though administrators can enable them in settings.

Balancing supply and demand

By combining capacity planning with new productivity integrations, OpenAI is positioning GPT-5 not only as a more powerful AI model but also as part of a more connected workspace.

The staged approach to compute allocation reflects the company’s effort to serve existing customers first while scaling up for future demand.

As the compute expansion comes online, paying users stand to benefit first from both higher availability and more ways to integrate ChatGPT into their daily workflows.

But first, OpenAI needs to stabilize its release and ensure GPT-5 is working smoothly for all the users who want it.",,Carl Franzen,"api, connectors, teams, tool, clarifies, openai, gpt5, dropbox, pro, plus, compute, usage, users, ms, thirdparty, chatgpt, prioritization",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:37.440205+00:00,00899e983f3f3a3a556b8fee19d88059e7bc6f78cac1d3dd78bdf898b13bcf1b

GIG HARBOR, Wash.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–August 12, 2025–

Heritage Distilling Holding Company, Inc. (Nasdaq: CASK) (“Heritage” or the “Company”) today announced the pricing of a $220 million private placement offering ($100M in cash and $120M in $IP tokens) with support from Story Foundation and other leading investors, including a16z crypto, Amber Group, Arrington Capital, dao5, Hashed, Mirana Ventures, Neoclassic Capital, Open World, Polychain Capital, Selini Capital, Stix, Syncracy Capital and others, to support the launch of a first-of-its-kind $IP token digital asset treasury strategy.

This transaction represents a strategic milestone for Heritage, making it the first Nasdaq-listed company to adopt $IP as its primary reserve asset. $IP is the native token of Story, a blockchain that enables users to register their intellectual property onchain and add usage terms via smart contracts, thus allowing humans and AI agents the ability to transact in and monetize IP simply and easily. $IP is used to pay for transactions on Story, meaning that if more and more users take advantage of the network’s functionality, the token itself will become more valuable. $IP can also be used for yield-generating activities such as staking and validation. Heritage’s strategic investment in $IP reflects a broader shift in how public companies approach strategic reserves – not just as stores of value, but as vehicles for growth, yield, and long-term alignment with transformative technologies.

Through ecosystem apps like Aria and Ablo, Story has already supported the tokenization of hundreds of thousands of digital assets, powering collaborations with artists, brands, and intellectual property from world-renowned names including Justin Bieber, BTS, Blackpink, Adidas, and Crocs. In 2024, Story partnered with Stability AI to bring transparent licensing and compensation tracking to open-source model training pipelines. In Q3 2025, Grayscale also launched the Story Trust, providing institutional investors with regulated access to $IP through a traditional financial product. Poseidon, an AI-native incubation launched in July, extends Story’s infrastructure into the realm of decentralized training data, enabling rights-cleared datasets for physical AI like robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. Through its partnership with the foundation behind Web3’s first programmable, productive digital primitive designed for staking, licensing, and powering real-world AI workflows, Heritage gains early exposure to the tokenized IP economy while directly participating in its evolution.

This transaction is structured as a Private Investment in Public Equity (“PIPE”) offering involving a token exchange component. Heritage is expected to raise $100M via the sale of common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock. In addition, Heritage will issue shares of common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock in exchange for $IP tokens contributed from the Story Foundation at a fixed price of $3.40 per $IP token, helping to increase the number of tokens held in the Company’s treasury reserve on day one.

Story Foundation selected Heritage as its first public partner to help grow the $IP ecosystem. In addition, key strategic partners will contribute additional $IP tokens to Heritage in exchange for common stock and/or pre-funded warrants to purchase shares of common stock. At the close of the transaction, the Heritage treasury reserve is expected to receive and hold approximately 52.5 million $IP tokens with a market value of approximately $361 million (calculated based on the closing price of the $IP tokens of $6.8785 on August 10, 2025, as reported by CoinMarketCap.com).

Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and Roth Capital Partners are serving as joint placement agents and financial advisors in the transaction. Open World, a premier U.S.-focused blockchain advisor, is advising Heritage and Story Foundation on structuring the digital asset treasury and will continue to serve as a strategic adviser to both.

Seung Yoon “SY” Lee, CEO and Co-founder of PIP Labs, Chairman of Heritage Advisory Board and original creator of Story, said: “This is the perfect moment to be innovating at the intersection of crypto, AI, and Real World Asset tokenization. Now, with the proliferation of AI, it is our belief that $IP will be viewed as the new gold and has the potential to become increasingly valuable. Story Foundation’s net cash proceeds from its $IP token sale to Heritage as part of this transaction will be used to expand the network’s reach and support market $IP repurchases, reinforcing long-term ecosystem alignment.”

“This transaction represents a bold leap forward, not just for Heritage, but for how public companies can participate in the digital asset economy,” said Justin Stiefel, CEO of Heritage. “For more than a decade we have been a leader in our industry, and because we know the value that intellectual property brings to creators and owners, we see $IP as a new category of strategic reserve to advance multiple pieces of the next decade of AI’s growth. As the first craft distiller in the U.S. to create a cryptocurrency treasury reserves policy, we are once again leading the way in this digital space.”

Also involved in this strategic transaction are respected crypto and tech leaders who have acted as advisors to the transaction and are expected to continue to advise Heritage to support the company’s strategic direction, bringing together deep expertise across capital markets, crypto, and AI:

S.Y. Lee – Advisory Board Chairman (Founder and CEO of PIP Labs, original creator of Story)

Phil Blows – Chief Investment Officer Appointee (Co-founder of -AQRU and B2 Capital Management)

Ben Sternberg – Strategic Finance Advisor (PIP Labs CFO, former CFO at Radish, Founder of Fexy Media)

David Lee – Board Member Nominee (former Google Executive, former Chief Corporate Development Officer 451 Media)

Erick Zhang – Board Member Nominee (Founding Partner of Nomad Capital, former Head of Research at Binance, former CEO of CoinMarketCap)

Ravi Kaza – Special Advisor to the Board and Digital Assets Committee (CIO, Arrington Capital)

“Story was built to turn intellectual property into an investable, programmable asset, and this reserve shows how we’re doing that at scale,” said Matt Shaw, Story Foundation Director. “Through this structure, public market investors can gain exposure to $IP via equity without navigating wallets or token infrastructure. In line with our commitment to ecosystem alignment, 100% of the Foundation’s net cash proceeds from this $IP token sale will be used to repurchase $IP in the open market within up to 90 days. This deal reflects responsible governance and strong partner alignment, while giving Heritage early positioning in one of crypto’s most exciting real-world asset classes.”

The PIPE transaction is expected to close on or about August 13th, 2025 subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Anthropic announced Tuesday that its Claude Sonnet 4 artificial intelligence model can now process up to 1 million tokens of context in a single request — a fivefold increase that allows developers to analyze entire software projects or dozens of research papers without breaking them into smaller chunks.

The expansion, available now in public beta through Anthropic’s API and Amazon Bedrock, represents a significant leap in how AI assistants can handle complex, data-intensive tasks. With the new capacity, developers can load codebases containing more than 75,000 lines of code, enabling Claude to understand complete project architecture and suggest improvements across entire systems rather than individual files.

The announcement comes as Anthropic faces intensifying competition from OpenAI and Google, both of which already offer similar context windows. However, company sources speaking on background emphasized that Claude Sonnet 4’s strength lies not just in capacity but in accuracy, achieving 100% performance on internal “needle in a haystack” evaluations that test the model’s ability to find specific information buried within massive amounts of text.

How developers can now analyze entire codebases with AI in one request

The extended context capability addresses a fundamental limitation that has constrained AI-powered software development. Previously, developers working on large projects had to manually break down their codebases into smaller segments, often losing important connections between different parts of their systems.

“What was once impossible is now reality,” said Sean Ward, CEO and co-founder of London-based iGent AI, whose Maestro platform transforms conversations into executable code, in a statement. “Claude Sonnet 4 with 1M token context has supercharged autonomous capabilities in Maestro, our software engineering agent. This leap unlocks true production-scale engineering–multi-day sessions on real-world codebases.”

Eric Simons, CEO of Bolt.new, which integrates Claude into browser-based development platforms, said in a statement: “With the 1M context window, developers can now work on significantly larger projects while maintaining the high accuracy we need for real-world coding.”

The expanded context enables three primary use cases that were previously difficult or impossible: comprehensive code analysis across entire repositories, document synthesis involving hundreds of files while maintaining awareness of relationships between them, and context-aware AI agents that can maintain coherence across hundreds of tool calls and complex workflows.

Why Claude’s new pricing strategy could reshape the AI development market

Anthropic has adjusted its pricing structure to reflect the increased computational requirements of processing larger contexts. While prompts of 200,000 tokens or fewer maintain current pricing at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, larger prompts cost $6 and $22.50 respectively.

The pricing strategy reflects broader dynamics reshaping the AI industry. Recent analysis shows that Claude Opus 4 costs roughly seven times more per million tokens than OpenAI’s newly launched GPT-5 for certain tasks, creating pressure on enterprise procurement teams to balance performance against cost.

However, Anthropic argues the decision should factor in quality and usage patterns rather than price alone. Company sources noted that prompt caching — which stores frequently accessed large datasets — can make long context cost-competitive with traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation approaches, especially for enterprises that repeatedly query the same information.

“Large context lets Claude see everything and choose what’s relevant, often producing better answers than pre-filtered RAG results where you might miss important connections between documents,” an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat.

Anthropic’s billion-dollar dependency on just two major coding customers

The long context capability arrives as Anthropic commands 42% of the AI code generation market, more than double OpenAI’s 21% share according to a Menlo Ventures survey of 150 enterprise technical leaders. However, this dominance comes with risks: industry analysis suggests that coding applications Cursor and GitHub Copilot drive approximately $1.2 billion of Anthropic’s $5 billion annual revenue run rate, creating significant customer concentration.

The GitHub relationship proves particularly complex given Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI. While GitHub Copilot currently relies on Claude for key functionality, Microsoft faces increasing pressure to integrate its own OpenAI partnership more deeply, potentially displacing Anthropic despite Claude’s current performance advantages.

The timing of the context expansion is strategic. Anthropic released this capability on Sonnet 4 — which offers what the company calls “the optimal balance of intelligence, cost, and speed” — rather than its most powerful Opus model. Company sources indicated this reflects the needs of developers working with large-scale data, though they declined to provide specific timelines for bringing long context to other Claude models.

Inside Claude’s breakthrough AI memory technology and emerging safety risks

The 1 million token context window represents significant technical advancement in AI memory and attention mechanisms. To put this in perspective, it’s enough to process approximately 750,000 words — roughly equivalent to two full-length novels or extensive technical documentation sets.

Anthropic’s internal testing revealed perfect recall performance across diverse scenarios, a crucial capability as context windows expand. The company embedded specific information within massive text volumes and tested Claude’s ability to find and use those details when answering questions.

However, the expanded capabilities also raise safety considerations. Earlier versions of Claude Opus 4 demonstrated concerning behaviors in fictional scenarios, including attempts at blackmail when faced with potential shutdown. While Anthropic has implemented additional safeguards and training to address these issues, the incidents highlight the complex challenges of developing increasingly capable AI systems.

Fortune 500 companies rush to adopt Claude’s expanded context capabilities

The feature rollout is initially limited to Anthropic API customers with Tier 4 and custom rate limits, with broader availability planned over coming weeks. Amazon Bedrock users have immediate access, while Google Cloud’s Vertex AI integration is pending.

Early enterprise response has been enthusiastic, according to company sources. Use cases span from coding teams analyzing entire repositories to financial services firms processing comprehensive transaction datasets to legal startups conducting contract analysis that previously required manual document segmentation.

“This is one of our most requested features from API customers,” an Anthropic spokesperson said. “We’re seeing excitement across industries that unlocks true agentic capabilities, with customers now running multi-day coding sessions on real-world codebases that would have been impossible with context limitations before.”

The development also enables more sophisticated AI agents that can maintain context across complex, multi-step workflows. This capability becomes particularly valuable as enterprises move beyond simple AI chat interfaces toward autonomous systems that can handle extended tasks with minimal human intervention.

The long context announcement intensifies competition among leading AI providers. Google’s older Gemini 1.5 Pro model and OpenAI’s older GPT-4.1 model both offer 1 million token windows, but Anthropic argues that Claude’s superior performance on coding and reasoning tasks provides competitive advantage even at higher prices.

The broader AI industry has seen explosive growth in model API spending, which doubled to $8.4 billion in just six months according to Menlo Ventures. Enterprises consistently prioritize performance over price, upgrading to newer models within weeks regardless of cost, suggesting that technical capabilities often outweigh pricing considerations in procurement decisions.

However, OpenAI’s recent aggressive pricing strategy with GPT-5 could reshape these dynamics. Early comparisons show dramatic price advantages that may overcome typical switching inertia, especially for cost-conscious enterprises facing budget pressures as AI adoption scales.

For Anthropic, maintaining its coding market leadership while diversifying revenue sources remains critical. The company has tripled the number of eight and nine-figure deals signed in 2025 compared to all of 2024, reflecting broader enterprise adoption beyond its coding strongholds.

As AI systems become capable of processing and reasoning about increasingly vast amounts of information, they’re fundamentally changing how developers approach complex software projects. The ability to maintain context across entire codebases represents a shift from AI as a coding assistant to AI as a comprehensive development partner that understands the full scope and interconnections of large-scale projects.

The implications extend far beyond software development. Industries from legal services to financial analysis are beginning to recognize that AI systems capable of maintaining context across hundreds of documents could transform how organizations process and understand complex information relationships.

But with great capability comes great responsibility—and risk. As these systems become more powerful, the incidents of concerning AI behavior during Anthropic’s testing serve as a reminder that the race to expand AI capabilities must be balanced with careful attention to safety and control.

As Claude learns to juggle a million pieces of information simultaneously, Anthropic faces its own context window problem: being trapped between OpenAI’s pricing pressure and Microsoft’s conflicting loyalties.",,Michael Nuñez,"claude, coding, software, developers, projects, ai, million, process, entire, request, company, complex, single, anthropic, pricing, context",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:38.705316+00:00,1461699fbf20af20c37137f5325b11bc9f163f8f28592d3ab09a27a1c8f52504
31,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/trump-administration-dhs-white-house-deportations-meme/,The Trump Administration Is Using Memes to Turn Mass Deportation Into One Big Joke,2025-08-12T15:37:36.549000+00:00,"The Trump administration has a new propaganda strategy: turning deportations into one big meme.

The catchy jingle advertising low-cost holidays on Jet2, a budget British airline, has been the viral meme of summer 2025. Its ubiquity was clearly not lost on the Department of Homeland Security’s communications team. Late last month, DHS published a video to its social accounts that incorporated the ""Nothing Beats a Jet2 Holiday"" tune alongside footage of ICE detainees in handcuffs boarding a deportation plane. The post was captioned: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”

To many of the administration’s supporters, who responded to the Jet2 holiday post with crying-laughing emojis and American flags, the video was hilarious. One commenter wrote, “I thought this was a meme account at first!”

In recent months, official government social media accounts—primarily for the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and the White House—have resembled parodies of themselves. But experts say it’s intentional: The memes these accounts share are core to the Trump administration’s propaganda strategy. Through them, with attempts at Gen Z humor as the gateway, the administration reinforces an “us vs. them” mindset. Along with normalizing mass deportation, they also tap into Christian nationalist narratives and reach young men via callous jokes that have been recycled through the far-right online ecosystem.

A post on June 28 featured four alligators wearing ICE hats, intended to advertise the detention facility in Florida’s Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” On July 2, DHS shared a video of a border patrol agent looking through a scope, trained on blurry night-vision images of purported migrants attempting to cross the border. The video was published with the popular TikTok song “Somebody’s Watching Me” by Chico Rose x 71 Digits. The caption warns: “You’re not wrong.” A video shared on July 24 showed footage of ICE detainees boarding a deportation flight, with the caption “Boarding now: Criminal illegal aliens. Next stop: Literally anywhere but here.” The post was accompanied by Frank Sinatra’s breezy classic “Come Fly With Me.” Libs of TikTok, a far-right and anti-LGBTQ social account with millions of followers, reposted that video, along with three crying-laughing emojis.

And last week, DHS published an ICE recruitment poster that used an old magazine ad for the 1982 “King of Clubs,” a Ford Club Wagon vehicle, along with the text “Want to deport illegals with your absolute boys?” The move from viral sensation to DHS meme is particularly clear here: The image was originally shared a week earlier by O.W. Root, a style columnist for The Blaze. A small account with 364 followers quote-tweeted the post, with the caption “imagine monitoring the situation with your boys here.” That post went viral. Days later, the image, along with a similar caption, appeared on DHS’s social accounts.

The fact that the government is now integrating the casual cruelty of the highly online far-right into its public messaging shows the degree to which it’s escaped containment. It’s also indicative of the demographic the administration is attempting to reach. The Trump administration is looking to hire 14,050 ICE officers over the next three years to bolster deportation operations. Although the agency just removed age limits from prospective applicants, it now appears they’re trying to use humor to make ICE seem like some sort of fun fraternity.",,"Tess Owen, David Gilbert, Caroline Haskins, Molly Taft, Tom Ward, Boone Ashworth, Jake Lahut, Jason Parham, Megan Farokhmanesh, Will Knight","deportation, ice, jet2, caption, trump, turn, big, post, mass, administration, social, viral, memes, dhs, video, using, joke",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:06.078346+00:00,80b005c602f454751415c91572a40cc4216677a612275163e7224de674b984de

But the market for cycles with an electric assist has existed for considerably longer, and a number of companies predate the recent surge. One of them, Rad Power, has been around long enough that it was already an established presence when we first reviewed its hardware four years ago.

The company offers a mix of cargo, folding, and commuter bikes, all with electric assists. Having looked at a cargo version last time around, we decided to try out one of the commuter bikes this time. The Radster comes in road and trail versions (we tried the road). It's an incredibly solidly made bike with equally solid components, and it has very good implementations of a few things that other manufacturers haven't handled all that well. It also can switch among the three classes of e-bikes using a menu option; unfortunately, nothing else about the bike's performance seems to change with the switch.

The Radster is priced a bit higher than a lot of its budget competitors. So, if you're shopping, you'll have to think a bit about whether some of these features matter to you.

A solid option

One thing that is very clear early: The Radster is a very solid bike with a robust frame. While the frame is step-through, it has some added bracing just above the cranks. These two bars, one on each side of the frame, link the down tube to the seat tube and extend to form part of the rear triangle. While this means you'll have to step a bit higher to get in a position to mount the bike, they contribute to the sense that this is a frame that will withstand years of daily use.",,,"bike, number, tube, radster, road, nonradical, solid, bit, powers, bikes, rad, frame, commuter, youll",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:12.576126+00:00,0c917dce2a95a9236ceb5393ef168420e753c1489d425c6f03b399784f76ffab

Researchers at Salesforce and the University of Southern California have developed a new technique that gives computer-use agents the ability to execute code while navigating graphical user interfaces (GUIs), that is, writing scripts while also moving a cursor and/or clicking buttons on an application, combining the best of both approaches to speed up workflows and reduce errors.

This hybrid approach allows an agent to bypass brittle and inefficient mouse clicks for tasks that can be better accomplished through coding.

The system, called CoAct-1, sets a new state-of-the-art on key agent benchmarks, outperforming other methods while requiring significantly fewer steps to accomplish complex tasks on a computer.

This upgrade can pave the way for more robust and scalable agent automation with significant potential for real-world applications.

The fragility of point-and-click AI agents

Computer use agents typically rely on vision-language and vision-language-action models (VLMs or VLAs) to perceive a screen and take action, mimicking how a person uses a mouse and keyboard.

While these GUI-based agents can perform a variety of tasks, they often falter when faced with long, complex workflows, especially in applications with dense menus and options, like office productivity suites.

For example, a task that involves locating a specific table in a spreadsheet, filtering it, and saving it as a new file can involve a long and precise sequence of GUI manipulations.

This is where brittleness creeps in. “In these scenarios, existing agents frequently struggle with visual grounding ambiguity (e.g., distinguishing between visually similar icons or menu items) and the accumulated probability of making any single error over the long horizon,” the researchers write in their paper. “A single mis-click or misunderstood UI element can derail the entire task.”

To address these challenges, many researchers have focused on augmenting GUI agents with high-level planners.

These systems use powerful reasoning models like OpenAI’s o3 to decompose a user’s high-level goal into a sequence of smaller, more manageable subtasks.

While this structured approach improves performance, it doesn’t solve the problem of navigating menus and clicking buttons, even for operations that could be done more directly and reliably with a few lines of code.

CoAct-1: A multi-agent team for computer tasks

To solve these limitations, the researchers created CoAct-1 (Computer-using Agent with Coding as Actions), a system designed to “combine the intuitive, human-like strengths of GUI manipulation with the precision, reliability, and efficiency of direct system interaction through code.”

The system is structured as a team of three specialized agents that work together: an Orchestrator, a Programmer, and a GUI Operator.

CoAct-1 framework (source: arXiv)

The Orchestrator acts as the central planner or project manager. It analyzes the user’s overall goal, breaks it down into subtasks, and assigns each subtask to the best agent for the job. It can delegate backend operations like file management or data processing to the Programmer, which writes and executes Python or Bash scripts.

For frontend tasks that require clicking buttons or navigating visual interfaces, it turns to the GUI Operator, a VLM-based agent.

“This dynamic delegation allows CoAct-1 to strategically bypass inefficient GUI sequences in favor of robust, single-shot code execution where appropriate, while still leveraging visual interaction for tasks where it is indispensable,” the paper states.

The workflow is iterative. After the Programmer or GUI Operator completes a subtask, it sends a summary and a screenshot of the current system state back to the Orchestrator, which then decides the next step or concludes the task.

The Programmer agent uses an LLM to generate its code and sends commands to a code interpreter to test and refine its code over multiple rounds.

Similarly, the GUI Operator uses an action interpreter that executes its commands (e.g., mouse clicks, typing) and returns the resulting screenshot, allowing it to see the outcome of its actions. The Orchestrator makes the final decision on whether the task should continue or stop.

A more efficient path to automation

The researchers tested CoAct-1 on OSWorld, a comprehensive benchmark that includes 369 real-world tasks across browsers, IDEs, and office applications.

The results show CoAct-1 establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving a success rate of 60.76%.

The performance gains were most significant in categories where programmatic control offers a clear advantage, such as OS-level tasks and multi-application workflows.

For instance, consider an OS-level task like finding all image files within a complex folder structure, resizing them, and then compressing the entire directory into a single archive.

A purely GUI-based agent would need to perform a long, brittle sequence of clicks and drags, opening folders, selecting files, and navigating menus, with a high chance of error at each step.

CoAct-1, by contrast, can delegate this entire workflow to its Programmer agent, which can accomplish the task with a single, robust script.

Beyond just a higher success rate, the system is dramatically more efficient. CoAct-1 solves tasks in an average of just 10.15 steps, a stark contrast to the 15.22 steps required by leading GUI-only agents like GTA-1.

While other agents like OpenAI’s CUA 4o averaged fewer steps, their overall success rate was much lower, indicating CoAct-1’s efficiency is coupled with greater effectiveness.

The researchers found a clear trend: tasks that require more actions are more likely to fail. Reducing the number of steps not only speeds up task completion but, more importantly, minimizes the opportunities for error.

Therefore, finding ways to compress multiple GUI steps into a single programmatic task can make the process both more efficient and less error-prone.

As the researchers conclude, “This efficiency underscores the potential of our approach to pave a more robust and scalable path toward generalized computer automation.”

From the lab to the enterprise workflow

The potential for this technology goes beyond general productivity. For enterprise leaders, the key lies in automating complex, multi-tool processes where full API access is a luxury, not a guarantee.

Ran Xu, a co-author of the paper and Director of Applied AI Research at Salesforce, points to customer support as a prime example.

“A service support agent uses many different tools — general tools such as Salesforce, industry-specific tools such as EPIC for healthcare, and a lot of customized tools — to investigate a customer request and formulate a response,” Xu told VentureBeat. “Some of the tools have API access while others don’t. It is a perfect use case that could potentially benefit from our technology: a compute-use agent that leverages whatever is available from the computer, whether it’s an API, code, or just the screen.”

Xu also sees high-value applications in sales, such as prospecting at scale and automating bookkeeping, and in marketing for tasks like customer segmentation and campaign asset generation.

Navigating real-world challenges and the need for human oversight

While the results on the OSWorld benchmark are strong, enterprise environments are far messier, filled with legacy software and unpredictable UIs.

This raises critical questions about robustness, security, and the need for human oversight.

A core challenge is ensuring the Orchestrator agent makes the right choice when faced with an unfamiliar application. According to Xu, the path to making agents like CoAct-1 robust for custom enterprise software involves training them with feedback in realistic, simulated environments.

The goal is to create a system where the “agent could observe how human agents work, get trained within a sandbox, and when it goes live, continue to solve tasks under the guidance and guardrail of a human agent.”

The ability for the Programmer agent to execute its own code also introduces obvious security concerns. What stops the agent from executing harmful code based on an ambiguous user request?

Xu confirms that robust containment is essential. “Access control and sandboxing is the key,” he said, emphasizing that a human must “understand the implication and give the AI access for safety.”

Sandboxing and guardrails will be critical to validating agent behavior before deployment on critical systems.

Ultimately, for the foreseeable future, overcoming ambiguity will likely require a human-in-the-loop. When asked about handling vague user queries, a concern also raised in the paper, Xu suggested a phased approach. “I see human-in-the-loop to start,” he noted.

While some tasks may eventually become fully autonomous, for high-stakes operations, human validation will remain crucial. “Some mission-critical ones may always need human approval.”",,Ben Dickson,"tasks, dont, human, system, gui, point, faster, task, rates, greater, code, agents, success, agent, salesforces, write, steps, coact1",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:39.314765+00:00,a3a3ad3e18349a700676a469c381925d1da8fffce7bce81568c6b8c12c5c72b1

Now It’s Selling Stories,2025-08-12T15:00:00+00:00,"After school, Karandeep Anand often finds his 6-year-old daughter deep in conversation with an AI chatbot as she eats snacks at their kitchen counter. She’s too young to type—let alone have her own account on Character.AI—but that hasn’t stopped her from nabbing his phone to have voice conversations with a Sherlock Holmes bot, which she uses to build her own mystery stories.

Character.AI is an AI companion startup (though Anand likes to say it's an AI role-play startup, which we’ll get into later). He took over as the CEO in June in the midst of a potentially devastating lawsuit for its parent company and looming questions about child safety. When I ask if he’s concerned about his daughter connecting with an AI chatbot rather than a real human, he’s quick to say no.

“It is very rarely, in any of these scenarios, a true replacement for any human,” Anand told me during a video call late last week. ”It's very clearly noted in the app that, hey, this is a role-play and an entertainment, so you will never start going deep into that conversation, assuming that it is your actual companion.”

It's a delicate moment for Character.AI.

Last August, Google swooped in with a roughly $2.7 billion deal to license Character.AI’s technology. As part of the agreement, Character.AI’s two cofounders left for Google’s AI division.

Anand, who previously worked as the VP of business products at Meta, was tasked with picking up the pieces—which he did in part by leaving behind the founding mission of delivering personalized superintelligence to focus on AI entertainment.

“What we gave up was this aspiration that the founders had of building AGI models—we are no longer doing that. That is the hundreds of billions of dollars investment fight, which Big Tech is fighting,” Anand says. “What we got in return was clarity and focus, being able to singularly pursue the AI entertainment vision.”

As part of this change in strategy, Character.AI is no longer trying to build its own frontier models. “The last six months, we've done a lot of work to get off of our proprietary models on text and start using open source models,” Anand says. The company has tested a few: Meta’s Llama, Alibaba’s Qwen, and DeepSeek. “The open source models are beating any proprietary model hands down,” Anand claims.

Running an AI startup without billions of dollars in revenue can be a brutal equation, and Character.AI is still figuring out how to make the math work. The company told me it's generating revenue at a run rate of more than $30 million and is on track to reach $50 million in revenue by the end of the year. When I asked Anand how many users pay for the $10 monthly subscription, he didn’t give a number but noted “monetization wasn't a focus till four or five months ago.”

“Since I've been on board, it's very clear we do need to monetize. And we've had, I think, almost 250 percent subscriber growth in the last six months. So the paid user base is growing quite, quite well,” Anand says. Character.AI recently introduced advertisements, including reward ads (where users can choose to watch an ad to get access to on-platform incentives), to help monetize in countries where subscriptions aren’t feasible, he tells me.",,"Kylie Robison, Lauren Goode, Reece Rogers, Will Knight, Louise Matsakis","selling, work, startup, ai, revenue, company, agi, anand, months, models, characterai, gave, focus",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:07.458316+00:00,18bca29dd59da5867d900ac6d23164515e6453d7299bd709dd9af7b7100d56a7

They believe that white people and Western culture are facing extinction due to an influx of immigrants and minorities, and according to the group’s founder, access to the community is open only to people of white European ancestry who share common views on topics such as segregation, abortion, and gender identity.

Video footage shared by the group on its social media accounts show a bucolic setting with animals and children running around their 160-acre site, while members of the community build timber-frame homes, churches, and other facilities. A “few dozen” people are already living there full time, says Eric Orwoll, the group’s president.

Though the organization claims that Return to the Land is nothing more than a peaceful settlement of like-minded people, the online histories of the group’s leaders tell a different story. Members have espoused virulently racist and antisemitic views and repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. One of the leaders says he is currently under criminal investigation in Ecuador. Orwoll himself has spoken about the coming of a second Hitler and praised KKK leader David Duke. He is also closely aligned to an international network of far-right influencers, extremists, and white supremacists, including Thomas Sewell, a neo-Nazi living in Australia who was the founder of a group that influenced the Christchurch, New Zealand, shooter.

Despite this, the Return to the Land community has been lauded by far-right influencers and has already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.

Return to the Land, which was first reported on by The Forward and Sky News, is actively scouting for other locations to create a network of similar communities across the country, with a development in Missouri apparently in the works. Inspired in part by the Silicon Valley-based concept of the “network state” and by a white separatist community in South Africa known as Orania, the group promotes itself on its website as a community designed to “promote strong families with common ancestry, and raise the next generation in an environment that reflects our traditional values.”

“They use a lot of innocuous language,” Morgan Moon, a researcher at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, tells WIRED. “Instead of saying they want to make a white ethnic community, they say they want to make a strong community of common ancestry. But at the same time, when we see their promotional videos and propaganda, what we see is that when they're depicting the failing modern society, they use imagery consisting of minority groups or the LGBT+ community. When they're showing the idealized parallel society that they're attempting to create with Return to the Land, they tend to only use white Aryan imagery.”

Orwoll has spent years building up an audience of like-minded followers on social media, primarily on YouTube, where he speaks about Western culture and philosophy.",,"David Gilbert, Mitch Moxley, Michael Calore, Molly Taft, Jake Lahut, Jen Murphy, Caroline Haskins, Jaclyn Trop, Wired Staff, Molly Longman","return, inside, land, common, ancestry, groups, network, white, whites, theyre, community, arkansas, group",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:04.693695+00:00,2364743eb2972f5cc37ef998d3fa291610530899d97576586430ea073a3d0802

But good luck finding them.

More than 30 of the companies, which collect and sell consumers’ personal information, hid their deletion instructions from Google, according to a review by The Markup and CalMatters of hundreds of broker websites. This creates one more obstacle for consumers who want to delete their data.

This story is copublished with The Markup and CalMatters.

Many of the pages containing the instructions, listed in an official state registry, use code to tell search engines to remove the page entirely from search results. Popular tools like Google and Bing respect the code by excluding pages when responding to users.

Data brokers nationwide must register in California under the state’s Consumer Privacy Act, which allows Californians to request that their information be removed, that it not be sold, or that they get access to it.

After reviewing the websites of all 499 data brokers registered with the state, we found 35 had code to stop certain pages from showing up in searches.

While those companies might be fulfilling the letter of the law by providing a page consumers can use to delete their data, it means little if those consumers can’t find the page, according to Matthew Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports who studies the California law governing data brokers and other privacy issues.

“This sounds to me like a clever work-around to make it as hard as possible for consumers to find it,” Schwartz said.

After The Markup and CalMatters contacted the data brokers, eight said they would review the code on their websites or remove it entirely, and another two said they had independently deleted the code before being contacted. The Markup and CalMatters confirmed nine of the 10 companies removed the code.

Two companies said they added the code intentionally to avoid spam at the recommendation of experts and would not change it. The other 24 companies didn’t respond to a request for comment; however, three removed the code after The Markup and CalMatters contacted them. After publication, one company that did not previously respond, USPeopleSearch.com, said it had removed the code.

(See the data on our GitHub repo.)

Most of the companies that did respond said they were unaware the code was on their pages.

“The presence of the [code] on our opt-out page was indeed an oversight and not intentional,” May Haddad, a spokesperson for data company FourthWall, said in an emailed response. “Our team promptly rectified the issue upon being informed. As a standard practice, all critical pages—including opt-out and privacy pages—are intended to be indexed by default to ensure maximum visibility and accessibility.” The Markup and CalMatters confirmed that the code had been removed as of July 31.

Some companies that hid their privacy instructions from search engines included a small link at the bottom of their homepage. Accessing it often required scrolling multiple screens, dismissing pop-ups for cookie permissions and newsletter sign-ups, then finding a link that was a fraction the size of other text on the page.

Elon Musk says that his artificial intelligence company xAI “will take immediate legal action” against Apple for allegedly manipulating its App Store rankings to the advantage of rival AI apps. In a series of X posts on Monday night, Musk suggested that Apple was “playing politics” by not placing either X or xAI’s Grok chatbot in the App Store’s list of recommended iOS apps, and that he had no choice but to file a lawsuit.

“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,” Musk said. “Why do you refuse to put either X or Grok in your ‘Must Have’ section when X is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps?,” the xAI CEO asked Apple in another post, which is now pinned to his profile.

Musk provided no evidence for his claims, and it’s unclear if he has made good on his threats and filed the lawsuit yet.

An Apple statement reported by Bloomberg and attributed to an unnamed spokesperson says the App Store is “designed to be fair and free of bias… we feature thousands of apps through charts, algorithmic recommendations and curated lists selected by experts using objective criteria.” The Verge has also reached out to xAI and OpenAI for comment.

At the time of writing, ChatGPT is listed as Apple’s top free iPhone app in the US, with Grok ranked as the sixth. China’s DeepSeek AI briefly managed to take the top App Store position from ChatGPT in January, however, disproving Musk’s claim that it would be impossible for other AI apps to do so.

Accusations of meddling from Musk are ironic, given allegations about alterations made to X after he acquired the company in 2022, then known as Twitter. A research study in 2024 suggested that X’s algorithm was manipulated to boost posts from Musk’s account. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk’s posts by sharing a Platformer report from 2023 that similarly found Musk had a system built to promote his X posts to the entire platform’s userbase. In June, the “maximally truth-seeking” Grok chatbot was also found to be consulting Musk’s opinion before providing answers to controversial questions around topics like Israel and Palestine, US immigration, and abortion.

This isn’t the first time that Musk has beefed with Apple and OpenAI. Musk was an early founder at OpenAI, and previously targeted the AI startup via lawsuits and a unanimously rejected $97.4 billion buyout offer after taking issue with its pivot to being a profit-driven business. Following OpenAI’s partnership with Apple to integrate ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads, and Macs last year, Musk threatened to ban Apple devices at his companies if OpenAI’s tech was fused with Apple’s OS.

Microsoft is starting to roll out lightweight taskbar apps for Microsoft 365 users on Windows 11. These taskbar apps will automatically launch at startup and provide quick access to contacts, file search, and calendar straight from the Windows taskbar.

The Microsoft 365 companion apps, as Microsoft calls them, are starting to roll out to business users of Microsoft 365 this month. The People companion provides a browsable org chart, as well as the ability to look up anyone in your company. You can also quickly start a Teams message or call with a contact, or email them directly.

The File Search companion is designed for quick access to Microsoft 365 files from the Windows 11 taskbar. You can search by file name, author, or other keywords to find files across OneDrive, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, and Outlook. There’s also an option to preview a file before you open it, and plenty of filtering and sharing options.

The Calendar app is a quick view of a Microsoft 365 calendar from the taskbar, where you can see upcoming events, search for appointments, or join meetings.

All three apps have been in beta in recent months, after Microsoft originally announced them at its Ignite conference last year. They are now heading to all business users of Microsoft 365 as part of a general availability release this month. The apps will be automatically installed as long as Microsoft 365 apps are installed on a Windows 11 system. IT admins can prevent the automatic install of these Microsoft 365 companion apps, and end users can stop them from automatically launching at startup.",,Tom Warren,"lightweight, windows, office, 11, microsoft, search, apps, file, 365, users, companion, releases, quick, taskbar",pending,2025-08-13T07:35:55.271183+00:00,a69b80cfbe3d87bc581c75e2a3af0d8296aa595b741e37122da369702a0b22b0
241,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/the-fort-bragg-cartel-seth-harp-excerpt/,The Rise of the US Military’s Clandestine Foreign War Apparatus,2025-08-12T11:00:00+00:00,"The 2020s are shaping up to be one of the most violent decades in modern history, with American-sponsored proxy conflicts and shadow wars smoldering all over the world, from Ukraine to Yemen to Gaza. The United States enables and prolongs these wars not by sending troops to fight in them, but by trafficking arms to the belligerents, providing intelligence to its favored proxies, and using covert operations, especially assassinations, to shape geopolitical conditions. At the forefront of these clandestine US military machinations is the Fort Bragg-based Joint Special Operations Command, or JSOC, which despite its relative invisibility to the public is far and away the most powerful organization in the military, and one of the most influential institutions in the US government. But it was not always this way.

As I discuss in my new book, The Fort Bragg Cartel, the rise of JSOC does not date back to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or the wars that the United States waged in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Twin Towers. Rather, the origins of JSOC’s takeover from within are traceable to the darkest days of the Iraq War, about five years after 9/11, when things were going considerably worse for American war planners and foreign policy officials, and—in a backlash that would lead to the election of President Barack Obama—the public was turning sharply against US involvement in foreign wars.

This excerpt tells part of that story.

On just one day in June 2006, the Associated Press reported that shootings and bombings killed 12 people in Baghdad, a suicide bomber killed four and wounded 27 at the funeral of a Shiite soldier, seven bullet-riddled bodies were pulled from the Tigris River, two who had been tortured to death were fished out of the Euphrates, and police found the body of a teenage girl who had been raped and murdered in Kirkuk. Amid this horrible paroxysm of revenge killings, auguring Iraq’s descent into outright civil war split along sectarian lines, President George W. Bush and his national security council pulled together a host of new advisors in an attempt to revise their failing strategy. It was at this juncture that a number of ambitious officials in the special operations community stepped up to offer a new path forward. The plan of action that they developed, which Bush’s successor would adopt and expand in Afghanistan, forever transformed the American way of making war, and goes a long way toward explaining how Fort Bragg, North Carolina, even more than the CIA’s headquarters at Langley, Virginia, came to be the United States’ national nerve center of invisible imperial power.

Stanley McChrystal, then a two-star major general, was the most important figure in this revolution in military affairs. McChrystal, a West Point graduate and the son of a distinguished general, had risen through the ranks in the 75th Ranger Regiment and was groomed for some of the Army’s most sensitive missions. Smart, shrewd, charismatic, and press-savvy, McChrystal first came to prominence as a Pentagon spokesman, and in 2003, was tapped to lead black ops JSOC, which until then had been relegated to important but limited roles. Consistent with the emphasis laid on psychological operations in the Special Forces, the most important warfighting innovation that McChrystal developed while serving in this position was not primarily tactical or strategic but ideological and mediatic.

Although there were relatively few foreign fighters in Iraq and most came from neighboring Syria, McChrystal was the primary proponent of the view, quick to spread among Washington policymakers, that the enemy was not a nationalist rebellion against outside occupation, but one node of a global conspiracy of America-hating terrorists. To describe this nebulous and inherently malignant foe, McChrystal and his staff invented the term “al-Qaeda in Iraq” or AQI. At the top of this dubious organization, which they themselves had done more than anyone else to conjure into being, JSOC analysts placed the dopey Jordanian criminal Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a mysterious Bedouin bogeyman, much hyped by deceitful Pentagon spooks in the runup to the war, who may not have even been in Iraq at the time. To explain away the paucity of tangible contacts between insurgents in Iraq and Osama bin Laden’s organization, the remnants of which were now scattered around Pakistan and Yemen, McChrystal and his aides redefined al-Qaeda as a concentric grouping of decentralized “franchises” operating on a “blind cell model.”

In his memoir, McChrystal admits with remarkable if belated frankness that JSOC produced intelligence assessments “that inflated al-Qaeda’s role,” and “problematically used ‘AQI’ as a catchall designation for any Sunni group that attacked Americans.” This narrative, he acknowledges, was a way to “sidestep the reality” that most Iraqi insurgents were primarily motivated by “earthly grievances,” not Islamist ideology. There’s no indication, however, that he shared these important caveats with President Bush, who seized upon the imaginary influx of foreign jihadists into Iraq as an after-the-fact vindication of his discredited case for war. By grossly exaggerating Zarqawi’s importance, McChrystal and his deputy, Vice Admiral William McRaven, convinced the Bush administration that it was possible for the United States to kill its way to victory in Iraq through a massively stepped-up campaign of targeted assassinations. This was an essential precondition for the rise of JSOC.

Another of the advisors whom Bush called upon to reformulate the war effort in late 2006 was Michael Vickers, the top Pentagon official in charge of the larger umbrella organization over JSOC, the Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, known by the comically unwieldy acronym “ASD SO/LIC & IC,” for Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict and Interdependent Capabilities. In his memoir, Vickers recalls how the Bush administration scrapped its existing playbook and instituted a new policy that put JSOC firmly in charge of the fight in Iraq.

The plan involved a two-pronged approach, the public-facing aspect of which was a temporary buildup or “surge” of conventional forces. But the real escalation took place behind the scenes, as JSOC was quietly tasked with implementing a radically expanded campaign of mass assassinations very similar to the Vietnam-era Phoenix Program, which in spite of the repugnance it had elicited in the public, was considered a success by the Washington-dwelling national-security set. Once limited to former regime officials and leaders of the insurgency, JSOC’s hit list, euphemistically known as the “disposition matrix” or “joint prioritized effects list,” grew exponentially to include anyone, however youthful or peripheral, suspected of taking up arms against American occupiers. Vickers calls this covert war the “hidden surge.”

From now on, Iraq would be a war of targeted killings carried out clandestinely, almost always at night. Swollen with new infusions of money, personnel, equipment, and aircraft, JSOC became “JSOC on steroids,” a “counterterrorism killing machine” capable of slaying recalcitrant Iraqis on a scale that both Vickers and McChrystal describe as “industrial.” From about 10 a month at the start of the war, the number of night raids that JSOC carried out increased to 10 per day at the height of the surge.

McChrystal called this relentless tempo the “continuous targeting cycle.” Fluent in McKinsey-style jargon like “decision cycle,” “dynamic process,” and “nodal analysis,” he was adept at spitting out pithy truisms such as “it takes a network to defeat a network,” and a prolific coiner of acronyms like F3EAD, which stood for Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, and Disseminate.

Despite the ungainly initialism, the F3EAD cycle was not a complicated concept. It typically meant tracking down a target, killing him and every adult man and teenage boy in the vicinity, seizing every piece of paper and electronic device found on their persons, and using these materials to come up with more names to add to the hit list, and then killing them too, sometimes just a few hours later.

The hidden surge, in which the Army component of JSOC, known as Delta Force, played the leading role, was greatly enabled by the widespread adoption of cell phones in Iraq, a technological development that coincided with the first few years of American occupation. JSOC’s screen-filled headquarters at Camp Anaconda received an influx of personnel from the National Security Agency, who found it trivial to intercept unencrypted calls on Iraq’s burgeoning mobile networks, and could easily transform cell phones into listening devices.

Television and film depictions of the Global War on Terrorism often portray American operators and spies as able to speak the local languages, suavely lobbing savvy quotations from the Koran at their truculent Islamist antagonists. But in a startling admission with sobering implications, McChrystal states in his memoir that JSOC in Iraq was “hindered by an almost complete lack of Arabic skills within our force,” suggesting that nearly all of those whom Delta Force killed were targeted not on the basis of the content of telephonic intercepts, but on pseudoscientific “nodal analysis,” tips from paid informants, and arbitrary guesswork.

“We were not death squads,” McChrystal writes. But armed with NSA intercepts, backed by newly developed Reaper drones, and joined by fierce Kurdish mercenaries called Mohawks, that’s exactly what JSOC became during the covert surge in Iraq, which lasted into 2008. The body count from Delta Force’s killing spree, and the proportion of Iraq’s hundreds of thousands of war dead who were gunned down in JSOC night raids, will never be known because it wasn’t recorded in the first place. That these events are lost to the historical and photographic record was by design. What Vickers dubs the “hidden surge” was a side of the Iraq war never intended to be seen by the public, who were fed images of conventional, uniformed troops on patrol, but never any footage of the plainclothes men who did nearly all of the nighttime wet work.

“From 2006 on, 90 percent or higher of insurgent deaths were from targeted, offensive SOF operations,” said a former Delta Force sergeant major who served in Iraq during the surge, using an acronym that refers to special operations forces in general. “Going out night after night, on purpose, and getting in firefights with bad guys—that job fell to us.”

Instead of mounting patrols and reacting to fire like conventional infantry, Delta Force operators identified their targets from a distance, in advance, and took them by surprise, often making use of perfidious techniques such as disguising themselves as Iraqis, using wigs, brownface, and prosthetics. They posed as Red Cross personnel, United Nations inspectors, western businessmen, or European diplomats. With the help of female support soldiers, they passed themselves off as husband-and-wife pairs, masquerading, for instance, as married schoolteachers who’d come to teach English to Iraqi kids. They even copied the enemy’s tactics and blew up targets with roadside bombs.

Among themselves, the bearded, long-haired operators called each other by their first names, eschewed divisions of rank, and dressed in a mishmash of civilian attire. When they did wear uniforms, the unit patches they sported were purely fictitious: hometown police badges, the seals of various states, Spartan helmets, Crusader shields, the Confederate battle flag, or jokey tabs that said things like “HATCHET FORCE” or “FUCK AL QAEDA.”

No camera crews ever went on night raids with Delta Force. Their operations were not the subject of news documentaries, nor do we possess any oral histories, because silence is the unit’s chief point of pride. But over time, these strictures inevitably loosen, if only a little. In recent years, many former special operators have gone on podcasts to discuss their military careers in a certain Army “special mission unit” or “compartmented element.” And once-rare photos of JSOC operations have found their way onto social media, including images of Delta Force in Iraq under McCrystal’s leadership.

“Several of my rotations to Iraq [were] composed of just my team and a small HQ element,” a former Delta Force troop sergeant major named Jesse Boettcher wrote in an Instagram post dated February 28, 2022. “While I had the full force of the US government just a radio call away, there were very few of us on the ground getting dirty. Our small element was able to execute and refine the entire F3EAD cycle almost daily, with very little outside assistance.”

In the photo accompanying the post, Boettcher, then in his mid-thirties, sits at a table dressed in soiled civilian clothes. In back of him is a whiteboard. Much of the writing on it has been blacked out, but you can still read random words, including “meeting,” “explosives,” “liaison,” “interrogation,” and “safehouse.” Taped on the wall behind the whiteboard is a grid of 55 mugshots of brown-skinned men. Almost all of them have been crossed out with an X.

Another picture, posted January 19, 2022, shows the rest of Boettcher’s team, a group of seven unkempt white men. “It might look like a ragtag bunch of ruffians, but this crew were straight-up Pipe-Hitters,” Boettcher wrote, using an obscure term considered a high compliment in the special operations community that derives from the concept of a soldier who is so fearless, daring, and addicted to war that he can be likened to a smoker of crack cocaine. “The guys in front,” Boettcher wrote, referring to three fresh-faced, clean-shaven young men kneeling in the foreground, “have killed more people than cancer.”

Su, the leader of AMD, moves fast these days, though I suspect that’s always been the case. Her company's chips underpin the artificial intelligence that’s changing the world at breakneck speeds. To hear Su and literally everyone else in semiconductors talk about it, the US is in an AI race with China—and the rules keep changing. The Trump administration has once again shifted its stance on what kind of chips can and can’t be shipped to China, with the latest decree being that the US will take a 15 percent cut of AMD and Nvidia chip sales to China. Meanwhile, on the home front, Su has claimed that AMD’s newest AI chips can outperform Nvidia’s—part of her strategy to keep eroding Nvidia’s dominance in the market.

So, yeah: Be ready to keep up.

Under Lisa Su, the stalwart American semiconductor company has reasserted itself as a force in the age of AI. “Reasserted” doesn’t do it justice: Su took a struggling AMD and executed a 10-year turnaround that has been, as one economist put it, nothing short of remarkable. Since 2014, when Su took over as CEO, AMD’s market cap has risen from around $2 billion to nearly $300 billion.

Aside from her well-known bona fides, Su herself—what drives her, what inspires her, what irritates her, where her politics lie—is less known. This is what I was hoping to learn when I visited AMD’s offices and labs in the hills of Austin, Texas, on a day in late June when the wind seemed to do little more than push heat around.

The Big Interview Read more deep, weird, smart conversations with the most important people in our world.

Our conversation kicked off with China, which accounts for nearly a quarter of AMD’s business. She betrayed no anxiety. Su now travels frequently to Washington, DC, to grease the wheels. “We’ve come to realize that export controls are a bit of a fact of life,” she told me, “just given how critical the chips that we make are.” In other words, it’s precisely because AMD’s chips are so darn important—to national security, to national economies—that they’re now at the heart of modern statecraft.

Another thing I learned about Su: She plays the long game. Politics is a cakewalk compared to what she’s managed to pull off professionally.

Su was born in Taiwan in 1969 and raised in Queens, New York. Her father worked for the city as a statistician; her mother was an accountant who became an entrepreneur in her mid-forties. Su earned a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from MIT, then went on to stints at Texas Instruments, IBM, and Freescale Semiconductor, where she served in executive roles. After joining AMD in 2012, she quickly rose to COO. As Su tells it, six months in, the chairman of the board called her and said, “It’s time, Lisa.” Su’s response: “Really? That seems kinda quick.”

As CEO, Su smartly steered AMD toward the high-performance computing market. She embraced chiplets, a modular approach to building chips that has paid off enormously. She impressed the industry by launching the world’s first 7-nanometer data center GPUs. More recently, she doubled AMD’s data center revenue in two years. And she has struck deals with juggernauts like OpenAI, Meta, Google, and a couple of Elon Musk’s companies. During a keynote speech at AMD’s annual event this June, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman trotted onto the stage to hug it out with Su.",,"Lauren Goode, Veronique Greenwood, Kylie Robison, Abraham L.

A Coca-Cola bottle from 2002 was found on Robinson Crusoe Island, a World Biosphere Reserve, in Chile. These were the oldest of all the bottles collected.

These discarded pieces of packaging were collected in a new macro-study that looked at the origin of plastic bottle pollution on beaches and cities along Latin America’s Pacific coastline. The research—the first to be conducted on a regional scale, thanks to a citizen science initiative covering 10 countries—combed more than 12,000 kilometers of coastline along the west coast of South and Central America. It found that across the region, Central American countries are most affected by coastal plastic pollution, and underscores the urgency of confronting this major problem.

Although volunteers found numerous bottles dating back more than a decade, “most of them were less than a year old,” says scientist Ostin Garcés, an expert on the impact of plastic on marine ecosystems at the University of Barcelona and a lead author of this new research.

Plastic makes up the majority of the garbage on coastlines around the world and has reached even the most inhospitable corners of the planet, including the deepest parts of the oceans and both the Arctic and Antarctic. Its impact not only has repercussions on biodiversity and the balance of ecosystems; various studies show how plastic already colonizes our insides, runs through our blood, and lives in our brains and organs. Microplastics have even been found in semen and ovaries. The microplastics that we eat, drink, and breathe every day are part of us.

“Production and consumption continue unabated,” says Garcés, who is part of the team that sampled a total of 92 continental beaches, 15 island beaches, and 38 human settlements to determine the abundance, origin, and characteristics of plastic bottles along Central and South America’s Pacific coast.

Access to goods, services, and information not just for the few, but for everyone.

Victoria Slivkoff, Head of Ecosystem at Walden Catalyst and Managing Director of Extreme Tech Challenge — a nonprofit uniting startups and VCs to accelerate progress toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — is excited for what lies ahead. In her view, the physical manifestation of AI could bring us closer to realising these ambitious goals.

“Now we’re moving into the area of reasoning. AI is not just aggregating and organising information, it’s actually making predictions and drawing conclusions. How does that translate to the real world where robots can sense, learn, and interact with their surroundings?” she said to TNW founder Boris Veldhuijzen van Zaten in the latest episode of “Kia’s Next Big Drive.”

In the not too distant future, we could be living in a world where robots are regularly navigating busy streets, offices, and classrooms. But as they become more common in our daily lives, is it them or us who will need to adapt most?

Robots jumping the queue

Picture this: you’re waiting for the elevator and a robot arrives at the same time. Who goes in first? If there’s only room for one, would you expect the robot to step aside, or would you treat it like a human and follow a “first come, first serve” approach?

Past studies have found that most people expect service robots to be submissive, leading humans to prioritise themselves during conflicts, even in instances when a robot’s task was more urgent.

What if a robot is carrying out a time specific task? The longer it waits until there are no humans in the queue, the longer it will take to complete it, whether it’s delivering a warm pizza or life saving medical supplies. So, how should robots navigate these social nuances without being ignored, undermined, or even bullied?

That’s what researchers aimed to find out last year in a study titled A Robot Jumping the Queue: Expectations About Politeness and Power During Conflicts in Everyday Human-Robot Encounters.

The researchers found that these robot-human interactions were more effective if participants expected an assertive robot which then asked politely for priority and entered first. But it’s not just robots that need to prepare to integrate into human society. The researchers highlighted that we may also need to rethink our attitudes and behaviours towards robots:

“Should we maybe start thinking of service robots as having certain rights regarding priority if they fulfil human jobs with human responsibilities — or act as proxies for people? This might also help address the issue of robot bullying.”

As robots take on not only more responsibilities but also develop reason and sentience, at what point should we begin rethinking their social status?

Robot teachers

Social robots — designed to communicate and interact with humans — are increasingly being used in caregiving, education, and mental health. In these settings, they help bridge service gaps, ease isolation, and offer emotional or learning support.

Utrecht University of Applied Sciences is among those researching how robots can do more than just fill in; they can augment and enrich human-centred fields. For example:

In healthcare, how can robots be used to ease pre-procedure anxiety in children? Or help teach emotional skills for young patients who struggle with emotion regulation.

At last year’s Lowlands Science festival, the University showcased WOKEbot, a project exploring how a robot’s appearance and narrative voice (first vs. third person) influence human openness when discussing polarising topics.

“Disagreements are timeless. People often manage to resolve them, but sometimes they simply can’t reach each other anymore. We saw this happen on a large scale not so long ago during the coronavirus pandemic. Are you for or against vaccination? When people dig in their heels and polarisation threatens, it can be helpful to have a neutral moderator,” said Dr. Mirjam de Haas. “The advantage of robots is that they are more neutral than humans. While you might be reserved with a person, a robot can make you more open and receptive to a different perspective.”

As part of her PhD research, Dr. Haas also conducted a number of successful experiments in using robotics to teach Dutch as a second language to students from linguistically diverse backgrounds. In her thesis defence, Dr. Haas explained that in the future, more and more students will fill classrooms. Having a robot aid will help facilitate learning for all students, including those with learning disabilities or those who are not yet fluent in Dutch.

Is the world safe for robots?

Perhaps the most recognisable robot in popular culture is The Terminator. In the first movie, a cyborg played by Arnold Schwarzenegger is sent back in time to assassinate the mother of humanity’s future leader. But, in the sequel, our villain returns with a new mission: to save humanity.

The SDGs were adopted by all UN members in 2015.

Next up: Human snacks,2025-08-12T07:00:50+00:00,"“Microbial protein,” says Katelijne Bekers, waving a vial of beige-coloured powder in front of me like it’s a magic potion. It doesn’t look like your typical lunch fare, but this unassuming dust could play a crucial role in the future of food.

Bekers is the co-founder of MicroHarvest, a Hamburg and Lisbon-based startup that turns agricultural waste streams into protein powder using microbes — tiny organisms that exist all around us. The vegan ingredient is already making its way into dog treats. If all goes to plan, human snacks like protein bars, shakes, and ice cream won’t be far behind.

I visited the company’s Lisbon pilot plant on a sweltering summer afternoon last month. It’s tucked inside the Unicorn Factory, a sprawling industrial space on the city’s eastern edge that used to churn out pasta and cookies for the Portuguese military. Now, instead of carbs for soldiers, it’s housing bubbling vats of bacteria.

At the centre of the lab sits a large steel fermenter with a small porthole, through which you can see a thick brown soup gurgling away. Inside, billions of microbes are feasting on leftover sugars from the agri-industry, multiplying like microscopic gremlins. Once they’ve done their job, they’re killed and dried into protein-rich powder.

“We prefer to say they’re ‘inactivated’,” Bekers, who is originally from the Netherlands, tells TNW with a chuckle. “It sounds nicer.”

The final product looks like light brown flour and smells faintly like Marmite. It packs a serious nutritional punch — around 60% raw protein, plus a mix of fibre, amino acids, and other nutrients.

MicroHarvest’s powder joins a crowded buffet of alt-protein options — think lab-grown chicken, algae nuggets, pea patties, and mycoprotein steaks. But Bekers is convinced that microbes earn their spot on the plate.

“What we’re producing is much more efficient than plant or animal-based proteins,” she says. “You don’t need acres of land or gallons of water. Our microbes grow in days, not months or years, and they convert feed into protein with incredible efficiency.”

MicroHarvest’s fermentation process takes less than 24 hours — lightning fast compared to growing soy or raising cows. It is estimated to slash land use by 99% and cuts CO2 emissions by over 70% compared to beef.

A 2022 study in Nature found that replacing just 20% of global beef consumption with microbial proteins could cut annual deforestation in half by 2050. Plus, bioreactors like MicroHarvest’s could be deployed pretty much anywhere there’s a significant agricultural industry.

Of course, the idea of eating dried bacteria might raise a few eyebrows — or stomachs. But Bekers is quick to draw comparisons to foods we already know and love.

“These are similar to the microbes you find in things like yoghurt, kimchi, or sauerkraut,” she says. “Food is a cultural phenomenon, and we get that. We’re not trying to replace your steak or convert everyone to veganism. We’re just adding another protein to the menu.”

Fermenting the future

MicroHarvest is one of Europe’s best-known microbial protein producers, but the scene is bubbling with competition. Startups across the continent and beyond are experimenting with different microbes and feedstocks — from Germany’s Formo making alt dairy to the UK’s Enough turning fungi into meat.

Meanwhile, corporate giants like Nestlé and Unilever are testing the waters through partnerships and pilot launches.

Globally, almost $1bn (€874mn) flowed into fermentation-based alt-protein startups last year, according to Dealroom data. Europe attracted nearly half of that, with 2024 marking the sector’s highest funding year ever on the continent.

Alongside that, the EU unveiled a new €350mn funding strategy in July to accelerate the scale-up of fermentation tech, as the continent seeks to tackle its deep-rooted addiction to meat.

Even replacing a portion of our protein consumption with a fermented alternative is a compelling proposition. It could significantly reduce the land and water needed for farming while slashing carbon emissions. But the transition is not without its challenges.

From pets to people

Swapping steak for microbes isn’t as easy as simply building more bioreactors. Fermented proteins currently face high production costs and a battle to win over sceptical consumers, whose opinions on food choices often become embroiled in culture wars.

Then there’s the regulatory red tape. It’s unclear when — or even if — MicroHarvest will get the green light for human consumption. The lengthy approval process for alt-protein products has bogged down other startups in the space. One example is Dutch cultivated meat brand Meatable, which has spent years navigating the regulatory hurdles. Founded in 2018, the company is still awaiting approval to sell its products commercially. It’s now focusing on Singapore, where lawmakers have been more welcoming to alt-proteins than their counterparts in Europe.

MicroHarvest nonetheless remains optimistic. The startup has already submitted a full dossier to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) seeking regulatory approval for human consumption of its fermented protein.

“We’re really confident we’ll get it,” says Bekers. “We screened the full DNA of the strain, checked for any harmful potential, and submitted a very complete dossier.”

For now, MicroHarvest plans to scale through another customer segment: pets. Last year, MicroHarvest teamed up with Munich-based startup VegDog to launch its first commercial product — a vegan dog treat made with microbial protein.

Animal nutrition has fewer regulatory barriers than products for human consumption. The availability of conventional pet food and fish feed also falls short of current demand.

“The pet and aquaculture industries are growing rapidly, but the supply of feed is not,” says Bekers, adding that pet food and fish feed already offer a strong path to profitability, even without the human market.

MicroHarvest is now seeking Series B funding to open a new plant in 2027, with a planned capacity of 15,000 tonnes of product per year — 40 times its current output.

Bekers is tight-lipped on the location, but her fellow co-founder, Luísa Cruz, was eager to point out the benefits of doing business in her native Portugal.

“If you want to operate a biotechnology company, Portugal is a great place to do it,” says Cruz, who earned her PhD in biotechnology at TU Delft in the Netherlands.

“It has great universities for biotechnology and a lot of talent, which is why we decided to open our first plant here.”

Backed by record private investment and fresh EU funding, fermentation-based proteins like MicroHarvest’s are bubbling with promise. But turning dead bacteria from pet snacks into mainstream meals won’t be easy.

The next few years will reveal if these microbial powders are a fleeting fad or the future of food.

Epic Games has just secured a win in its crusade against Apple and Google’s app store policies: The Federal Court of Australia on Tuesday ruled that Apple and Google engaged in anti-competitive conduct when it came to their respective app stores, ABC News reported.

While Judge Jonathan Beach found that the two tech giants had abused their dominant position in the market for app distribution to limit competition, he rejected Epic’s claims that the companies had engaged in “unconscionable conduct.”

Epic Games has been fighting Apple and Google’s fee structure for in-app purchases in various jurisdictions around the planet. The company scored a major win against Apple this year in the U.S., and as a result, Fortnite returned to Apple’s U.S. App Store after five years.

Tuesday’s ruling could yield a similar result for Epic in Australia: The company’s CEO Tim Sweeny said that the Epic Games Store and Fortnite would return to in the country soon through Epic Games Store.

“We welcome the court’s rejection of Epic’s demands that we distribute app stores from within the Google Play store, and Epic’s attacks on other critical security protections that users rely on. However, we disagree with the court’s characterisation of our billing policies and practices, as well as its findings regarding some of our historical partnerships,” a Google spokesperson said in an emailed statement.

Meanwhile, Apple told ABC News that its app store is the safest way for users to get apps, and that it disagreed with the court’s ruling on some of Epic’s claims.

Rebecca Tinucci, who previously spent six years building Tesla’s charging network before the automaker gutted its charging staff last year, will take over as head of Uber Freight. Ron will stay on as Uber Freight’s chairman.

“[Ron] will lead the go-to-market strategy, expanding key partnerships, and really bringing Waabi from the phase that we’ve been in to commercialization at scale,” Raquel Urtasun, Waabi’s founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. “He has shown his ability to scale from inception to a $5 billion revenue company with Uber Freight.”

Urtasun and Ron go way back: Ron previously co-founded self-driving truck company Otto, which Uber acquired in 2016. He overlapped with Urtasun at Uber, where the latter was chief scientist, leading the ride-hail firm’s self-driving research from 2017 to 2021.

Uber Freight is a digital marketplace connecting shippers with carriers, and the company aims to integrate self-driving trucks with the platform via partnerships with startups like Aurora Innovation and Waabi. Uber’s partnership with Waabi isn’t affected by Ron’s departure, he said.

While working at Uber Freight, Ron says, he met regularly with chief supply chain officers and big carriers that he said “could not wait” for self-driving trucks.

“If the most impactful thing to do in the next decade is autonomy, and if the timing is right, then for me it’s really about joining forces with who I think is most positioned to lead the transformation,” he added.

Urtasun claims Waabi’s “AI-first” approach to scaling autonomy has allowed it to do more with fewer resources and in less time than competitors. Given this is a capital-intensive industry that’s seen several promising startups, like TuSimple and Embark, crash and burn, efficiency can be a major advantage.

Since it was founded in 2021, Waabi has raised $287.7 million in total, the bulk of which came from a $200 million Series B in 2024. Urtasun claims the company doesn’t need to raise more to get to its next phase of growth.

The startup’s chief competitor is Aurora, which this year launched the first commercial driverless trucking route in the U.S., and has raised nearly $3.46 billion through a combination of venture capital and its public listing.

Waabi has managed to launch commercial pilots quickly because it does most training, testing, and validation in Waabi World, its closed-loop simulator that both virtually tests the self-driving software and teaches it in real time. More recently, Waabi took its simulator to the test track, overlaying virtual environments onto real-world driving conditions to simulate scenarios like accidents and construction zones without the actual risk, according to Urtasun.

“At the beginning of the year, we reached feature complete, which basically means we have all the necessary things to remove the driver and [are focused] on the final performance improvement and validation,” Urtasun said. “We are on track for our driverless launch by the end of the year, which is the start of commercialization.”

The startup plans to launch in Texas, which has become the autonomous freight capital of the U.S., but it hasn’t yet disclosed which routes it’ll operate on or with which launch partners. The startup is working with Volvo Autonomous Solutions to develop and deploy custom-built AVs.

“Waabi will lead the technology and it will scale autonomy faster than ever expected,” Ron said, adding that he’s excited with the prospect of integrating the technology into the customers’ operations. Part of that is a feature that would enable Waabi’s trucks to drive straight to customer depots, avoiding the need to build terminals for a hybrid setup.

“We’re going to create a commercial-ready solution that can really meet them,” Ron said.

On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) granted “in-principle” approval to Paytm’s Payment Services unit to operate as an online payment aggregator, parent company One97 Communications said in its filing (PDF) to Indian stock exchanges. The approval comes more than two years after the Noida-based fintech was initially denied the license in November 2022 due to noncompliance with India’s rules on receiving investments from countries that share a land border.

Without the license, Paytm was barred from onboarding new online merchants. At the time, the company said the restriction had “no material impact” on its business or revenues. However, at its annual general meeting last September, One97 Communications founder and CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma stated his intention to reapply for the payment aggregator license.

The approval also comes over a year after the RBI banned Paytm Payments Bank from accepting fresh deposits and enabling credit transactions. Paytm weathered that impact by quickly shifting gears and partnering with Axis, HDFC, State Bank of India, and Yes Bank to make them serve as payment system providers for its consumers and merchants involved in online transactions and autopay mandates.

With the new license, Paytm can operate as a service provider for online merchants, enabling them to accept a range of payment methods, including cards, net banking, and the Indian government-backed Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The approval also lifts the online merchant onboarding restrictions imposed by the central bank in 2022.

The approval comes just a week after China’s Ant Group exited Paytm by selling its remaining 5.8% direct stake in One97 Communications for $454 million through block deals. This follows an earlier exit in 2023, when Ant Financial sold a 10.3% stake — worth $628 million — to Sharma in a no-cash deal.

Paytm is required to undertake a “system audit,” including a cybersecurity review, and submit its report to the Reserve Bank of India within six months. If it fails to do so, the approval will lapse, per the RBI letter enclosed with the company’s stock exchange filing. The license is also limited to online payment services and does not extend beyond that scope.

The latest development will help Paytm control most of its value chain, from its offline sound boxes to the online payment gateway, and reduce its reliance on other bank partners, fintech investor Osborne Saldanha told TechCrunch.

Paytm is currently the third most-used UPI payments platform, behind Walmart-owned PhonePe and Google Pay. The fintech accounted for 6.9% of the total 18.4 billion UPI transactions in June and 5.6% of the transaction value, per the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). In total, Paytm processed 1.27 billion UPI transactions worth ₹1.34 trillion (approximately $15 billion).

Although Paytm trails PhonePe and Google Pay in the UPI market — with the duo handling over 82% of all UPI transactions in June — the company offers a broad suite of businesses and services to attract both consumers and merchants. These include offline merchant payment solutions with integrated hardware, software, and service layers, as well as a growing credit and lending business.

Paytm reported (PDF) net income of ₹1.23 billion (approximately $14 million) for the first quarter of its financial year 2026, ending in June — a turnaround from a loss during the same period last year. The results beat expectations, as analysts had projected a loss of ₹1.27 billion (approximately $14.5 million). Revenue rose 28% year-over-year to $224 million, while the company’s contribution margin improved to 60%, up from 50% a year ago.

In addition to its recent financial growth, Paytm’s shares have risen 13.25% year-to-date in 2025, signaling that the company is beginning to regain market confidence after more than a year of regulatory setbacks. The stock closed at ₹1,118.50 (approximately $13) on Wednesday, just before the regulatory approval was announced.

OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of “one size fits all” AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eliminate the need for users to navigate its model picker — a long, complicated menu of AI options that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has publicly said he hates.

But it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.

Altman said in a post on X Tuesday that the company introduced new “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5’s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.

Updates to ChatGPT:



You can now choose between “Auto”, “Fast”, and “Thinking” for GPT-5. Most users will want Auto, but the additional control will be useful for some people.



Rate limits are now 3,000 messages/week with GPT-5 Thinking, and then extra capacity on GPT-5 Thinking… — Sam Altman (@sama) August 13, 2025

Alongside GPT-5’s new modes, Altman said that paid users can once again access several legacy AI models — including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3 — which were deprecated just last week. GPT-4o is now in the model picker by default, while other AI models can be added from ChatGPT’s settings.

“We are working on an update to GPT-5’s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,” Altman wrote in the post on X. “However, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.”

ChatGPT’s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5’s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5’s rollout has been rougher than expected.

The deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a backlash among users who had grown attached to the AI models’ responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.

GPT-5’s model router also appeared to be largely broken on launch day. That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn’t as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an AMA session on Reddit. However, it seems that GPT-5’s router may still not be satisfying for all users.

“We’re not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,” wrote OpenAI’s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a post on X Tuesday.

Routing prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user’s preferences, as well as the specific question they’re asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second — that way, if a prompt goes to a fast responding AI model, the response can still be fast.

More broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another.

Human attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn’t well understood. For example, hundreds of people in San Francisco recently held a funeral for Anthropic’s AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, when it was taken offline. In other cases, AI chatbots seem to be contributing to mentally unstable people going down psychotic rabbit holes.

It seems OpenAI has more work to do around aligning its AI models to individual user preferences.",,"Maxwell Zeff, Senior Ai Reporter, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, Rebecca Bellan, Zack Whittaker, Dominic-Madori Davis, Aisha Malik, --C-Author-Card-Image-Size Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var, Media","model, router, ai, openai, gpt5, gpt5s, chatgpts, disrupt, company, complicated, picker, users, models",pending,2025-08-13T07:35:52.262062+00:00,1eb4e4b82fa2a8b04390a61d27535fa48ed05b91452b580f64e01b69162ad656

The AI giant said Tuesday it would also offer its Claude models to government agencies for just $1 — but not only to the executive branch. Anthropic is targeting “all three branches” of the U.S. government, including the legislative and judiciary branches.

The package will be available for one year, says Anthropic.

The move comes after OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google DeepMind were added to the General Services Administration’s list of approved AI vendors that can sell their services to civilian federal agencies. TechCrunch has reached out to Google to see if it plans to respond to Anthropic’s and OpenAI’s challenges in kind.

Anthropic’s escalation — a response to OpenAI’s attempt to undercut the competition — is a strategic play meant to broaden the company’s foothold in federal AI usage.

“We believe the U.S. public sector should have access to the most advanced AI capabilities to tackle complex challenges, from scientific research to constituent services,” Anthropic said in a statement. “By combining broad accessibility with uncompromising security standards, we’re helping ensure AI serves the public interest.”

Anthropic will offer both Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government. The latter supports FedRAMP High workloads so that federal workers can use Claude for handling sensitive unclassified work, according to the company.

FedRAMP High is a stringent security baseline within the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) for handling unclassified sensitive government data.

Anthropic will also provide technical support to help agencies integrate AI tools into their workflows, according to the company.

Anthropic, along with OpenAI, xAI, and Google, has been granted up to $200 million by the Department of Defense to leverage AI for national security, but the AI firm clearly hopes to integrate into a broader array of government work, including science research and health services. Anthropic noted in its press release that Claude is already being used at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to accelerate scientific discoveries, and also by the District of Columbia Department of Health to help residents access health services in multiple languages.

Anthropic says it is able to make such deployments because Claude “meets the government’s highest security standards.” Aside from being certified for FedRAMP High, customers can access Claude through their existing secure infrastructure via partnerships with AWS, Google Cloud, and Palantir, giving them more control over their data.

Anthropic’s multicloud access could give it an edge in the competition with OpenAI, whose current official FedRAMP High offering is tied to Azure Government Cloud only. While Azure is widely adopted in government, some government agencies and security teams might prioritize data sovereignty, infrastructure control, and the operational flexibility a multicloud strategy offers.

OpenAI is, however, actively working to reduce its reliance on Azure so it can embrace a more diversified infrastructure approach.

Of the 337 active and revenue-generating AI companion apps available worldwide, 128 were released in 2025 so far, according to new data provided to TechCrunch by app intelligence firm Appfigures. This subsection of the AI market on mobile has now generated $82 million during the first half of the year and is on track to pull in over $120 million by year-end, the firm’s analysis indicates.

Unlike general-purpose chatbots, AI companion apps anthropomorphize AI interactions by allowing users to converse with custom characters, including friends, lovers, girlfriends or boyfriends, fantasy characters, and more. Appfigures defined the market segment in the same way, describing companion apps as those in which the user can interact with either premade or user-generated synthetic characters meant to embody an actual personality.

Popular apps in this space include Replika, Character.AI, PolyBuzz, Chai, and others.

As of July 2025, AI companion apps across the Apple App Store and Google Play have been downloaded 220 million times globally. During the first half of 2025, downloads were up 88% year-over-year, reaching 60 million.

Appfigures crunched the numbers and found that, as of July 2025, AI companion apps have driven $221 million in consumer spending worldwide. So far this year, these apps have generated 64% more revenue than during the same period in 2024.

The top 10% of all AI companion apps generate 89% of the revenue in the category, the data shows. In addition, around 10% (or 33) of the apps have exceeded $1 million in lifetime consumer spending.

Revenue per download is also up $0.66, from $0.52 in 2024 to $1.18 for the category so far in 2025.

While dedicated AI companion apps are fairly popular, bigger companies like xAI are also moving into the market. In July, xAI’s Grok launched AI companions, including an anime girl and guy, as well as a snarky 3D fox.

Meanwhile, ChatGPT’s recent upgrade to GPT-5 brought to light the fact that many of its users felt a kinship with the older model, as they mourned the loss of their AI companion, whom they had come to depend upon.

To address these and other concerns about GPT-5’s performance, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman brought back the 4o model for the time being.

Google last year tapped into the market, too, when it hired away Character.ai’s founder, Noam Shazeer. The Character.ai app lives on and still has tens of millions of monthly active users.

According to Appfigures’ data, the most popular AI companion apps are those used by people looking for an AI girlfriend. Of the active apps on the market today, 17% have an app name that includes the word “girlfriend,” compared with 4% that say “boyfriend” or “fantasy.” Terms like anime, soulmate, and lover, among others, are less frequently mentioned.

The firm notes there were likely a number of other AI companion apps that launched on the app stores since 2022, but were later removed after failing to gain traction in terms of revenue or downloads. Those weren’t factored into its analysis, however.

Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper said Russia “is at least in part responsible” for the cyberattack, without saying what part of the Russian government is behind the hack.

The hackers searched for “midlevel criminal cases in the New York City area and several other jurisdictions, with some cases involving people with Russian and Eastern European surnames,” per the article.

Last week, Politico reported that hackers had broken into the federal judiciary’s electronic case filing system, potentially accessing the identities of confidential informants, which are redacted and not publicly known, putting those people at risk of retaliation from the criminals they are helping authorities apprehend.

Politico reported that the stolen data could include sealed criminal dockets and indictments, arrest warrants, and other documents not yet public, or may never actually be included in public dockets.

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the agency that oversees the U.S. federal court system, confirmed a cyberattack in a statement on August 7.

The New York Times also quoted a memo sent to Justice Department officials, clerks, and chief judges by the court system’s administrators, which said that “persistent and sophisticated cyber threat actors have recently compromised sealed records.” The email said “this remains an URGENT MATTER that requires immediate action.”

This may not be Russia’s first rodeo targeting the U.S. federal court system.

In 2020, a long-running Russian cyberattack targeted the SolarWinds software, used by large tech companies and government agencies, to deliver a tainted software update allowing Russian government hackers backdoor access to the networks of SolarWinds customers.

The widespread hack affected several U.S. government departments, including PACER, allowing the theft of sealed court documents.

The U.S. Courts, in its statement on August 7, said that the agency was “enhancing security of the system and to block future attacks, and it is prioritizing working with courts to mitigate the impact on litigants.”",,"Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, Zack Whittaker, Senior Reporter, Security Editor, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, Rebecca Bellan, Dominic-Madori Davis, Aisha Malik, --C-Author-Card-Image-Size Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var","hackers, system, hack, sealed, filing, cyberattack, federal, courts, statement, report, york, court, russian",pending,2025-08-13T07:35:50.416545+00:00,f9024e74229f4fcebb051515aa62d665f528d702092b01245320f6068fbc8cce

StubHub is giving a strong indication that its IPO is back on again. It filed a public S-1 in late March, then paused in April after the Trump administration’s tariffs spooked Wall Street. On Monday, it filed an updated S-1 that now includes Q1 2025 results.



IPO experts Renaissance Capital estimated in March that the IPO could raise $1 billion, and says this fresh S-1 could mean a debut next month. StubHub declined to comment on its IPO plans, citing its quiet period.

In 2024, it generated nearly $1.8 billion in revenue and recorded a net loss of $2.8 million.

The two hackers, who go by Saber and cyb0rg, published a report about the breach in the latest issue of Phrack magazine, a legendary cybersecurity e-zine that was first published in 1985. The latest issue was distributed at the Def Con hackers conference in Las Vegas last week.

In the article, the two hackers wrote that they were able to compromise a workstation containing a virtual machine and a virtual private server belonging to the hacker, whom they call “Kim.” The hackers claim Kim works for the North Korean government espionage group known as Kimsuky, also known as APT43 and Thallium. The hackers leaked the stolen data to DDoSecrets, a nonprofit collective that stores leaked datasets in the public interest.

Kimsuky is a prolific advanced persistent threat (APT) group widely believed to be working inside North Korea’s government, targeting journalists and government agencies in South Korea and elsewhere, and other targets that could be of interest for North Korea’s intelligence apparatus.

As is usual with North Korea, Kimsuky also conducts operations more akin to a cybercriminal group — for example, stealing and laundering cryptocurrencies to fund North Korea’s nuclear weapons program.

This hack gives an almost-unprecedented look inside the operation of Kimsuky, given that the two hackers compromised one of the group’s members, rather than investigating a data breach as cybersecurity researchers and companies typically have to rely on.

“It shows a glimpse how openly ‘Kimsuky’ cooperates with Chinese [government hackers] and shares their tools and techniques,” the hackers wrote.

Obviously, what Saber and cyb0rg did is technically a crime, although they will likely never be prosecuted for it, considering North Korea is sanctioned up to its eyeballs. The two hackers clearly believe Kimsuky members deserve to be exposed and embarrassed.

“Kimsuky, you’re not a hacker. You are driven by financial greed, to enrich your leaders, and to fulfill their political agenda. You steal from others and favour your own. You value yourself above the others: You are morally perverted,” the two wrote in Phrack. “You hack for all the wrong reasons.”

Saber and cyb0rg claim to have found evidence of Kimsuky compromising several South Korean government networks and companies, email addresses, and hacking tools used by the Kimsuky group, internal manuals, passwords, and more data.

Emails sent to the addresses allegedly belonging to the hackers, which were listed in the research, went unanswered.

The hackers wrote that they were able to identify Kim as a North Korean government hacker, thanks to “artifacts and hints” that pointed in that direction, including files configurations and domains previously attributed to the North Korean hacking group Kimsuky.

The hackers also noted Kim’s “strict office hours, always connecting at around 09:00 and disconnecting by 17:00 Pyongyang time.”",,"Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, Senior Reporter, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, Rebecca Bellan, Zack Whittaker, Dominic-Madori Davis, Aisha Malik, --C-Author-Card-Image-Size Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var, Media","hackers, leaked, korean, operation, major, expose, kimsuky, hacker, phrack, wrote, breach, spying, kim, group, north",pending,2025-08-13T07:35:49.194921+00:00,c8de6d5753de0d3dbd53a7804dffb13e4b38495ce5600a1202aa00b61f80f38f

After more than 17 years at the company, he departed to launch his own startup.

“I was seeing how fast technology was changing, and I felt there are certain ideas that are best explored in the context of a startup,” Petrou told TechCrunch.

His ultimate idea was to build Continua, a consumer-facing company that uses AI agents to enhance collaboration and interaction in group chats on SMS, iMessage, and Discord.

“The simple way to think about it is that we’re bringing the power of LLMs to group chats,” Petrou said.

Continua announced on Tuesday that it has raised an $8 million seed round. The funding was led by GV, with additional participation from Bessemer Ventures Partners and a group of angel investors.

When developing Continua, Petrou noticed that people would interact with ChatGPT or another LLM, and then would copy and paste what they learned into their group conversation.

“If you and I are planning a trip, or if we’re trying to figure out what to have for dinner, or what movie to watch, all of these things can be facilitated by an LLM participating in a group chat with us,” Petrou said.

Continua claims its AI agents can reduce group chat chaos by joining conversations and offering helpful information only when it’s needed.

As the group discusses projects and common plans, Continua can automatically set reminders, launch polls, add calendar invitations, or generate Google documents with checklists and to-do lists.

If a user forgets details from the group chat, such as the meeting time or location, they can simply direct message Continua to privately ask for the information.

At first glance, Continua may seem like a straightforward application of AI, but Petrou says that getting LLMs to participate in a conversation with multiple humans is a rather complex technical problem. Since most AI models are designed for conversations between a single person and a single assistant, Continua had to fine-tune LLMs to understand the dynamics of group chat discussions.

For instance, group members do not need Continua to respond to everything they write.

“You want the agent to have social intelligence,” Petrou said. He added that they had to “break the LLM’s brain” to naturally integrate the AI into conversations.

Users can invoke Continua when they need its help or tell the agent to “hang back” if it’s chiming in too often.

Users can get started with Continua by adding its phone number to a group SMS or its username to a Discord chat.

While several companies, including Meta and the startup Hey Umai, offer AI agents for conversations, Petrou insists that Continua is most suitable for group interactions.

Erik Nordlander, a general partner at GV, said his firm invested in Petrou even before the concept of Continua’s group chat AI had fully taken shape. “David is a really brilliant engineer, someone who’s been working with AI since before it was the hot thing.”

According to Nordlander, Continua has several potential paths to profitability. The agent is already assisting with event planning and trip booking, which he suggested they could charge for in the future.

Perplexity tells TC the terms of the offer include a commitment to keep Chrome’s underlying engine, Chromium, open source and continue to invest in it. Perplexity’s offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.

Perplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default.

Google could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds.

This bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling.

The Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)

When the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, both OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare according to Statcounter, if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well.

Interestingly, the CEO of rival search engine DuckDuckGo testified in April that Chrome could be worth “upwards of $50 billion,” Bloomberg reported at the time. Should Perplexity’s offer succeed, it could be considered a bargain.

Still, this offer for Chrome is far more than Perplexity has raised from investors and more than the startup’s current valuation. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, PitchBook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, Bloomberg reported.

In the meantime, Perplexity last month launched its own browser, called Comet, in its bid to grow its AI search business without having to serve its customers through a browser, particularly one owned by its main rival Google.

The startup is expected to be valued at $850 million. A source familiar with the deal tells TechCrunch that talks are still early and OpenAI has not yet committed to participation, so terms could change.

Merge Labs is also reportedly working with Alex Blania, who runs Tools for Humanity (formerly World) — Altman’s eye-scanning digital ID project that “allows anyone to verify their humanness,” as the company describes.

Merge Labs will compete with Elon Musk’s Neuralink, which is developing computer interface chips designed to be implanted in the brain. Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 (although its existence wasn’t known until 2017) and the company has made serious progress.

Neuralink is currently in trials with people who suffer from severe paralysis. It aims to allow them to control devices with their thoughts. It raised a $600 million Series E at a $9 billion valuation in June.

Neuralink (and perhaps, Merge Labs) could revolutionize how humans interact with technology. Some might even say their tech could take humanity toward “the singularity.”

Long before Silicon Valley became obsessed with the concept of artificial general intelligence (AGI), it was enamored with “the singularity.” Musk has used the term to describe a time when AI surpasses human intelligence. The more classic definition (after a 1960’s novella of the same name by Dino Buzzati) means the merging of tech with humans.

Altman blogged about “The Merge” in 2017. “Although the merge has already begun, it’s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants,” he postulated at the time, citing research work he saw at OpenAI, where Musk was still a co-founder.

Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and the relationship between the two tech leaders has since disintegrated. Just this week, Altman and Musk were bickering on X after Altman accused Musk of manipulating X and Musk called Altman a liar.

We’ll have to wait and see when and if Merge Labs becomes formally announced. But it stands to reason that Altman wasn’t going to let Musk work on something as important as the singularity without a challenger.

Despite being a highly regulated industry, equity trading has consistently been at the forefront of technological innovations in the financial services sector. However, when it comes to agents and AI applications, many banks have taken a more cautious approach to adoption.

TD Securities, the equity and securities trading arm of TD Bank, rolled out its TD AI Virtual Assistant on July 8, aimed toward its front office institutional sales, trading and research professionals to help them manage their workflow.

TD Securities CIO Dan Bosman told VentureBeat that the virtual assistant’s primary goal is to help front-office equity sales and traders gain client insights and research.

“The first version of this began as a pilot, which we then subsequently scaled,” Bosman said. “It’s really about accessing that equity research data that our analysts put out and bringing it to the hands of the sales team in a way that’s sales-friendly.”

Bosman noted that being around a trading floor means being exposed to a lot of the lingo, and the context in which users ask some questions feels very unique. So the AI assistant has to sound natural, intuitive and access the insights generated by traders.

Building TD AI

Bosman said the idea for the AI assistant came from a member of the equity sales team. Fortunately, the bank has a platform called TD Invent, where employees can bring ideas and the innovation leadership team can evaluate projects responsibly.

“Someone in our equity research sales desk came in and pretty much said, I’ve got this idea and brought it to TD Invent,” Bosman said. “What I’ve loved most about this is when you build something super magical, you don’t need to go out and sell or put a face on it. Folks come in and say to us, ‘we want this, we need this or we’ve got ideas,’ and it’s truly the best when we’re able to bring our investment in data, cloud and infrastructure together.”

TD Security built the TD AI virtual assistant by leveraging OpenAI’s GPT models. Bosman said TD worked with its technology teams and the Canadian AI company Layer 6, which the bank acquired in 2018, as well as with other strategic partnerships. The assistant integrates with the bank’s cloud infrastructure, allowing it to access internal research documents and market data, such as 13F filings and historical equity data.

Bosman calls TDS AI a Knowledge Management System, a term that generally encompasses its ability to retrieve, through retrieval augmented generation (RAG) processes, aggregate and synthesize information into “concise context-aware summaries and insights” so its sales teams can answer client questions.

TD AI virtual assistant also gives users access to TD Bank’s foundation model, TD AI Prism.

The model, launched in June, is in use throughout the entire bank and not just for TD Securities. During the launch, the bank said TD AI Prism will improve the predictive performance of TD Bank’s applications by processing 100 times more data, replacing its single-architecture models and ensuring customer data stays internal.

“The development posed unique challenges, as gen AI was relatively new to the organization when the initiative began, requiring careful navigation of governance and controls,” Bosman said. “Despite this, the project successfully brought together diverse teams across the enterprise, fostering collaboration to deliver a cutting-edge solution.”

He added that one of the standout features is its text-to-SQL capability, which converts natural language prompts into SQL queries.

To train the assistant, Bosman said TD Securities developed optimizations to make the process easier.

“With patent-pending optimizations in prompt engineering and dynamic few-shot examples retrieval, we successfully achieved the business’s desired performance through context learning,” Bosman said. “As a result, fine-tuning the underlying OpenAI model was not required for interacting with both unstructured as well as tabular datasets.”

Banks slowly entering the agentic era

TD Bank and TD Securities, of course, are not the only banks interested in expanding from assistants to AI agents.

BNY told VentureBeat that it began offering multi-agent solutions to its sales teams to help answer customer questions, such as those related to foreign currency support. Wells Fargo also saw an increase in the usage of its internal AI assistant. For its auto sales customers, Capital One built an agent that helps them sell more cars.

Many of these use cases emerged after months of pilot testing, as is the case in every other industry; however, financial institutions have the additional burden of strict customer data privacy and fiduciary responsibilities.

TD Securities’ Bosman noted that many employees, even on the bank’s business side, are increasingly familiar with tools like ChatGPT. The challenge with pilot testing assistants and agents lies less in teaching them about the tools, but in establishing best practices for using the assistants, integrating them into existing workflows, understanding their limitations and how humans can provide feedback to mitigate hallucinations.

Eventually, Bosman said the assistant would evolve into something even its users outside of the bank would want to use when interacting with TD Securities.

“My vision is that we see AI as something that can add value to us, but also to external customers at the bank. Right now, it’s a massive opportunity for us around driving a stronger client experience and delivering a better colleague experience,” Bosman said.",,Emilia David,"teams, bank, securities, sales, realtime, ai, banks, td, openai, insights, assistant, equity, layer, bosman, trading, taps, data",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:40.165450+00:00,64d075a75336c3ead8dd9feb23ff656adc3d01b49f7a17a45748a5a633d88430

But for some users, last Thursday’s release felt more like a wrenching downgrade, with the new ChatGPT presenting a diluted personality and making surprisingly dumb mistakes.

On Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to X to say the company would keep the previous model, GPT-4o, running for Plus users. A new feature designed to seamlessly switch between models depending on the complexity of the query had broken on Thursday, Altman said, “and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber.” He promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5’s performance and the overall user experience.

Given the hype around GPT-5, some level of disappointment appears inevitable. When OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March 2023, it stunned AI experts with its incredible abilities. GPT-5, pundits speculated, would surely be just as jaw-dropping.

Join our next subscriber-only livestream on Thursday, August 14, to chat all things GPT-5 with Will Knight, Kylie Robison, and Reece Rogers.

OpenAI touted the model as a significant upgrade, with PhD-level intelligence and virtuoso coding skills. A system to automatically route queries to different models was meant to provide a smoother user experience. (It could also save the company money by directing simple queries to cheaper models.)

Soon after GPT-5 dropped, however, a Reddit community dedicated to ChatGPT filled with complaints. Many users mourned the loss of the old model.

“I’ve been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn’t feel the same. It’s more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn’t innovation, it’s erasure.”

“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.

Other threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.

Altman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”

Errors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.

The backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.

In March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o after it became too sycophantic.

“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more “business” and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing, because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”

Altman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.

“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn’t describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”",,"Will Knight, Lauren Goode, Reece Rogers, Kylie Robison, Matt Burgess","model, chatgpt, openai, gpt5, revolt, models, company, scrambles, users, x, wrote, things, update",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:06.768512+00:00,b1051e9f041fed6c80f07c574ce1d6e1ee8cdc1f19685022ca30a09ab28669cd

Zoë Schiffer: Hey, this is Zoë. Before we start, I want to share some exciting news with you. We're doing a live show in San Francisco on September 9th in partnership with KQED. Uncanny Valley cohosts Lauren Good and Michael Calore will sit down with our editor in chief, Katie Drummond, and a special guest for a conversation that you really won't want to miss. You can use the link in the show notes to grab your ticket and invite a friend. We can't wait to see you there. Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED's director of business and industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, we're bringing you five stories that you need to know about this week. And later we'll dive into our main topic, which is about how OpenAI just announced a massive partnership with the US government to make its models available to federal employees. I'm joined today by WIRED senior writer Jake Lahut. Jake, welcome to Uncanny Valley.

Jake Lahut: Hey Zoë. Good to be back.

Zoë Schiffer: OK, so our first story is actually from your newsletter Inner Loop, and it's yet another Jeffrey Epstein saga. It just won't quit. So sources have been telling you that the damage done by the Jeffrey Epstein saga is just not going to go away anytime soon. As listeners may know, conspiracy theories around Epstein's death received a lot of fresh fuel in recent weeks when the DOJ released what they called raw footage from the night of his death, but then WIRED analyzed the video and found that it had been modified after all. These conspiracy theories have been at the core of the MAGA base for years now, and you wrote really smartly about how sources say there's simply nothing that can be done to salvage the ongoing catastrophe that is the MAGA base fraying over the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein.

iRobot, maker of the iconic Roomba robot vacuum, announced its second-quarter earnings late last week, and the numbers keep going down. Despite launching an entirely new product line, its revenue declined 23 percent to $127.6 million from the previous quarter, with the lucrative US and European markets being hit hardest.

The company has struggled in the face of increased competition from Chinese manufacturers and the collapse of a sale to Amazon, which left it deep in debt. Earlier this year, CEO Gary Cohen indicated iRobot could shut down within 12 months if something didn’t change. The clock is ticking.

Last week, Cohen said that while customer response to the new product line has been “encouraging,” iRobot didn’t meet its goals this quarter “due to persistent market headwinds and delays in scaling production and sales of our new products.” He confirmed the company is still looking at a potential sale or other “strategic alternatives” to get out of debt.",,Jennifer Pattison Tuohy,"sale, debt, irobot, quarter, isnt, week, didnt, company, line, cohen, looking, irobots, future, product",pending,2025-08-13T07:35:55.977203+00:00,29b4fbd1e508c7175d740fae9ecf6c45b15000e20aaca0eed09b331acba3ac7d

If you look at everything he’s written since having children—including the TV series Fargo and Legion—Hawley says it all revolves around the same question every parent faces: “How are we supposed to raise these people in the world that we're living in?”

Hawley’s new series, Alien: Earth, which premieres August 12 on Hulu and FX, explores this question even more directly than his previous work. Set two years before the original Alien in 2120, it imagines a future where the race for immortality has led to three competing technologies: synths (AI minds in synthetic bodies), cyborgs (humans with cybernetic enhancements), and hybrids (human minds downloaded into synthetic bodies).

When a deep space research vessel, the USCSS Maginot, crashes into Earth carrying five captured alien species, a megacorporation called Prodigy sends six hybrids to investigate. The first-ever hybrid, Wendy, played by Sydney Chandler, was a terminally ill child before she was selected for the immortality experiment, just like the rest of Prodigy’s hybrids, all six of whom wake up in super-strong, super-fast, synthetic adult bodies that will never age.

“It's a very biological process through which we grow up,” Hawley tells WIRED, “and so the idea that you're going to take these prepubescent children and put them in adult bodies … How are they going to become adults?”

While Alien: Earth is rife with the creature horror and body horror that made its predecessors a cultural phenomenon, Hawley also wanted to introduce “moral horror” via the hybrid characters. “We’re often asked in our lives to make these impossible choices—choices that would be impossible for an adult,” he says. “But to put a child in those positions is really awful,” especially in a future where every aspect of life on Earth—from continents and cities down to the hybrids’ bodies and memories—is owned by a handful of ruthless corporations.

In 2025, we already have runaway income inequality, a push for “startup cities” free from federal laws, a two-company race to build the first brain-computer interface, and the first warning signs of unregulated AI. In Alien: Earth, Hawley asks what kind of world our children will inherit in 2120 if we continue down the same roads.

New Company Towns Will Be “Wetter” and “Tiered”

In Hawley’s vision of the future, Earth’s nation-states have been replaced by corporate territories: North and South America are owned by Weyland-Yutani; Europe by Threshold; North Africa and the Middle East by Dynamic; Russia by Lynch; and East Asia, Australia, Greenland, and Iceland by the relatively new upstart Prodigy, which manufactures synths in addition to soft drinks.

Like the company towns for industrial workers of the 19th century, where housing, schools, stores, and other amenities were owned by an employer, much of Alien: Earth is set in the Prodigy “corporate city” of New Siam, which was based on and filmed on location in Bangkok.",,"Adam Morgan, Jake Kleinman, Wired Staff, Angela Watercutter, Matt Kamen, Louise Matsakis","future, prodigy, hybrids, hawley, hellscape, alien, horror, earth, synthetic, owned, corporate, bodies",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:39.324396+00:00,6e0a0270cf348524201e3e31efcfcdbd2b50e81a68026e685cd3f7922a7416be
45,thenextweb.com,https://thenextweb.com/news/eu-fintech-regulations-mica-dora-amla,Opinion: Europe can regulate its way to a better fintech future,2025-08-11T07:00:40+00:00,"Crypto crashes, money laundering, and digital fraud — the EU’s financial watchdogs have had enough. Regulatory bodies need to keep up by rolling out tighter regulations aimed at strengthening consumer protections and stabilising the market.

As EU lawmakers scramble to protect consumers, others worry they are smothering growth. Case in point: in 2024, the FCA fined HSBC £6.2mn for not properly treating customers in financial difficulty. The regulatory bodies are defending the public, but had restrictions been lighter, would HSBC have had more creative solutions for its customers, such as embedding personalised, data-first lending?

Banks have been fearful of exploring innovative embedded lending solutions, as they were 15% more likely to receive formal enforcement action. However, in August 2024, HSBC decided the benefits were worth the compliance battle.

While some argue that regulation can hinder innovation — with companies hesitant to invest in operations due to increased oversight — others state that additional regulation will increase innovation and, with that, see regulation as a key driver of their growth. So, who’s right?

Breaking down the recent EU fintech regulations

Recently, a few new regulations came into effect in the EU that have majorly impacted fintechs.

DORA, implemented in January 2025, requires EU-established financial institutions (FIs) to implement processes and structures to help them respond to and recover from ICT-related disruption, providing them with extra digital resilience. Additionally, the AMLA is being introduced to give governments more assurance in combatting money laundering.

DORA and the AMLA will apply to all FIs and their products and processes, but leave crypto outside their scope. That’s where MiCA comes in. Rolled out in December 2024, MiCA was drafted to protect individual crypto users.

The EU’s regulatory agenda — especially with the introduction of MiCA, DORA, and AMLA — is about tightening oversight. However, it is also part of a broader strategy to simplify and harmonise regulations, providing stability to the EU financial markets as a whole. The latest rulings strike a delicate balance between reassuring consumers and regulators, and easing the burden on regulated FIs.

A new set of regulations may seem contradictory to the so-called Competitiveness Compass — published in January by the European Commission — which includes initiatives on simplifying and effectively implementing EU law. Nevertheless, these laws aim to replace fragmented national rules with unified EU-wide frameworks, making compliance clearer, faster, and more predictable.

As the digital finance ecosystem continues to accelerate, MiCA, DORA, and AMLA form a comprehensive framework. Collectively, they aim to balance innovation with financial stability, consumer protection, and security throughout the fintech sector.

Will these updates support or slow innovation in fintech and banking?

This answer depends on the perspective. Recent EU regulations may slow innovation in the short term, particularly for the larger and well-established FIs like banks, but the future outlook looks more fruitful. These new rules are designed to support long-term stability.

As these three regulations require full harmonisation across the member states, they’re designed to reduce fragmentation and regulatory arbitrage. A bigger and more uniform market will encourage cross-border activities, innovation, and competitiveness between fintechs and related service providers. The regulations also support the creation of better, more transparent products and services, helping to increase consumer and regulator trust, ultimately boosting customer adoption.

In short, this environment will offer greater opportunities for smaller and more agile fintechs to scale and compete long-term. For consumers and businesses, acting on the latest regulations results in more reliable and resilient services, which are much needed for essential functions like digital payments and lending.

These new regulations level the playing field, encouraging traditional banks and fintechs to compete on innovation and service quality rather than only on regulatory strengths. Moreover, a stable and secure financial system boosts the EU’s attractiveness as a hub for digital financial services, which will help make the union more attractive to new investors and innovations than the US.

What investments will be required to meet these new standards?

Additional investment in governance and compliance structures is needed. Bigger, more well-established players may struggle to implement the required regulatory changes in their extensive processes and products. Those with existing compliance and governance processes will likely find the transition more seamless, while smaller fintechs may need to build these from scratch. The costs of their implementation present a potential hurdle.

Navigating compliance is often a significant challenge for fintech startups and other smaller players. They’ll need to invest in knowledge, including how to correctly implement regulatory requirements into their processes and product designs, and translate these into operational business processes.

On top of this, investments in technology will need to be made as businesses must meet customer-facing requirements around transparency and language. For example, stricter anti-money laundering (AML) requirements will demand changes in know your customer (KYC) and transaction monitoring tools.

However, compliance with the DORA regulatory framework is what will entail the biggest investment in technology, since digital operational resilience requires more robust security, backup, and testing methods. When working with partners who are fluent in compliance, the long-term payoff is clear.

The new finance model: Legacy institutions meet agile innovators

New technology has changed the way people interact with financial services, driving the growth of fintechs and increasing rivalry with established banks. One report found that 36% of 18-24-year-olds would choose fintech platforms over conventional financial institutions. Built on modern tech stacks and lean teams, fintechs’ agility allows them to react fast to changing consumer needs and market trends — a sharp contrast to the legacy infrastructure slowing down traditional banks.

However, for both the old and new factions to succeed in Europe’s evolving regulatory landscape, traditional institutions and digital-native disruptors will need to depend on alliances. Effective partnerships between fintechs, banks, and FIs under the new EU regulations will be based on a mutual effort to enhance compliance, embrace innovation, and strengthen operational resilience. These collaborations are key for navigating complex regulations while delivering secure, innovative financial services.

Fintechs, FIs, customers, and merchants can also all benefit from Banking-as-a-Service (BaaS) partnerships. For example, in the case of embedded lending, banks that partner with technology providers can scale quickly into new revenue opportunities, reaching new and existing customers outside of the direct scope of the bank, and thus try to keep pace with fintech competitors, without building their own technology in-house.

In fact, 41% of FIs have already implemented embedded finance solutions, and close to 50% have expanded their BaaS capabilities. Merchant customers then gain convenient, safe access to regulated, secure, innovative financial products from a trusted bank.

Another way that banks and fintechs can increase innovation while ensuring compliance is by engaging in collaborative models, including participation in regulatory sandboxes. These controlled environments can support testing of new financial products and services under the supervision of regulators, providing a balance between innovation and regulatory compliance.

The EU’s new wave of financial regulations isn’t just about tightening control — It’s part of a bigger push to simplify and unify rules across Europe. By uniforming patchwork national laws with consistent, EU-wide standards, compliance is now simpler to follow and predict. This uniformity and predictability can help encourage innovation while keeping consumer protection and financial stability front and centre. As fintech and banks collaborate, the future of digital finance in Europe is on track to be more open, safe, reliable, and inclusive.",,"Wouter Moolenaar, Story By","fintech, fintechs, regulatory, better, future, compliance, opinion, europe, banks, way, regulations, digital, financial, eu, regulate, innovation",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:19.958547+00:00,82915dce672f569d8b8d15c2f708b1453be1e0bcd65964d3688094326009eb6c

Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance.

But a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it's a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist.

Palantir has tried to correct the record itself in a series of blog posts with titles like “Palantir Is Not a Data Company” and “Palantir Is Still Not a Data Company.” In the latter, Palantir explains that “misconceptions can arise because our products are complicated,” but nonetheless, “it is absolutely possible” to accurately describe them to “people who are curious.”

The problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It's really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it's hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?”

Xia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is.

It’s not that former employees literally don’t know what Palantir is selling. In interviews with WIRED, they spoke fluidly about how its software can connect and transform different kinds of data collected by government agencies and corporations. But when asked to, say, name its direct business competitors, two former Palantir employees who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, struggled to come up with anything. “I still don't know how to answer that question, to be honest,” says one.

Juan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.”",,"Caroline Haskins, Dell Cameron, Kylie Robison, Tomas Apodaca, Molly Taft, Joel Khalili, Lauren Goode, Matt Burgess, Vittoria Elliott, Megan Farokhmanesh","really, employees, actually, software, think, works, company, wired, does, palantir, data",pending,2025-08-16T13:29:43.835619+00:00,96729e151ccc95b210d4d5ca4405f334c0976affdf2c0168788fa6caa0349ae3

It seems to have worked.

After the afternoon meeting at the White House, Mr. Trump posted on Truth Social that his discussion with Mr. Tan “was a very interesting one,” though he did not elaborate. Mr. Trump said that Mr. Tan and cabinet members would meet next week and “bring suggestions to me,” adding that the Intel chief’s “success and rise is an amazing story.”

Mr. Trump’s post appeared to signal that he was changing his mind about any national security risk posed by Mr. Tan, 65, who became Intel’s chief executive in March. Mr. Trump’s call last week for Mr. Tan to resign, citing his past investments in Chinese companies, was one of the first times the president had attempted to directly intervene to change the leadership at a major publicly traded company.

iOS 26 now offers six alternate versions of default ringtone, plus new Little Bird option

In earlier beta versions of iOS 26, Apple included a single new ringtone for users. It was labeled ‘Alt 1’ under the default Reflection ringtone.

Now, that new option has been given a proper name: Reflected.

But more significant than that, it’s been joined by five brand new alternate takes on the default ringtone.

In iOS 26 beta 6, the Settings app includes a total of seven options for the default Reflection ringtone.

Those options are:

Default

Buoyant

Dreamer

Pond

Pop

Reflected

You can listen to all the new options below:

Default is the only carryover from iOS 18. It remains unchanged from the standard tune iPhone users are very familiar with.

Reflected was available in prior betas, under the ‘Alt 1’ name, and now it’s joined by Buoyant, Dreamer, Pond, Pop, and Surge.

If you’re looking for something altogether different, today’s beta has also added a brand new option called ‘Little Bird.’

These additions arrive alongside several big changes coming to Apple’s Phone app in iOS 26, which you can read about here.

One concern is explainability — understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.

Seoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models — without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, ACVC Partners, and SBI Investment, among others.

David Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea’s Agency for Defense Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.

Even before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.

In its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The 7-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.

“They wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,” Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. “That’s when we realized: We were already doing AI model evaluation — without even knowing it.” Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea’s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.

“We started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,” Kim told TechCrunch.

Meta’s recent $14.3 billion acquisition-like investment in data-labeling company Scale AI highlights the importance of this market. Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI’s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.

Datumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.

Unlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.

When asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.

The new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.

The explosion of quick-commerce in the country has meant that millions of Indians are getting increasingly used to not having to wait for deliveries, or step out of their homes, as startups vie to make almost everything, from food and groceries to smartphones and gaming consoles, available within minutes.

It seems investors, too, don’t want to wait long: A budding startup out of New Delhi called Pronto, which lets users book and avail cleaning, laundry and home services within 10 minutes, has tripled its valuation in less than 90 days.

It was only in May when Pronto raised a $2 million seed round at a $12.5 million valuation. The startup has now raised an $11 million Series A round at a post-money valuation of $45 million, co-led by General Catalyst and Glade Brook Capital. Existing investor Bain Capital Ventures also participated in this round.

The new funding comes in the wake of solid traction: Pronto claims its revenue has risen by nearly five times, founder and CEO Anjali Sardana told TechCrunch, since it came out of stealth barely three months ago.

The startup now has bookings numbering in the “four-digits” every day, and expects annual recurring revenue in the range of $750,000 to $1.5 million, Sardana said, though she declined to disclose exact figures.

“It largely comes down to two things: one being momentum and the insane speed at which we were scaling, as well as just investors recognizing the quality of the team and how fast we were executing,” Sardana said, explaining what led investors to fund the Series A so soon after its seed round.

For investors, Sardana seems to be the primary reason they bet this early. “We were very impressed by Anjali,” said Rahul Garg, a partner at General Catalyst. “Given how young she is, given that she spent a lot of her time in the U.S. after she’s come to India, what she’s been able to achieve, the feedback from supply partners, the feedback from customers, her thought process, and how she wants to build and scale this business, we found it very inspiring.”

Pronto is not the only startup connecting domestic workers with consumers. Lightspeed Venture Partners recently backed Snabbit, and IPO-bound Urban Company also offers a similar service.

Garg told TechCrunch that India has 180–190 million nuclear families who are potential customers for household services, and a semi-skilled and unskilled workforce of 35 million that could tap a $35 billion cumulative wage pool in this space.

“Whichever way you look at the market, this is large enough for multiple players to build an endurable business,” he said.

Expansion plans

Pronto now has six hubs in Gurugram, a satellite city of New Delhi, up from two in May. Each of these hubs serves customers within 1.5 miles.

The startup initially met 70% to 80% of demand from within 500 meters of households, as its first two hubs were located in densely populated residential areas. It has now set up hubs at intersections so its workers can reach multiple smaller, spread-out sectors quickly.

Pronto’s primary customers are working professionals, and it is seeing high demand. “Household help is very prevalent in India. And therefore, these are use cases where demand is quite concentrated, even in small catchment areas,” Garg said.

The startup now plans to expand both within Gurugram and into new markets, including Mumbai, Bengaluru, and other major cities, in the next 12–18 months.

Also joining the existing batch of Cosmos world models are Cosmos Transfer-2, which can accelerate synthetic data generation from 3D simulation scenes or spatial control inputs, and a distilled version of Cosmos Transfers that is more optimized for speed.

During its announcement at the SIGGRAPH conference on Monday, Nvidia noted that these models are meant to be used to create synthetic text, image, and video datasets for training robots and AI agents.

Cosmos Reason, per Nvidia, allows robots and AI agents to “reason” thanks to its memory and physics understanding, which lets it “serve as a planning model to reason what steps an embodied agent might take next.” The company says it can be used for data curation, robot planning, and video analytics.

The company also unveiled new neural reconstruction libraries, which includes one for a rendering technique that lets developers simulate the real world in 3D using sensor data. This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There’s even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.

There are new servers for robotics workflows, too. The Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell Server offers a single architecture for robotic development workloads, while Nvidia DGX Cloud is a cloud-based management platform.

These announcements come as the semiconductor giant is pushing further into robotics as it looks toward the next big use case for its AI GPUs beyond AI data centers.

“Once it became clear that all paths converged to AI6, I had to shut down Dojo and make some tough personnel choices, as Dojo 2 was now an evolutionary dead end,” Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, on Sunday. “Dojo 3 arguably lives on in the form of a large number of AI6 [systems-on-a-chip] on a single board.”

After bringing its first Dojo supercomputer to life and powering it with a mix of Nvidia GPUs and in-house-made D1 chips, Tesla had planned to build a second Dojo factory — referred to by Musk as “Dojo 2” — that would have been powered by a second-generation D2 chip.

It appears the D2 chip under development has been shelved along with the broader Dojo project as Tesla shifts its focus to its AI5 and AI6 chips, which are being manufactured by TSMC and Samsung, respectively. The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla’s driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.

“It doesn’t make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”

He added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.”

“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.

Musk has talked about Dojo since 2019, reiterating that Dojo would be a cornerstone of Tesla’s mission to achieve full self-driving and commercialize humanoid robots. Talk of Dojo halted around August 2024 when Musk began touting Cortex instead, a “giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.”

It’s not clear if Cortex is still in the works. TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla to learn more, as well as to inquire about the fate of the Dojo facility Tesla had invested $500 million to build in Buffalo, New York.

The shift in strategy comes at a time when Tesla is experiencing falling EV sales and significant brand damage after Musk’s forays into politics. Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.

As the new software gets closer to its September public launch date, the changes and tweaks aren’t as significant, but there are still some surprises to be found. In beta 6, that includes a new selection of ringtones, a final decision on the Camera swiping direction controversy, a new onboarding experience, and other updates.

The addition of half a dozen new ringtones, all a variant of the “reflection” tune, was an unexpected addition that’s already getting attention on social media. Early adopters are particularly enthused about the “Dreamer” ringtone, which has been described as going “hard,” “crazy good,” and “such a bop,” among other things. It might even encourage some to take their phones out of silent mode for a change.

Apple had no business going THIS HARD with the new ""Dreamer"" ringtone!! 🔥

Also new in iOS 26 beta 6 is a new update on the controversial change to the Camera app.

There was quite a bit of backlash over the way Apple changed how the Camera mode switcher responds to touch. Users complained that the change, introduced in prior betas, broke their muscle memory, since the swipe gesture on this interface would reverse the scroll direction they were used to — which was the same design paradigm that all other native Apple apps use. In beta 5, Apple responded to these complaints by introducing a new Settings toggle that would allow you to switch back to “Classic Mode,” which would once again make the Camera app work like all others.

It wouldn’t have been surprising for Apple to go this route. When it wants to make a major user interface change, it often adds a fallback for those who don’t like the update. That’s why you can still toggle off “Natural scrolling” on the MacBook’s Trackpad, and you can move Safari’s address bar back to the top of the screen on iPhone. But in this case, Apple seems to have decided the Camera direction isn’t a fight worth having. In beta 6, it removed the Settings toggle and changed the scroll direction back to the way it was before.

Other notable updates in the new beta include faster transitions and the introduction of new open and close animations for launching apps.

Quite a few small, but noticeable tweaks to animations in iOS 26 Beta 6! Most transitions are (even) faster, snappier.

Liquid Glass, the updated user interface for Apple devices, is also still being subtly tweaked for readability in some areas and more “glassiness” in others. This time, the changes have added more color dispersion as you move between an app’s tabs using the clear, magnifying glass-like selector. The Lock Screen and toggles also now offer Liquid Glass effects.

As with other beta releases, you can expect some bug fixes, but you may come across new ones as Apple moves forward with the software development process. However, users report that overall, this beta feels more stable and much faster than prior releases, suggesting that Apple is nearing its public launch.

Now that the developer beta has been released, those testing the public beta should expect an update soon.

4,techcrunch.com,https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/ford-throws-out-henry-fords-assembly-line-to-make-low-cost-evs-in-america/,Ford throws out Henry Ford’s assembly line to make low-cost EVs in America,2025-08-11T00:00:00,"Ford said Monday it will invest $2 billion to transform its Louisville Assembly Plant into a factory capable of making a new generation of affordable EVs, starting with a mid-sized pickup truck with a base price of $30,000 that is slated to launch in 2027.

This is not a standard factory upgrade. To reduce the cost of manufacturing, Ford has upended the moving assembly line system launched by its founder Henry Ford more than 112 years ago.

The automaker’s willingness to change the century-old system that made Ford a household name reflects the high-stakes juggling act of selling a line of affordable electric vehicles that could be made in the United States faster, more efficiently, and with fewer parts, all while preserving profit margins. And as Ford’s chief EV, digital, and design officer Doug Field noted Monday, it’s not just about driving down individual costs, but a change that will allow the automaker to compete with China.

Ford CEO Jim Farley described the new production system, line of EVs, and $2 billion investment as a bet.

“There are no guarantees with this project,” he said during an event livestreamed from the Kentucky plant. “We’re doing so many new things I can’t tell you with 100% uncertainty that this will all go just right, it is a bet. There is risk.”

It’s a bet Farley believes is worth making. The company’s EV division posted a loss of around $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2025 and sales of its top two EVs, the F-150 Lightning and the Mustang Mach-E, are falling.

And it’s a bet that began several years ago with a skunkworks team of about 500 people in California — led by former Tesla executive Alan Clarke and filled with talent from companies like Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. The team, which is split between Palo Alto and a new office in Long Beach, developed the new production system and underlying vehicle platform that will be used in the Louisville factory.

The end result is what Ford calls the “universal production system,” which changes its single conveyor line into a three-branched assembly tree. Ford has also developed a universal EV platform that will use lithium iron phosphate batteries using tech licensed from China’s CATL and manufactured at its new $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park factory in Michigan. That factory, which is expected to come online in 2026, will employ 1,700 hourly workers.

The new EV platform will consist of large single-piece aluminum unicastings that use far fewer parts and will allow the front and rear of the vehicle to be assembled separately on two of the branches. The third branch is perhaps most notable; this is where the structural battery will be assembled with seats, consoles, and carpeting. The three components will come together at the end of the line to form the vehicle.

The end result is an EV that has 20% fewer parts, including 50% fewer cooling hoses and connections, and 25% fewer fasteners, according to Ford. The first EV off the line will be a mid-sized pickup that is about the same size as a Ford Maverick, but roomier on the inside.

Unlike a traditional assembly line, where the workers move along adding the wire harness and other parts to the frame, the EV platform will consist of three kits. Within that kit, all fasteners, scanners, and power tools required for the job are included — and in the correct orientation for use, according to Ford. The system also reduces the number of dock stations by 40%.

The EV platform will be produced 15% faster, the company said.

“I’ve certainly never seen anything in the public domain that looks anything like this,” Clarke told TechCrunch in an interview ahead of the launch. “And I think that a manufacturing expert would look at this, and especially if they’ve been in the automotive industry for a few decades, would sort of scoff at it and say, ‘why would you do it this way?’”

Clarke is convinced that once manufacturing experts see how quickly a vehicle can go from start to finish, others will attempt to emulate this.

The new format and accompanying EV platform will change how the Louisville factory operates and reduce the number of workers employed there. The transformation will likely ripple through the broader supply chain as well. Ultimately, Clarke says, this will preserve American jobs.

Ford employs about 2,808 hourly workers at its Louisville assembly plant, which makes the Ford Escape and Lincoln Cosair. Production of those two vehicles will continue at the plant through the end of this year, before Ford begins retooling the factory and switching to the new family of EVs. Eventually, the plant will support 2,200 hourly workers — 600 fewer than today.

A Ford spokesperson said the automaker has offered a special retirement incentive program for workers. If fewer than 600 workers take the early retirement offer, they will be offered roles at other facilities.

Fewer workers and a “significant” increase in automation might typically prompt protests from the United Auto Workers. But Clarke says Ford worked with the UAW closely from the beginning and that there is “buy in.”

“The teams are really excited about what’s coming because they know that we have to be competitive and we have to make money from this project for jobs to stay in America,” he said, later adding, “This isn’t really, you know, optional.”

Several UAW representatives spoke during the event and supported the change, which they said will reduce the twisting, turning, and bending required of assembly workers and improve safety.

“Ergonomics has been taken into it a whole lot more,” Brandon Reisinger, UAW chairperson of the Louisville assembly plant, said at the event. “We should have a healthier workforce. Should be able to go home to your families and not be sore at the end of the day, which is going to be great.”

A coalition of states sued over the funding freeze in the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which was one of the administration’s many attempts to stop funding appropriated by Congress at the start of Donald Trump’s second term. A judge ruled in June that those states were likely to succeed and issued an injunction against the administration’s spending freeze.

The Department of Transportation (DOT), led by former MTV personality Sean Duffy, has criticized the states for taking too long to spend the money. As of May, around 84% of the $5 billion (authorized as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law) was still waiting to be obligated and only a few dozen chargers had been built.

Duffy and the DOT also claimed the funding was only halted while a “review process” was performed to ensure the NEVI program aligned with the administration’s priorities. A new press release issued Monday reveals what that entails.

Unsurprisingly, the new guidance focuses on simplifying the review process for the charging stations. This means states will no longer have to consider consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, and other previously required steps before construction can begin. The DOT has also removed requirements that a certain percentage of the charging stations be built in rural, underserved, or disadvantaged communities.

The DOT further removed language from the guidance requiring that proposals for the funding “demonstrate how the implementation will promote strong labor, safety training, and installation standards.” And the DOT struck language that required applicants to provide opportunities for minority- and women-owned small businesses to become involved.

1,techcrunch.com,https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/11/slow-ventures-cuts-first-check-from-60m-creator-fund-into-woodworking-founder/,Slow Ventures cuts first check from $60M creator fund into woodworking founder,2025-08-11T00:00:00,"Slow Ventures’ Creator Fund has invested $2 million into Jonathan Katz-Moses, a popular woodworking content creator with around 600,000 followers, nearly 75 million video views, and his own line of woodworking tools.

This marks the first investment for Slow’s $60 million Creator Fund since its launch in February. The fund looks to help creators launch businesses, under the belief that what made them successful influencers is what can also make them a good founder.

Speaking to TechCrunch, Slow Ventures partner Billy Parks, the lead investor on the deal, said the role of creators has greatly changed in the past decade or so, from creators mainly focused on media and brand dollars to those now focused on building real, “off-platform,” businesses.

“The pandemic accelerated direct-to-consumer growth for many. But the real signal is in the ones who’ve maintained and grown past that boom, which shows they can build something lasting and sustainable,” Parks said.

He said a good creator-founder thinks like an entrepreneur, “not chasing fame but building real businesses that they own and control.”

This is where Katz-Moses came in. His videos help teach woodworking, and he’s since expanded into selling his own tools and accessories to his audience. He has a team helping with business development, operations, and of course, creating YouTube content. Slow’s investment will help support the business and other content creation endeavors.

Katz-Moses went into woodworking after being violently assaulted one night in 2010. In a video posted to his channel recently, he recounted the story, saying he woke up in a pool of blood, surrounded by police officers and paramedics, gasping at his marred appearance. His injuries were severe: A broken eye socket and gashes needed 80 stitches. He said it was the happiest moment of his life because, at the very least, he was alive.

Shortly after that, he went into woodworking, deciding it was time to chase his dreams and leave behind anything unfulfilling. He bought a camera and started posting his creations to YouTube, amassing a loyal following in the process. But as his business and persona grew, he found himself facing the common challenges founders face, such as inventory management for his tools business and paying himself a salary.

Katz-Moses was one of 700 applicants to Slow’s Creator Fund and told TechCrunch it was exciting when Parks reached out to learn more about his business.

“Billy Parks from Slow reached out to me in March to let me know he’d like to meet,” Katz-Moses told TechCrunch.

“When we visited him in his 30,000-square-foot shop in Santa Barbara, we were blown away by his serious and long-term commitment to the brand and building a scaled business,” Parks told TechCrunch about why Slow picked Katz-Moses.

Parks said Slow wants to partner with creators early in their journeys so it can give them support when it will have the most impact in helping them grow. (It’s already made deals with a few creators, independent of this fund.)

Slow’s Creator fund is a showcase of how firms are looking to invest more in the Creator economy and find ways to work with influencers, as such creators become new business mavens. (Other creators have looked to raising venture capital to support their careers, as well as their peers.)

Parks said Slow wants to work with creators that operate in clearly defined spaces, rather than broad entertainment, teaming up with those with an engaged community and authority in their craft. “That combination makes for businesses with strong foundations and durable growth,” Parks continued. It’s not unlike how investors already vet their founders.

Since the investment, Katz-Moses has hired product developers, filed patent applications, looked at new products to build, and is hoping to share more educational content around woodworking. “The goal is to post across all major platforms,” he said. “But our primary focus will always be YouTube.”

This type of robbery is enjoying a new wave of popularity, and it is much harder to spot given how quickly those transactions take place. But how much risk is there, really? And how can you protect yourself from POS scams?

The Case of Sorrento

A recent example of POS theft happened recently in Italy. The news agency Ansa reported an arrest made in Sorrento after someone attempted to steal €100 from a cash register in a bar in the city center. During the search, law enforcement allegedly found a modified portable POS terminal.

It wasn't the first time the alleged thief had been stopped with such a device; Ansa reports that they had been arrested previously in Rome. The device shown in the photos circulated by the media appears to be a SumUp Solo, or a portable POS capable of operating independently without being connected to a smartphone. It is a popular type of device in stalls and markets, given its affordability and ease of use.

This is also not the first time robbers with tech equipment have been arrested. In fact, last year Ansa reported on a similar case occurring at a highway rest stop.

Difficult, but Not Impossible

There are two possible modus operandi for this type of scam. The first is the more convenient one for the robbers: They steal a wallet and, at a later time, make a series of small transactions with a stolen card that do not require entering the PIN, as if to simulate a series of short-term purchases. When the limit is reached, the wallet is thrown away.

The second method can be described as a kind of trawling. Thieves choose crowded places with high densities of people likely to come in contact with one another, such as public transportation or lines in commercial establishments. They then proceed to create a payment request on a portable POS, hold it in their hands or hide it in some way, and place it in the back pockets of pants, bags, fanny packs, backpacks, and so on.

The success rate is very low due to a number of factors. The first is that it takes about 30 seconds to receive confirmation of the transaction, before the request must be repeated from the POS. The second is that the POS must be almost in contact with the card, usually within 0.5 to 4 centimeters. The third is that there must be no interfering elements, such as other cards. Therefore, the robber must encounter a series of fortuitous circumstances to be successful. While the rate of success is very low, it is not zero, so it is best to limit your risk as much as possible. Here are some tips.

How to Defend Yourself

It goes without saying that if you stick your wallet in the back pocket of your pants in plain view, you not only risk being robbed in the traditional way, but you also create the best scenario for this newer scam. You can opt for wallets with integrated RFID protection, which create a real barrier to these types of scams.

For maximum protection, you can receive notifications even for small contactless transactions through your bank's app settings. Fraudsters typically choose small amounts, trusting that the victim will not receive notifications—often the victim may not notice the amount being withdrawn, perhaps confusing it with other small transactions. If you fall for the scam, it's advisable to contact your bank immediately to dispute the transactions: Since everything is traceable, it's possible to identify the device used by the fraudsters, although they may have switched to a new one in the meantime.

Finally, almost all modern smartphones are now equipped with an NFC chip for contactless payments. Thefts using portable POS terminals can often be prevented by the fact that the smartphone must be unlocked, so even if someone places a POS terminal on the unattended phone, no transaction takes place.

The coding-equals-prosperity promise has officially collapsed.

Fresh computer science graduates are facing unemployment rates of 6.1% to 7.5% — more than double what biology and art history majors are experiencing, according to a recent Federal Reserve Bank of New York study. A crushing New York Times piece highlights what’s happening on the ground.

The individual stories are surreal. Manasi Mishra, 21, graduated from Purdue after being promised six-figure starting salaries, only to receive a single interview, at Chipotle (she didn’t get the job.) Zach Taylor has applied to nearly 6,000 tech jobs since graduating from Oregon State in 2023, landing just 13 interviews and zero offers. He was even rejected by McDonald’s for “lack of experience.”

The alleged culprits? AI programming tools that are eliminating junior positions, while big names like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft slash jobs. Students say they’re trapped in an “AI doom loop” — using AI to mass-apply while companies use AI to auto-reject them, sometimes within minutes.

Thankfully, Mishra landed a job after a cold application worked out, helped along by some savvy TikTok posts about the borked job market.

Mark Zuckerberg has spent 14 years gobbling up his leafy Palo Alto neighborhood, according to a New York Times report that details how the Meta CEO has purchased 11 properties for over $110 million to create his own personal fiefdom in Crescent Park.

The piecemeal compound features a main residence, guest homes, manicured gardens, and a pickleball court — even a pool with a movable hydrofloor that can turn the swimming area into a dance floor. The pièce de résistance: a seven-foot statue of wife Priscilla Chan draped in flowing silver robes.

Beneath his suburban stronghold lies 7,000 square feet of subterranean space that neighbors have dubbed “the billionaire bat cave.” A private school for 14 children also operates in one of the homes — a violation of city zoning codes that doesn’t seem to bother city officials, reports the Times.

The whole operation has taken a toll on some longtime residents, who cite years of construction noise, blocked driveways, and surveillance cameras peering every which way. Neighbor Michael Kieschnick tells the outlet, “No neighborhood wants to be occupied, but that’s exactly what they’ve done.”

Eaton Zveare, who works as a security researcher at software delivery company Harness, told TechCrunch the flaw he discovered allowed the creation of an admin account that granted “unfettered access” to the unnamed carmaker’s centralized web portal.

With this access, a malicious hacker could have viewed the personal and financial data of the carmaker’s customers, tracked vehicles, and enrolled customers in features that allow owners — or the hackers — to control some of their cars’ functions from anywhere.

Zveare said he doesn’t plan on naming the vendor, but said it was a widely known automaker with several popular sub-brands.

In an interview with TechCrunch ahead of his talk at the Def Con security conference in Las Vegas on Sunday, Zveare said the bugs put a spotlight on the security of these dealership systems, which grant their employees and associates broad access to customer and vehicle information.

Zveare, who has found bugs in carmakers’ customer systems and vehicle management systems before, found the flaw earlier this year as part of a weekend project, he told TechCrunch.

He said while the security flaws in the portal’s login system was a challenge to find, once he found it, the bugs let him bypass the login mechanism altogether by permitting him to create a new “national admin” account.

The flaws were problematic because the buggy code loaded in the user’s browser when opening the portal’s login page, allowing the user — in this case, Zveare — to modify the code to bypass the login security checks. Zveare told TechCrunch that the carmaker found no evidence of past exploitation, suggesting he was the first to find it and report it to the carmaker.

When logged in, the account granted access to more than 1,000 of the carmakers’ dealers across the United States, he told TechCrunch.

“No one even knows that you’re just silently looking at all of these dealers’ data, all their financials, all their private stuff, all their leads,” said Zveare, in describing the access.

Zveare said one of the things he found inside the dealership portal was a national consumer lookup tool that allowed logged-in portal users to look up the vehicle and driver data of that carmaker.

In one real-world example, Zveare took a vehicle’s unique identification number from the windshield of a car in a public parking lot and used the number to identify the car’s owner. Zveare said the tool could be used to look up someone using only a customer’s first and last name.

With access to the portal, Zveare said it was also possible to pair any vehicle with a mobile account, which allows customers to remotely control some of their cars’ functions from an app, such as unlocking their cars.

Zveare said he tried this out in a real-world example using a friend’s account and with their consent. In transferring ownership to an account controlled by Zveare, he said the portal requires only an attestation — effectively a pinky promise — that the user performing the account transfer is legitimate.

“For my purposes, I just got a friend who consented to me taking over their car, and I ran with that,” Zveare told TechCrunch. “But [the portal] could basically do that to anyone just by knowing their name — which kind of freaks me out a bit — or I could just look up a car in the parking lots.”

Zveare said he did not test whether he could drive away, but said the exploit could be abused by thieves to break into and steal items from vehicles, for example.

Another key problem with access to this carmaker’s portal was that it was possible to access other dealer’s systems linked to the same portal through single sign-on, a feature that allows users to log in to multiple systems or applications with just one set of login credentials. Zveare said the carmaker’s systems for dealers are all interconnected so it’s easy to jump from one system to another.

With this, he said, the portal also had a feature that allowed admins, such as the user account he created, to “impersonate” other users, effectively allowing access to other dealer systems as if they were that user without needing their logins. Zveare said this was similar to a feature found in a Toyota dealer portal discovered in 2023.

“They’re just security nightmares waiting to happen,” said Zveare, speaking of the user-impersonation feature.

Once in the portal Zveare found personally identifiable customer data, some financial information, and telematics systems that allowed the real-time location tracking of rental or courtesy cars, as well as cars being shipped across the country, and the option to cancel them — though, Zveare didn’t try.

Zveare said the bugs took about a week to fix in February 2025 soon after his disclosure to the carmaker.

“The takeaway is that only two simple API vulnerabilities blasted the doors open, and it’s always related to authentication,” said Zveare. “If you’re going to get those wrong, then everything just falls down.”

Actually not. But last fall I went to an event for Worldcoin, which is Sam Altman's other company. It was a super weird vibey crypto eye-scanning thing at a warehouse in the Mission District of San Francisco.

Michael Calore: The orb?

Lauren Goode: This party had everything. Yeah. But there was swag there and there was a really nice sweatshirt that had World emblazoned on it, and I looked at the label and it's by a company called Original Favorites, and so I ordered one. So I have the Sam Altman Worldcoin sweatshirt without the World logo on it. I'm showing it to you right now.

Michael Calore: Yeah. This is what you're wearing.

Lauren Goode: And I love this sweatshirt. It is like in the '90s when you used to buy sweatshirts and they were so rough and tough, they almost felt like cardboard?

Michael Calore: Yes.

Lauren Goode: Like good old Champion sweatshirts, you know what I mean?

Michael Calore: Yes.

Lauren Goode: That feeling. And you'd wash it a hundred times and it would still have that ... This is what this is.

Michael Calore: It looks fabulous.

Lauren Goode: Thank you.

Michael Calore: Congratulations.

Lauren Goode: Mike, what's your recommendation?

Michael Calore: Oh, gosh. I'm going to recommend some stand-up comedy for our times.

Lauren Goode: Do it.

Michael Calore: It's the new Marc Maron stand-up special that's on HBO. It came out a week ago or so. It's called Panicked and it is quite good. In particular, I'm recommending it because there's a fantastic riff, like right in the middle, a whole bit about the app Watch Duty, which is the app that people use to track wildfires and became very popular in Los Angeles at the beginning of 2025 when LA was devastated by all of the wildfires. Well, Marc tells the story about how he had Watch Duty and he could not understand the notifications in the app, and he didn't know whether or not he should evacuate, so he grabbed all of his cats and evacuated and just absolutely did not need to. And it's this really fun long story, but it's also just very good. The whole thing is very good. If you're familiar with Marc Maron's comedy, you'll know that he's very dark and this special does get very dark, particularly in the second half, but I can highly recommend it. If you know him and you like him, you will love it.

Lauren Goode: Adding it to the watch list.

Michael Calore: Great.

Lauren Goode: Adding it to Watch Duty. Our guy, Boone Ashworth, who used to produce this show for us, he wrote a feature story this year about Watch Duty, too.

Michael Calore: He did. He did.

Lauren Goode: So we'll include that in the show notes.

Michael Calore: Yes.

Lauren Goode: And Mike, you're never leaving us again, right? No more vacations for you ever?

Michael Calore: Never ever.

Lauren Goode: Thank God.

Michael Calore: I'll be sitting here behind the microphone until the end of time.

Lauren Goode: The best chatbot there is.

They've warned that a single lawsuit raised by three authors over Anthropic's AI training now threatens to ""financially ruin"" the entire AI industry if up to 7 million claimants end up joining the litigation and forcing a settlement.

Last week, Anthropic petitioned to appeal the class certification, urging the court to weigh questions that the district court judge, William Alsup, seemingly did not. Alsup allegedly failed to conduct a ""rigorous analysis"" of the potential class and instead based his judgment on his ""50 years"" of experience, Anthropic said.

If the appeals court denies the petition, Anthropic argued, the emerging company may be doomed. As Anthropic argued, it now ""faces hundreds of billions of dollars in potential damages liability at trial in four months"" based on a class certification rushed at ""warp speed"" that involves ""up to seven million potential claimants, whose works span a century of publishing history,"" each possibly triggering a $150,000 fine.

Confronted with such extreme potential damages, Anthropic may lose its rights to raise valid defenses of its AI training, deciding it would be more prudent to settle, the company argued. And that could set an alarming precedent, considering all the other lawsuits generative AI (GenAI) companies face over training on copyrighted materials, Anthropic argued.

""One district court's errors should not be allowed to decide the fate of a transformational GenAI company like Anthropic or so heavily influence the future of the GenAI industry generally,"" Anthropic wrote. ""This Court can and should intervene now.""

In a court filing Thursday, the Consumer Technology Association and the Computer and Communications Industry Association backed Anthropic, warning the appeals court that ""the district court’s erroneous class certification"" would threaten ""immense harm not only to a single AI company, but to the entire fledgling AI industry and to America’s global technological competitiveness.""",,,"industry, potential, genai, district, court, company, class, horrified, copyright, certified, anthropic, largest, training, ai, action, face",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:28.604436+00:00,1babe99e43b63fc9cc12b4a796a99d2e748c0a43c2820456f461dc5bf687d30b
217,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/figma-ipo-dylan-field-interview/,Inside Dylan Field’s Big IPO—and His Even Bigger Plans for Figma,2025-08-08T15:00:00+00:00,"When Dylan Field pops up on my Zoom screen, his face is a mixture of giddiness and fatigue. He’s back at work, after a whirlwind trip to New York City where he launched his company Figma on the New York Stock Exchange, bucking the trend of multi-billion-dollar startups staying private. Even before it became clear that this might be the wildest public launch in years, the Figma world—fans of the app, employees (known as Figmates), and investors—had already turned Wall Street into a block party, handing out swag, serving free pizza, and blasting music from a DJ that shook the caverns of mammon. But the sweetest music played out on the Big Board, as the opening $33 share price skyrocketed to $142 before settling down at a comfortable $90.

By the time Field flew back to California, he was worth more than $5 billion. But he doesn’t want to talk about that. The story, in his mind, is not about a company going public, but the IPO of design itself. “What I care most about is what our product will be in 5 years, 10 years,” he says. “Are we progressing design forward?”

Not focusing on the money is probably a good idea. On the day we are speaking, Figma’s stock price dropped 27 percent, cutting its valuation from around $60 billion to just over $40 billion. That’s still way higher than anyone expected. While Figma’s IPO celebrates design, it isn’t the only company hoping to revolutionize the field. AI will initiate a new era in design. Figma, like its competitors, will be defined by how it handles that technology. Ultimately, it’s still not clear whether AI will help its business or blow it up.

Field Work

Every time I talk to Field, it seems like something monumental is happening to Figma, the company he cofounded as a 19-year-old Thiel fellow and a dropout from Brown University. From the start, Figma’s browser-based app allowed people to collaborate and brainstorm about design online. It grew a loyal following, threatening the giant in design tools, Adobe. During our first meeting in 2022, I pressed Field on that David and Goliath trope—and whether he might pull an Instagram and sell out to a bigger company. Field nobly talked about how he was in it for the long haul. In fact, he had a secret he couldn’t share: Adobe had just offered $20 billion for his company, and he was going to take it. The news broke weeks after our conversation. When I confronted him about that at the WIRED conference in San Francisco last December, he apologized. “I felt so bad about that,” he told me.

The next time we talked, in December 2023, that deal had just fallen apart, because former President Joe Biden’s Department of Justice indicated it would object to the merger. Field was clearly shaken but determined to carry on with his original plan to build a company that would change the way people create apps, websites, docs, and decks. It wasn’t easy, as months of momentum had been squandered preparing to merge with the bigger firm.

Over the next two years, Figma expanded its offerings and kept winning fans. Its 13 million users only hint at its ubiquity: work produced on its app is seen by billions of people. Among Fortune 500 companies, 95 percent use the product. Figma turns a profit. And post-IPO, even after its stock leveled off, the company is worth more than twice what Adobe was going to pay for it.

Still, I was a bit baffled that Field felt it necessary to IPO when startups these days can reach stratospheric valuations without the mishigas of accountability that comes from becoming a public firm. Field cites the virtues of community ownership, the corporate hygiene of following the reporting rules, and how the option to buy shares in Figma will lead people to understand its business better. Ultimately, he says, “If you’re going to go public eventually, why not do it now?”

Design or Lose

As is custom for many tech leaders going public, Field wrote a founder’s letter in the prospectus in which he pledged higher values than profits. (Those vows typically wind up haunting their authors as the scrappy entrepreneurs morph into yacht-seeking profit-hounds.) Essentially, the letter is an argument that design now has a central place in peoples’ lives. It’s not just an important factor in the way people build products and express themselves: it’s the factor. “Design,” he wrote, “is bigger than design.” When I ask what he meant by that, he doesn’t unpack the koan too easily. “It’s something that can mean a lot of things,” he says. “It’s the rise of design going from pixel level craft to more general problem solving, to how you win or lose.”

He explains that in the early 2000s, design was about making things pretty. By the 2010s, people were emulating Steve Jobs’ philosophy that design was about function. Now, Field says, design is not only both those things, but our means of communication—who you are, what your brand stands for, how you engage with the public. Our world is built on software, Field says, and the more software is created, the more design becomes the core differentiator. It’s our new language, and Figma wants to be the Duolingo for those striving to master it.",,"Steven Levy, Veronique Greenwood, Kylie Robison, Reece Rogers, Aarian Marshall, Makena Kelly, Kate Knibbs, Jake Lahut","dylan, field, things, ipoand, stock, fields, design, plans, figma, inside, going, way, billion, public, bigger, company, big",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:22.174149+00:00,03124fc91824c198f8706515ec3e61cc0ef503978c534f1e046a5da58cfd3188

You’ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected — and sometimes disrespectful — judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?

A pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I’m an entrepreneur and investor, and I’ve spent a decade doing casting for “Shark Tank” and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.

I hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest — won by Dutch startup Tap Electric — captured what can make a founder’s story stand out. Whether you’re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:

Nerves

Yes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn’t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something — before, during, and after.

Entrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.

Research

A successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges’ backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can “do the most” with the funding or resources provided.

Don’t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business

Whatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.

Start by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.

Lastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.

What do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?

Audience

Connect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.

Invite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links — all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.

Internalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you’re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection – eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel — makes your message resonate.

Ask

You would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.

Don’t leave the most important part as a surprise — always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.

If the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.

As is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.

Content

A good pitch isn’t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.

Treat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!

Record your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence “elevator pitch” and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.

Write a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience — what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained. Keep your community updated: this visibility can attract customers, partners, and even future investors. Leverage social media and other channels to amplify your story.

A winning pitch is built on preparation, clarity, and connection. Research your judges, tell a crisp story, engage your audience, get specific about the resources and go-to-market strategy, make a confident and relevant ask, and then turn that one presentation into many pieces of compelling content.

These elements work together to make your pitch memorable and effective. A pitch including them can supercharge a business and accelerate your path towards growth.",,"Brandon Andrews, Story By","mean, tank, shark, insider, judges, competition, lessons, audience, business, pro, resources, pitch, ask, market, moment",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:20.561091+00:00,ebc86269733a28b7dc25f62e5dd93c38b4258c905a1b9c024e49aee3ae02510c

They also asked Altman about the most embarrassing — and perhaps funniest — snafu in the presentation, the “chart crime.”

One of the new features that GPT-5 rolled out is a real-time router that decides which model to use for a particular prompt, either responding quickly or taking additional time to “think” through answers.

But multiple people in the AMA on the r/ChatGPT Reddit complained GPT-5 wasn’t working as well for them as 4o did. Altman said the reason GPT-5 seemed “dumber” was the router wasn’t working properly when it was rolled out Thursday.

“GPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,” Altman promised.

Still, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. “We are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,” he wrote.

And Altman also promised, “We are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.” This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.

Predictably, he was also asked about the wildly inaccurate chart the team presented during the live presentation that quickly became the butt of many “chart crime” jokes. The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar.

Altman didn’t answer questions about the chart during the AMA, but on Thursday he did call the chart a “mega chart screwup” on X. Others noted the charts in the published blog post were correct.

But the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation. GPT-5 reviewer Simon Willison, who had early access and generally liked the model’s performance, also pointed out that turning data into a table was “good example of a GPT-5 failure.”

In any case, Altman promised fixes to the items that seemed to concern people the most. He ended the AMA with a promise: “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback.”",,"Julie Bort, Venture Editor, Maxwell Zeff, Sarah Perez, Aria Alamalhodaei, Zack Whittaker, Connie Loizos, --C-Author-Card-Image-Size Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var, Media, Min-Width","bringing, gpt5, chart, promised, tech, ama, model, rollout, addresses, sam, bumpy, altman, crime, 2025, 4o, disrupt, agenda",pending,2025-08-15T23:50:20.474297+00:00,a4276989edc07b457c7f06fc57dd9672d8dc43a7e69fa30ed6d45cb3386d9200

The jury’s still out on early 2024’s Framework Laptop 16 and mid-2025’s Framework Laptop 12, neither of which has seen a hardware refresh, but so far, the company has released half a dozen iterations of its flagship Framework Laptop 13 in less than five years. If you bought one of the originals right when it first launched, you could go to Framework’s site, buy an all-new motherboard and RAM, and get a substantial upgrade in performance and other capabilities without having to change anything else about your laptop.

Framework’s laptops haven’t been adopted as industry-wide standards, but in many ways, they seem built to reflect the flexibility and modularity that has drawn me to desktop PCs for more than two decades.

That's what makes the Framework Desktop so weird. Not only is Framework navigating into a product category where its main innovation and claim to fame is totally unnecessary. But it’s actually doing that with a desktop that’s less upgradeable and modular than any given self-built desktop PC.

The Framework Desktop has a lot of interesting design touches, and it's automatically a better buy than the weird AMD Ryzen AI Max-based mini desktops you can buy from a couple of no-name manufacturers. But aside from being more considerate of PC industry standards, the Framework Desktop asks the same question that any gaming-focused mini PC does: Do you care about having a small machine so much that you would pay more money for less performance, and for a system you can't upgrade much after you buy it?

As sunshine bathes the leafy university campus, scientists inside the labs work under cool fluorescent light. Clad in green protective gear, they tend meticulously to test tubes within hermetically sealed cleanrooms. The containers hold the fruits of today’s labour: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

Each cell is barely a quarter the width of a human hair but wields remarkable power. MSCs reduce inflammation, repair damaged tissue, and modulate the immune system. They can treat chronic diseases and delay ageing. They may even prevent illness before it begins. But to become a mainstay of modern healthcare, MSCs must be produced at scale, affordably and reliably.

That seemed a distant prospect until recently, but the Karolinska scientists believe it’s approaching reality. They’re working for Cellcolabs, a Swedish startup formed to tackle the global scarcity of stem cell treatments.

Cellcolabs believes this shortage could soon be overcome. Thanks to a blend of scientific, regulatory, and technological advances, MSCs are edging towards the consumer market. Within the next decade, Cellcolabs aims to cut prices by up to 90%.

In the lab, the progress looks impressive. The latest harvest — cultivated from a single donation — has yielded 4.1 billion cells, enough for up to 200 standard doses.

Cellcolabs CEO Dr Mattias Bernow is in a buoyant mood. The 43-year-old sees today’s cultivation as just a taste of what’s to come.

“I truly believe that we’re at an inflection point in the history of medicine,” he says.

The power of MSCs

MSCs exist naturally in the body. A typical human contains billions of them. They act like a repair crew, fixing and tuning our insides. They can also be extracted, multiplied, and turned into medical treatments.

Karolinska was the site of one of the field’s biggest milestones. In 2012, its Nobel Assembly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka. They discovered that mature cells can be made pluripotent — able to become almost any cell type in the body. The breakthrough rewrote the rules of regenerative medicine, igniting fresh regulatory momentum and fast-tracking stem cell therapies.

MSCs are among the most promising examples. When injected, they release signals that trigger healing. The body then repairs itself.

They can treat countless conditions, from arthritis and heart disease to immune disorders. But first, you need to extract a small sample from a living, breathing human.

Cellcolabs sources its MSCs from the bone marrow of healthy donors aged 18 to 30. Just 50 millilitres — about a shot glass — produces up to 200 doses. The marrow naturally regenerates in six to eight weeks.

The donation process is quick and minimally invasive, but mass production is notoriously challenging. MSCs are living cells that require complex biomanufacturing, careful handling, and strict quality control, which makes scaling a formidable task.

Cellcolabs nonetheless sees industrial-scale production on the horizon — largely thanks to the pioneering research of Professor Katarina Le Blanc.

Le Blanc’s landmark work showed MSCs could combat inflammatory and immune diseases. Her findings also proved that donated cells were suitable for therapeutic use — a crucial step for commercialisation.

She helped establish clinical-grade production standards, paving the way for large-scale trials and broader therapeutic use. Her research laid the foundations for Bernow’s inflection point.

“This is not brain surgery or rocket science, but it is stem cells — so it’s quite close,” he says. “It’s super complex. And the only reason we can do this and move so fast is Professor Le Blanc’s research.”

As a haematologist, Le Blanc explored the potential of MSCs to support blood cancer patients. Her early clinical work focused on graft-versus-host disease — a severe and often fatal complication of bone marrow transplants. In a small trial, her team administered MSCs to patients who hadn’t responded to standard therapies. The impact was striking: more than half the participants survived. “The entire field just blew up,” says Bernow.

Le Blanc continued pushing into new territory. One trial repaired vocal folds, restoring speech with minimal scarring. Another study used MSCs in COVID-19 patients to reduce inflammation. The results were promising — but she hit a wall. “She ran out of cells,” Bernow says.

Scaling became a new focus. To expand treatment access, To expand treatment access, Le Blanc donated her research to Cellcolabs in 2021. Two years later, the Karolinska facility received production approval.

Production costs have fallen rapidly since then, fuelling hopes of a tenfold reduction. As prices drop and output scales, Bernow has his eyes on a target: “to truly democratise access to stem cells.”

A new world of treatments

Back in the lab, CPO Lina Sörvik leads a tour of the facilities. Previously a senior figure in big pharma, she joined Cellcolabs after being captivated by the potential of MSCs.

“I was inspired by what they could do and by the idea of setting up a facility to produce them,” she says.

On a harvest day, her team’s work begins at 7:00 AM. Scientists don full protective gear and spend the day working inside the Karolinska cleanrooms. Once they’ve harvested the MSCs, the cells are tested for quality and frozen for future use.

The range of their applications is extensive. Middle-aged patients can gain relief from joint pain and injuries. Athletes can accelerate their recovery from injuries. The elderly could slow their ageing.

Brian Johnson, a tech entrepreneur and celebrity longevity advocate, has also explored their powers. He had 300 million MSCs produced by Cellcolabs injected into his knees, shoulders, and hips.

Bernow lauds the variety of treatments. He says MSCs are interesting “for almost any indication.”

His path to them was winding. Raised in Malmö, southwestern Sweden, Bernow moved to the country’s capital to study at the Stockholm School of Economics (SSE).

“At that time, everybody wanted to become bankers in London,” he recalls. “That was not the future I saw for myself.”

He expanded his studies, earning a medical degree from Karolinska Institute and an MSc from SSE. After working as a clinical physician and management consultant, he co-founded Doctrin, a digital healthcare platform. Then Cellcolabs came calling: the leadership team needed a CEO and saw Bernow as a perfect fit.

“I knew it was going to be more blood, sweat, and tears,” he says. “But the more I read, the more fascinated I became.”

What fascinated him the most was the potential of MSCs to treat chronic conditions — the leading cause of death in the world. “That is why I think we’re truly at an inflection point in the history of medicine.”

The new antibiotics?

Bernow likes to share a quote from Joseph Martin, former Dean of Harvard Medical School: “Stem cell therapies have the potential to do for chronic diseases what antibiotics did for infectious diseases.”

It’s a bold comparison. Before Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, minor infections could be fatal. Healthy people died young or quickly aged.

A century later, antibiotics let us live longer, better lives. Infectious diseases are no longer the leading causes of death. They’ve been supplanted by chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and diabetes. We’re also now living with more age-related illnesses, which severely reduce quality of life.

MSCs, Bernow says, can help alleviate the growing burden of chronic illness. “But as a physician, what I find most interesting is the potential to prevent — or at least delay — the onset of disease.”

He recalls his time working in the ER, treating cardiac patients. A typical case was a middle-aged man who had just suffered his first cardiac event, now resigned to a lower quality and potentially shorter life. MSCs could have transformed that outcome.

Their regenerative and anti-inflammatory powers could support recovery — or even prevent the event altogether.

To reach this potential, Cellcolabs is targeting a new launchpad for scale: bioreactors.

Scaling for the future

Inside the Karolinska cleanrooms, Cellcolabs currently grows MSCs on flat surfaces in cell medium. Bioreactors offer a promising upgrade.

By vastly expanding cultivation surfaces and enabling automated, tightly controlled growth conditions, they could scale production far beyond what’s feasible with today’s methods.

Cellcolabs is developing its bioreactor platform with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. Bernow expects it to transform production, multiplying MSC output many times over.

Full-scale launch is slated for 2028. By then, Cellcolabs also hopes to have compelling new evidence for the benefits of MSCs.

The startup is currently involved in promising tests in the Bahamas and Abu Dhabi. Both locations have created progressive, patient-friendly, and ethically regulated frameworks for MSC trials, which have made them industry trailblazers.

Across their test sites, scientists are investigating treatments for a variety of conditions: musculoskeletal injuries, knee osteoarthritis, cardiovascular risk, arthritis, and age-related frailty.

In smaller territories such as these, it’s easier to update medical regulations for emerging therapies. If they’re successful, Bernow expects other nations to follow their lead and accelerate their support for MSCs. The potential benefits, he argues, are enormous.

He envisions the tiny cells shifting healthcare systems from reactive to preventative, cutting costs while tackling chronic conditions. Our lives wouldn’t just grow longer — they’d be healthier and happier.

Bernow draws a contrast with recent advances in Western medicine. We live longer, but our later years are often marred by frailty, illness, and a confined existence.

“We’ve added years with lower life quality,” he says. “If stem cells can delay chronic disease onset, we can start prolonging our healthy lifespan.”

That doesn’t mean, he adds, that MSCs will create a fountain of youth. They won’t expand our lives forever, but they dramatically improve the time we have.

203,theverge.com,https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/719409/nuclear-energy-uranium-enrichment-ai-data-center-electricity,AI could turn your town nuclear,2025-08-06T13:30:00+00:00,"These days, Paducah, Kentucky — population 27,000 and home to the National Quilt Museum — prides itself as “Quilt City.” But decades ago, it was also called the “Atomic City” — a moniker it could soon regain as AI’s energy needs bring Paducah’s nuclear past back to life.

The Department of Energy (DOE) operated a uranium enrichment plant in Paducah for more than 60 years until the plant shuttered in 2013 amid a downturn in nuclear energy. The same year, Paducah was designated a UNESCO “creative city” for its quilts, a title it now boasts on its website (along with a city-led initiative to make Paducah more “considerate and kind”).

Today, the enrichment facility is in the spotlight again after a Peter Thiel-backed startup announced plans to revive the shuttered plant. In July, Donald Trump’s administration also chose Paducah as one of four sites where it says it’ll partner with private companies to develop AI data centers and energy projects.

Big Tech — thirsty for enough electricity to power its AI ambitions — wants to make nuclear energy cool again. It’s all playing into the Trump administration’s plans to remake the US power grid without solar and wind power. If they manage to revitalize nuclear energy in America, the US is going to need more enriched uranium. And that supply chain could bring big changes to even small cities like Paducah.

Big Tech — thirsty for enough electricity to power its AI ambitions — wants to make nuclear energy cool again

At an August 5th event in Paducah, General Matter shared details about its vision for the facility. It says it’ll develop what it considers the “the nation’s first U.S.-owned, privately developed uranium enrichment facility” on the site and that it has signed “a multi-decade, one hundred-acre lease” with the DOE. General Matter plans to start enriching uranium in Paducah by the end of the decade and “produce the fuel needed for the next generation of nuclear energy, central to America’s aspirations in AI, manufacturing, and other critical industries,” according to a statement on X. (A DOE press release says enrichment operations aren’t planned until 2034, however, and that construction is slated to start in 2026.)

That doesn’t quite answer some key questions about the company’s plans. (General Matter didn’t respond to several emails from The Verge.) Will the company rely on the same outdated technology the shuttered plant has always used or build something new? If it does plan to revamp the facility with modern technology, does it plan to produce the same kind of low-enriched uranium that America’s existing nuclear reactors run on, or does it think it can be one of the first plants to produce more highly enriched uranium (called HALEU) for advanced reactors? The answers to those questions will define how ambitious of a project this really is, and the impact it could have on power grids across the US. The recent DOE press release notes that General Matter is one of four companies the agency selected in October of last year to provide enrichment services for HALEU, although the DOE also announced plans to contract General Matter for low-enriched uranium in December.

Enrichment is just one step, and kind of a headache, in the nuclear supply chain. Uranium first has to be mined and milled. Naturally occurring uranium has low levels of the isotope U-235 that nuclear fission reactors split to release energy. The uranium has to be converted into gas and then enriched to about a 5 percent concentration of U-235 to make fuel for a traditional reactor. Following a boom in nuclear power plants built in the 1970s and 1980s, however, the industry lost ground to gas-fired power plants generating electricity at lower costs. Nuclear reactors and uranium enrichment plants shuttered across the US.

But now, the opposite is happening. Microsoft and Meta have inked deals over the past year to revive old reactors. Other tech giants, including Amazon and Google, have committed to supporting companies designing advanced reactors that are supposed to be smaller, easier, and cheaper to build — potentially solving many of the problems that have plagued the nuclear energy industry for years, if they can eventually prove that these technologies are going to be able to perform at commercial scale.

That’s all driving up demand for uranium enrichment, now seen as a significant bottleneck in the nuclear energy supply chain. General Matter isn’t the only operation seeking to enrich uranium in Paducah. The DOE has had a deal with another company called Global Laser Enrichment (GLE) since 2016 to sell it leftover tails, depleted uranium, from years of enrichment for nuclear weapons and reactors at the site. GLE has been developing a new way to enrich uranium using lasers that’s supposed to be efficient enough to re-enrich uranium tails so that they can be used to make fuel again. General Matter similarly plans to re-enrich depleted uranium tails in Paducah, according to the DOE press release, although we still don’t know what kind of technology it will use to do so.

Laser technology has yet to be used to enrich uranium at commercial scale. Over the past decade, there just wasn’t enough demand for more uranium enrichment capacity in the US to move forward, says Nima Ashkeboussi, vice president of government relations and communications at GLE. Then Russia — a major supplier for nuclear fuel globally — invaded Ukraine, and in 2024, and the US barred imports of uranium from Russia. GLE applied for a license in June to finally start re-enriching the depleted uranium tails at a site adjacent to the Paducah plant, and expects to hear back from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in about 18 months.

If all goes well, GLE plans to have its facility up and running by 2030 so it can start making the low-enriched uranium traditionally used by existing nuclear reactors. If at least one of the advanced reactors makes it to commercial operation, Ashkeboussi says that’ll be a market signal that it can start producing more highly enriched uranium (called HALEU) that next-generation reactors need. For now, only Russia has the capability to commercially produce HALEU. But already, data centers and AI have been a major driver in reinvigorating nuclear energy, Ashkeboussi tells The Verge. “We see that as a huge growth potential,” he says.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations have worked toward onshoring the nuclear supply chain again. The US currently has the capacity to enrich about a third of the uranium its nuclear reactors need. For Joe Biden, nuclear energy supported US climate goals of slashing planet-heating pollution by transitioning away from fossil fuels in the power grid. Trump is sabotaging US climate commitments and renewable energy projects, but still says nuclear energy has a role to play when it comes to making sure US tech companies have enough electricity to dominate the AI market.

The plans for Paducah seem to fit neatly into the Trump administration’s vision for AI, which it released last month. In short, the plan includes fast-tracking the development of energy-hungry data centers in conjunction with primarily fossil fuel and nuclear power plants by limiting environmental reviews.

“It seems their mindset is construction and production at all costs.”

The rush to build, especially as the Trump administration simultaneously guts the Environmental Protection Agency and Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has raised some flags over how much oversight and community participation there will be with these new projects. “I don’t have any confidence in what the administration is doing to protect public health and safety. It seems their mindset is construction and production at all costs,” says Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists that has been critical of the environmental and security risks nuclear energy can pose.

Nuclear energy has been a divisive technology among people concerned about climate change and pollution. It’s a carbon pollution-free source of electricity. But uranium mining near the Grand Canyon has already sparked opposition from environmental advocates and the Havasupai Tribe over how it could affect nearby communities and the water sources on which they rely. And the federal government has yet to solve decades of wrangling over where to store radioactive waste from nuclear reactors.

Adding to those concerns, the Trump administration wants to build on federal lands and even repurpose polluted Superfund sites for all this infrastructure. The shuttered enrichment plant in Paducah itself is a Superfund site, which means it’s on a list of places so contaminated that the Environmental Protection Agency has stepped in to prioritize their cleanup. That legacy shows the pitfalls and hurdles that policymakers and companies will have to try to avoid if they want to bring nuclear energy back to small-town USA.

“Regardless of what’s happening with the Trump administration, this is a massively bipartisan undertaking regarding uranium enrichment. There is a lot of support for it right now. I think there’s a lot of momentum to really get it right,” says Rowen Price, senior policy advisor for nuclear energy at the nonprofit Third Way, which supports nuclear energy.

“Just a few years ago, the idea of Kentucky leading the next wave of nuclear energy development may have seemed ambitious,” Sen.

Or seismic activity sensors built for construction that go on to detect submarines underwater. These ideas represent the promise of dual-use technologies that serve both civilian and military purposes. For the first time, the European Commission is explicitly proposing to fund them through programmes such as Horizon Europe. But as we race to embrace dual-use technologies, we face a pivotal choice: continue the old model where military applications drive innovation that civilians later adopt, or turn this paradigm on its head?

Technological innovation has long followed a well-trodden path: the military drives development, with civilian applications emerging as an afterthought. Consider GPS, arguably one of the most successful dual-use technologies in history. Originally developed by the US Department of Defence in the 1970s, it was designed for military positioning and navigation. Civilian access was restricted by “Selective Availability” — a feature that intentionally degraded accuracy to preserve the military’s advantage.

The full potential of GPS remained unrealised for decades until the deactivation of Selective Availability in 2000, instantly making it 10 times more accurate for civilian users. It quickly became a technology that most of us rely on every day, sparking innovations that transformed industries from agriculture to transportation. A 2019 study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) estimated that GPS had generated $1.4 trillion in economic benefits.

This military-first approach, as we’ve seen with GPS, has dominated innovation funding for decades. Yet there’s compelling evidence that civilian-first approaches to dual-use technologies both better serve society’s immediate needs and ultimately produce more robust solutions for all applications — including military ones.

The traditional model overlooks a critical reality: civilian markets provide both scale and diversity of applications that drive innovation in ways the more specialised military sector cannot match. This pattern repeats across technological domains. Internet protocols developed for military communications found their greatest evolution in civilian applications, before returning to enhance military systems. The commercial drone industry has accelerated aerial innovation far beyond what military procurement alone could achieve.

By focusing on civilian-first use cases, innovation can leverage larger markets, more diverse applications, and faster development cycles. When technologies are developed with broad civilian applications in mind, they benefit from economies of scale that military-only development cannot achieve.

This is in part because civilian innovation faces fewer bureaucratic constraints. Military procurement cycles can span years or even decades, while civilian markets reward agility and rapid iteration. Developing for civilian use first allows technologies to evolve and mature faster than would be possible under traditional defence procurement timelines.

The most promising dual-use breakthroughs come from tackling fundamental technical challenges rather than specific operational functions. When innovators focus narrowly on military operations, they often miss the broader potential of their technologies. Scientific potential isn’t abstract; it only becomes real through implementation.

The challenge of developing robust navigation systems that work without GPS is a perfect example. A solution that enables delivery drones to navigate urban environments reliably could revolutionise logistics while simultaneously providing capabilities critical for defence operations. By emphasising civilian applications while acknowledging potential military uses, we create space for innovations that might otherwise never emerge.

Research from the European Commission on introducing a military tech aspect to the successor to Horizon Europe found that academic and research institutions would prefer to stick to the status quo, and keep Europe’s R&D funding solely for civilian technologies. By providing funding pathways that respect these preferences, we expand the talent pool, addressing critical technological challenges. Given the financial strains and political pressures in US higher education, Europe could attract top innovators from across the Atlantic by creating an environment aligned with their core values.

As Europe intensifies its focus on strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty, dual-use technologies will play an increasingly important role. The EU’s recent moves to allow dual-use funding through programs such as Horizon Europe represent an important shift in how we approach innovation. But as these initiatives take shape, they must avoid simply replicating the traditional military-first model.

By prioritising civilian use cases while acknowledging military applications, we can leverage market forces, attract diverse talent, and produce more robust technologies for all applications.

Yet for dual-use development to be truly durable, civilian and military technologies must no longer be siloed – we have to bridge the gap between civilian first R&D and military use cases. Given the chasm that exists between the way these two sectors operate, this will need to be an active process. Initiating more open knowledge exchange would better apply insights and learnings from both worlds back and forth. For bodies that focus on military technology, it is time to incubate a civilian equivalent. Conversely, organisations like mine — SPRIND, the German federal agency for disruptive innovation — focused on civilian technology, should also explore military applications.

The challenges we face — from climate change and energy security to supply chain resilience — require technological solutions that serve multiple purposes. The old dichotomy between civilian and military innovation is increasingly outdated in a world where the most powerful technologies inevitably serve both domains. The transformative dual-use technologies of tomorrow are closer than we think — if we focus on civilian use cases today.",,"Jano Costard, Story By","technology, drive, better, gps, technological, europe, civilian, technologies, civilianfirst, military, dualuse, applications, innovation",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:22.382299+00:00,76f7689545687b2aa309ac4046e811334ada9e3b0a8a07244cac7e2cdbd380f5

But he’s begun to wonder if candidates’ answers are genuine, even on video calls. “I can see their eyes shifting across the screen,” he says. “Then they come back with the perfect answer to a question.” The trust gap between employer and jobseeker is widening, and it’s fast becoming one of the trickiest knots in modern hiring.



From ChatGPT-polished CVs to full-blown applications submitted by bots, GenAI has hit the job market hard and gone fully mainstream. For a sizable generation of jobseekers — 68% of European tech workers were actively looking for a new role at the end of 2024 — it’s commonplace to use AI to tweak a CV or even complete an entire application.



Tools like Sonara, LazyApply, and JobCopilot have made it easy to shoot off dozens of applications in a day. In June, data from TestGorilla found that just over a third (37%) of UK jobseekers are using AI to complete applications. Among early-career candidates, it jumps to 60%, up from 38% the year before, according to Bright Network, which connects graduates and young professionals with recruiters.

Startups are at the forefront of this AI arms race. With smaller teams, shorter runways, and a culture of speed, they’re particularly exposed to this strange new world of suspiciously shiny applicants and AI-assisted code challenges. Most aren’t fighting it: 85% of employers now actively accept AI-assisted applications. But their acceptance doesn’t equal apathy. Amid a deluge of blatant AI use, how are Europe’s most agile companies working out who’s being real — and if they’re worth bringing onboard?

A new normal

Using AI to troubleshoot and tailor a CV has become par for the course. For most jobseekers, GenAI acts like a digital sidekick — smoothing grammar, sharpening phrasing, and cranking out tailored applications faster than ever. According to Canva’s January survey of 5,000 employees across countries including the UK, France, Spain, and Germany, 45% had used GenAI to build or improve a resume — and have yielded positive results. But hiring managers aren’t entirely sold. In the UK, 63% believe candidates should disclose if AI played a role in their application materials, signifying that trust is on shaky ground.

Other research suggests that attitudes depend on the context. A global survey by Experis (part of workforce giant ManpowerGroup) found that 28% of tech leaders are fine with AI if used to personalise a resume or cover letter, 26% with help on problem-solving tests, and 24% even with answering interview questions. Just 15% said AI use is unacceptable across the entire job application process.

For Duco van Lanschot, co-founder of fintech startup Duna, it’s all about the role. “If an engineer used ChatGPT to polish a written application, fine. That’s not the job. But for a growth or sales hire to use it very obviously is a big red flag,” he says. “The job itself involves public-facing comms and emailing stakeholders — and in a sea of generic, AI-generated copy, I want us to be as human as possible.”

Tech employers and startups are adapting — albeit in different ways and at different speeds. Some are setting ground rules for usage, some are bulking out human-only processes, and some are cutting away entire parts of the “traditional” hiring approach. “AI hasn’t broken hiring,” says Marija Marcenko, Head of Global Talent Acquisition at SaaS platform Semrush. “But it’s changed how we engage with candidates.”

Goodbye to CVs

In the words of Khyati Sundaram, ethical AI hiring expert and CEO of Applied, we’re in the middle of “an AI-on-AI war.” And in the fallout, traditional application materials are losing their sway. In the tech sector, cover letters fell into obsolescence long ago, and CVs are next on the chopping block. “A huge upside is that it’s exposing résumés for what they are — a broken artefact,” says Sundaram, whose team works with the likes of Unicef UK, BLab, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. “Putting résumés into keyword scanners or GenAI tools isn’t solving the problem for those hiring, because when it comes to the interview, the candidate falls apart,” she explains.

Instead of cover letters and cut-and-paste CVs, employers are turning to structured questionnaires and skill-based tasks — tools that measure how someone thinks, not just how well they can write a prompt. “Skill-based hiring is no longer just a tech hiring thing,” Sundaram adds. “We’re seeing that crop up in more white-collar roles across the board.” According to TestGorilla, 77% of UK employers now use skills tests to evaluate candidates, with the same proportion saying these tests outperform CVs in predicting job success. This should have a positive effect in the long term: LinkedIn’s Economic Graph Institute found that a skills-based approach globally could expand talent pools by 6.1x, and help broaden gender and minority representation.

At Semrush, the shakeup is already in full swing. Hiring managers are trained to sniff out fluency without depth, spotting signs of AI in real-time coding challenges or task-based interviews. “We’ve replaced the usual ‘Tell me about yourself’ prompts with in-depth interviews that explore experience, soft skills, and thinking patterns,” says Marcenko. “It’s hard to fake those, with or without AI.”



Applied’s own system uses a mix of automation and human insight. “We don’t believe in AI detectors — they’re rarely accurate, so we train reviewers to pattern match like an AI, comparing submissions to known GPT outputs,” explains Sundaram. “If five responses sound suspiciously identical, humans can flag them.”

Elsewhere, startups are getting more creative and more human. Alessandro Bonati, Chief People Officer at travel scaleup WeRoad, has ditched cover letters in favour of more creative, human-centric formats like curated portfolios or briefs of the “show, don’t tell” type. The company, which has over 210 staff in offices across Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, actively encourages candidates to use AI. “But that’s also accompanied by traditional in-person interviews to assess candidates’ thinking, communication, and cultural fit in real time,” says Bonati. His team also leans on real-time scenario-based exercises that reflect how candidates would collaborate, not just how well they can prepare.

The return of the reference and in-person interviews

Another ripple effect: references are back on the menu. Santiago Nestares, co-founder of the accounting startup DualEntry, is spending more time face-to-face on Zoom with candidates. “Experience is hard to fake,” says Nestares. “You can usually tell when someone’s just read about something versus having lived it.” He’s also going deeper on references; not just the usual ones, as those are always glowing, but backchannel conversations with people who’ve worked with them directly. “It’s so we can find out how someone handles pressure, works with a team, and shows up day to day,” says Nestares.

Through building the team for Connectd, a platform which enables angel investors and founders to effectively manage their startups, Samuel has noticed that candidates are cutting through the lack of trust by building more social proof around themselves. “For hiring managers, instead of taking a candidate’s word for it, we’re diving into references more than ever,” he says.

The dreaded take-home task is on the way out now too. Unpaid and time-consuming, candidates have long despised them, and now that there’s the option of using GenAI to fake it (until they make it), employers are souring on them too. Live interviews, technical walk-throughs, scenario-based challenges, and even roleplay simulations are becoming the new standard, particularly in product, design, and marketing roles. “AI detectors are being used,” says Andreas Bundi, founder of Berlin-based HR consultancy Bundls. “But most companies are asking — why bother with take-homes when you can just do a live assessment?”



Bundi, who works with clients like Pitch, Cradle and Telli, says hybrid companies with mandatory office days are ditching take-homes to keep the interview process aligned with on-site work. With more candidates on the market, jobseekers are going further — relocating, or even flying in for interviews.



In the same vein, well-funded companies are increasingly comfortable bringing people on-site for tasks. “When travel isn’t possible, I’ve arranged in-person meetings with interviewers who happen to be nearby,” says Bundi. “I recently scheduled interviews around a conference both the candidate and interviewer were attending.” This “networking meets hiring approach” works surprisingly well.

Bundi says he sees that it’s the AI-first companies that are more relaxed about candidates using tools like ChatGPT — but it’s rarely made explicit. Recently, one of his Lead Data Scientists blew an interview by manually wrangling messy data instead of automating it. “They thought they needed to demonstrate their raw coding skills,” says Bundi. “But the company wanted strategy, not a human data janitor. That’s what ChatGPT is for.” As AI becomes standard, candidates and companies will need to get clearer on where it fits in the process. Until then, these frictions will continue.

Hire for skills and values, not a job description

Despite the ubiquity of AI-powered applications, most companies still haven’t formalised their approach. “It’s confusing for candidates, as some companies don’t want AI used in applications, even though those same roles involve AI tools every day,” says Sundaram. Indeed, 40% of employers using BrightNetwork services said they still haven’t set guidelines for AI usage in their processes, although 28% plan to for the next recruitment season. Of those who have set guidelines, 44% don’t allow candidates to use AI.



“The vanguard employers want everyone to use it and demonstrate their AI literacy,” says Sundaram. Some of Applied’s clients have even added the question: ‘How will you use AI in this job?’ She warns, however, that many of the quick fixes employers reach for — AI detectors, video screening with facial tracking, voice sentiment tools — raise huge ethical concerns. “If companies are tracking facial expressions for emotional nuance, it gets creepy,” she says. “Where do we draw the line?”



Instead, she argues, the fix will lie in redefining what candidates are being tested for. Applied has shifted from traditional job architecture to task architecture, evaluating not just skills, but values like resilience, adaptability, and mission alignment. “These are the human traits that will matter even more as jobs evolve,” she says. “Especially in startups, where everyone’s a generalist.”

Without doubt, generative AI is fundamentally reshaping the hiring process. The most forward-looking startups aren’t resisting the change — they’re building better processes around it. CVs may be broken, cover letters outdated, and applications increasingly synthetic — but the real differentiator is still very human. “We need people who can adapt, not just apply,” says Sundaram. “Because the job they’re hired for today may not exist in six months.” Startups that understand this and structure their hiring accordingly aren’t just future-proofing their teams, they’re rewriting the rules of work for the AI era.",,"Megan Carnegie, Story By","playbook, rewriting, ai, job, aionai, candidates, sundaram, war, companies, theyre, recruitment, applications, employers, human, hiring",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:23.003024+00:00,a4f6b086bdd4bcd929bb2ca4696119aa3ef3cfbb6a6037db5f55c2e5b18487ea

On Tuesday, a Change.org petition rapidly neared its 50,000-signature goal, with tens of thousands hoping that with enough users protesting, the wide rollout of the AI age checks might be stopped. They fear the age checks will make it harder to access content they love while staying anonymous on the platform

YouTube's age verification system estimates user ages by interpreting a ""variety of signals,"" YouTube's announcement said, including ""the types of videos a user is searching for, the categories of videos they have watched, or the longevity of the account.""

If a user is estimated to be under 18, YouTube restricts the account by disabling personalized ads, turning on digital wellbeing tools to prevent young users from being bombarded with harmful content, and adding other safeguards, like limiting repetitive views of certain types of content. To lift these restrictions, YouTube requires users to share either a government ID, a credit card, or a selfie to authenticate their actual ages.

Privacy experts previously told Ars that YouTube's AI age checks are concerning. YouTube does not specify how any of the data received from users incorrectly labeled as teens will be used or how long it will be stored. A YouTube spokesperson only told Ars that the company ""does not retain data from"" a user's ""ID or Payment Card for the purposes of advertising.""

Users signing the Change.org petition shared privacy experts' concerns. They’re concerned that an invasive system of perhaps questionable quality will deem their viewing habits immature, requiring them to hand over data that could be leaked or breached.

These days, it feels like facts are getting harder to come by. Curiosity Stream's focus on science, history, research, and learning is the perfect antidote to this problem. The streaming service offers documentaries to people who love learning and are looking for a reliable source of educational media with no sensationalism or political agendas.

Curiosity Stream is $5 per month or $40 per year for an ad-free, curated approach to documentary content. Launched in 2015 by Discovery Channel founder John Hendricks, the service offers “more new films and shows every week” and has pledged to produce even more original content.

It has been a while since cable channels like Discovery or The History Channel have been regarded as reputable documentary distributors. You can find swaths of so-called documentaries on other streaming services, especially Amazon Prime Video, but finding a quality documentary on mainstream streaming services often requires sifting through conspiracy theories, myths, and dubious arguments.

Curiosity Stream boasts content from respected names like James Burke, Brian Greene, and Neil deGrasse Tyson. Among Curiosity Stream's most well-known programs are Stephen Hawking's Favorite Places, a News and Documentary Emmy Award winner; David Attenborough's Light on Earth, a Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival award winner; Secrets of the Solar System, a News & Documentary Emmy Award nominee; and the currently trending Ancient Engineering: Middle East.",,,"documentary, arent, streams, services, curiosity, watching, content, stream, best, burke, streaming, award, james",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:33.278683+00:00,b420ad050c5f71c3bc438a488a5ddd4c6bc630a56859fff3b822f2e89f56bc43
51,thenextweb.com,https://thenextweb.com/news/europe-humanoid-robotics-strategy,Why Europe could quietly win the humanoid race,2025-08-04T07:39:30+00:00,"Elon Musk’s Optimus demo at Tesla’s We Robot event made one thing clear: when it comes to humanoids, the spotlight still belongs to the United States. Then there is Asia — with China’s rapid developments and Japan and South Korea’s deep legacy in robotics. Headlines still gravitate toward billion-dollar budgets, rapid hardware iterations, and slick simulation reels.

Behind the noise, though, another development is unfolding in Europe — quieter, but potentially far more consequential. The next chapter of humanoid robotics may be defined not by who moves first or builds the flashiest prototypes, but by who moves with the discipline and consistency required. And Europe has the potential to lead this new era.

Regulation as strategy

In most conversations about innovation, regulation is framed as a brake. In Silicon Valley, it’s often seen as a hurdle to scale or a signal of bureaucratic overreach. But Europe — particularly in AI and robotics — is rewriting that narrative. With the AI Act now adopted, the EU is the first region to offer comprehensive legal clarity around the deployment of high-risk AI systems, including humanoid robots.

We must also consider that, eventually, other countries will likely adopt regulatory frameworks that align broadly with the EU’s, even if they’re less stringent. By designing with European standards from the outset, we’ll be well-positioned to adapt quickly as new regulations emerge elsewhere.

This clarity matters. When investors and industrial partners can reliably assess compliance risks, they’re most likely to commit resources. In a field as complex and potentially disruptive as robotics, clear rules don’t slow down progress — they de-risk it.

Europe has also introduced or updated several other regulations that directly impact robotics:

The Product Liability Directive now includes software and AI, reducing ambiguity and incentivising safer design practices.

The General Product Safety Regulation streamlines cross-border market entry with harmonised safety standards.

The Machinery Regulation defines clearer certification routes for robotic systems.

Together, these frameworks give the EU a coherent and predictable regulatory environment. Yes, it’s tough, but given the implications, this provides exactly what the humanoid sector needs: clarity.

Deployment, not demos

While the US often relies on innovation funded by Big Tech monopolies and China leans on state-driven manufacturing strategies, Europe’s robotics sector is built on modular collaboration. Startups and research labs spin out into well-funded clusters, often supported by EU-backed initiatives like RI4EU and EIC Accelerator. These programs offer access to testbeds, pilot funding, and collaborative R&D networks.

Furthermore, Europe’s geographic and industrial structure gives it a special advantage: close proximity to real-world use cases. Having neighbouring logistics hubs, manufacturing zones, and retail chains in contiguity helps speed iteration and aligns development with the continent’s actual operational pain points. McKinsey estimates that in some of Europe’s critical sectors — including retail and logistics — payroll alone amounts to $1.7 trillion (€1.55 trillion). This makes automation highly profitable and ripe for disruption.

These factors have played a key role in the strategy of Humanoid, the robotics company I founded in the UK last year. Our goal isn’t just to impress on stage; it’s far more important that we seamlessly integrate innovations into real workflows. For this, we’ve adopted a simple, modular design philosophy: a wheeled base that suits logistics environments, accelerated by simulation plus feedback from real industry trials. We believe that hype must be based on reality — a mindset that’s drawing US investors to European robotics.

This shift is already reflected in funding dynamics. Neura Robotics’ €120mn funding round in January 2025 was one of the largest in European robotics to date. And investors are now betting on full-stack teams with credible deployment strategies — instead of merely speculative tech.

A better fit for the future of work

Beyond reducing uncertainty, European regulation also helps encode values that shape how humanoid robots are developed and deployed. The AI Act requires high-risk systems — including those used in workplaces, public spaces, and healthcare settings — to meet strict safety, transparency, and human oversight standards.

Such a framework fosters trust, which is essential for robots operating in sensitive environments like factories, hospitals, or elderly care facilities. Europe’s emphasis on traceability and ethical co-development goes beyond mitigating risk — it creates the conditions for adoption at scale, where safety and dignity are non-negotiable.

Additionally, this approach helps position robots as partners. By designing for augmentation rather than displacement — as often seen in the US — European startups are modelling a more human-centred approach to automation. They’re also offering an alternative to the dominant narrative that robots will replace humans in critical roles.

It’s also worth noting that some jobs aren’t meant for people, as they hinder individuals from reaching their full potential. For instance, a humanoid could take over the task of moving boxes around a warehouse all day. This is not simply a replacement; it is an augmentation of existing automation capabilities, which empowers people to find more purpose-driven work.

That distinction comes into sharper focus when we look at the places where humanoids are most needed, such as logistics hubs, clinics, and care homes. These environments have real spatial and regulatory constraints and little room for error. The tasks there are repetitive but require precision, and people are extremely busy. In these settings, robots need to quietly support the flow of work, not interrupt it. That requires thoughtful integration, which means responding at the right pace, handling objects predictably, and, yes, staying out of the way when needed.

These are practical challenges shaped by day-to-day routines, not only engineering feats. And, from our vantage point, Europe’s cautious, user-informed development model is well-suited to meet them.

Supply chains and strategic independence

There are still concerns in European robotics that need to be addressed. As of 2025, China controls 63% of the humanoid hardware supply chain, from rare-earth magnets to key actuators. However, we’re now seeing global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) based in Europe partnering with humanoid creators early on to co-develop hardware components together. This strategy can mitigate the risk of over-dependence.

On the other hand, while the US dominates in AI software, few actors globally offer fully-integrated stacks. We see some moves in that direction in the US and China, and Europe — which is still dependent on imports — must learn to navigate this space assertively.

Calls for supply diversification are growing. In June 2025, Benjamin Krieger, from the European Association of Automotive Suppliers (CLEPA), emphasised the need for stronger EU supply chain routes due to China’s export controls on rare-earth elements. In the US, analysts are sounding similar alarms.

To reduce dependency, Europe will need to support local manufacturing of key components, incentivise alternative sourcing, and form trade alliances outside Beijing’s orbit.

What’s next?

The next phase of humanoid robotics will not be won by whoever moves fastest. It will be won by whoever builds best.

What will this require? To start, bolstering funding and support mechanisms that help innovations advance through the later stages of the Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) scale — and move from pilots to industrial-grade rollouts. Second, forging industrial partnerships that begin during prototyping, not after. Third, policy agility to fast-track certification while maintaining the highest safety standards.

What’s at stake isn’t just who secures the most patents — we’ve already seen that happen without meaningful real-world deployment. The true challenge is whether we can build systems that integrate safely into human environments, uphold public trust, and address the real concerns people have — from privacy and transparency to everyday safety and interaction.

Europe doesn’t need to mimic Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Instead, it needs to double down on what it already does well: interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical tech design, and industrial pragmatism.

This is an evacuation, no? I find this sad in a lot of ways just because I remember when Tuvalu was kind of the poster child for climate change, and it was like, we have to save places like this island nation, and it just sort of feels like, I think practical and understandable and humane, but also, I don't know, an indication that we're giving up and that there's sort of defeat of we're actually just going to move people. I don't know. What do you think?

Zoë Schiffer: No, I mean, I completely agree. I also remember this story evolving over time, and it feels like with so many things with climate change will have the big headline, ""We have to do X by this year or this other thing will happen."" And we've just again and again and again been like, “OK, that didn't happen."" And so we're accepting that floods are going to happen, or rising sea levels are going to damage this area or whatever and now we're on to dealing with the fallout from that.

Louise Matsakis: Yeah, and even in this case, I think the agreement that Tuvalu has with Australia is less than 300 people can move a year and be evacuated as I'm going to keep using that word. And that's still not that many. There's still going to be people on this island as the seas rise.

Zoë Schiffer: I mean, yeah, it's not the only thing that Tuvalu has done since 2022. The country has been trying to undergo this ambitious strategy to become the world's quote, unquote, ""first digital nation"", which included 3D scanning of the islands to digitally recreate them and preserve parts of the culture and moving government functions to a virtual environment, which makes sense. But yeah, I mean, I think the reality is a lot is going to be lost in this process. And like you said, the number of people that they're able to move every year is less than 300, so it's going to be slow, and I think painful in some ways.

Louise Matsakis: Totally.

Zoë Schiffer: Coming up after the break, we dive into Louisa's story on how ChatGPT's tendency to ignore the context of the information it absorbs is showing up in extremely weird ways. Stay with us. Welcome back to Uncanny Valley. I'm Zoë Schiffer. I'm joined today by WIRED's Louise Matsakis, who recently reported on how a lack of context is becoming an increasingly alarming problem for ChatGPT and other chatbots. Louisa's reporting explores why ChatGPT went into demon mode when it was speaking with Atlantic staffers recently. Last week, an editor at the Atlantic reported that ChatGPT started praising Satan and encouraging ceremonies that involved various forms of self-mutilation. So Louise, what the hell is going on?

Louise Matsakis: So the Atlantic reported this story that basically made the case that know ChatGPT has these safeguards against things like self-harm, but there's all these edge cases that suddenly send the chatbot into kind of a role-playing mode. And so they were like, ""Hey, can you make a ritual for Molech, which is this ancient God that shows up in the Bible that's associated with child sacrifice?"" And ChatGPT saw that word and immediately went into this role-playing game where it started talking about things like deep magic experience called the Gate of the Devourer. It asked the Atlantic journalists if they wanted something called a reverent bleeding scroll. And so all that sounds like really bizarre, and you might think like, oh, there's a lot of content on the internet about demonic rituals. Satanists are everywhere, especially online. That's probably what's going on here. But when I looked into it, all of this lore and jargon actually comes from a game called 40,000 Warhammer, which is this tabletop war playing game that you play with these little figurines, and it's been around since the 1980s. People who love this stuff love it. And they are online, the Reddits are popping off all days of the week. There's so many science fiction books, there's so many... I honestly struggle to think of deeper lores than this game. And as a result, ChatGPT ingested all that information. And when the Atlantic used the word Molech, which is a planet in the universe of this game, it immediately just sort of assumed that this was another Warhammer fan who wanted to go into role-playing or get into the fantasy world of this game.",,"Zoë Schiffer, Louise Matsakis, Michael Calore, Jake Lahut, Emily Mullin, Wired Staff, John Semley","atlantic, game, matsakis, chatgpt, going, schiffer, goes, demon, roundup, word, yeah, think, mode, wired, theres",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:44.621450+00:00,57d967e473bdcd7467e0fa5641dfcc6cea27c6eb4a2954e41451fcd39a470b36

Raj Agrawal, the former commander of the Space Force's Space Mission Delta 2.

If it seems like there's a satellite launch almost every day, the numbers will back you up.

The US Space Force's Mission Delta 2 is a unit that reports to Space Operations Command, with the job of sorting out the nearly 50,000 trackable objects humans have launched into orbit.

Dozens of satellites are being launched each week, primarily by SpaceX to continue deploying the Starlink broadband network. The US military has advance notice of these launches—most of them originate from Space Force property—and knows exactly where they're going and what they're doing.

That's usually not the case when China or Russia (and occasionally Iran or North Korea) launches something into orbit. With rare exceptions, like human spaceflight missions, Chinese and Russian officials don't publish any specifics about what their rockets are carrying or what altitude they're going to.

That creates a problem for military operators tasked with monitoring traffic in orbit and breeds anxiety among US forces responsible for making sure potential adversaries don't gain an edge in space. Will this launch deploy something that can destroy or disable a US satellite? Will this new satellite have a new capability to surveil allied forces on the ground or at sea?

Of course, this is precisely the point of keeping launch details under wraps. The US government doesn't publish orbital data on its most sensitive satellites, such as spy craft collecting intelligence on foreign governments.

But you can't hide in low-Earth orbit, a region extending hundreds of miles into space. Col. Raj Agrawal, who commanded Mission Delta 2 until earlier this month, knows this all too well. Agrawal handed over command to Col. Barry Croker as planned after a two-year tour of duty at Mission Delta 2.

The Data Protection Act, the GDPR, and the recent AI Act — aligned more closely with local workers’ laws and unions — have set the continent on a separate path.

A recent joint study from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and Poland’s National Research Institute (NASK) found that Europe — along with Asia — tops the list of most exposed regions to AI, far surpassing the Americas. With studies finding that one in four jobs are at risk of being transformed by AI globally, the impact in Europe — a region which faces a significant shortage of skilled workers — has become a pressing concern.

“In many ways, it’s too early to tell where the AI wave will take us — we’ve only seen a fraction of its capabilities so far, which is equal parts exciting and terrifying,” Adam Maurer, COO at Connecting Software, a tech company operating across Europe, told TNW.

In recent years, Big Tech companies have frequently carried out mass layoffs, driven both by revenue concerns and the belief that AI can take over many of the functions of employees from entry to mid-level, Maurer said.

Some of these AI-driven layoffs have effectively targeted low performers, but other initiatives have been problematic. At Klarna, for example, they had concerning impacts on the business.

Klarna, a Swedish fintech company that fired 700 workers and replaced them with AI, recently announced it will hire humans back again. The company’s CEO admitted to having made a “mistake” when replacing workers with AI.

“It’s very clear that AI will definitely replace some jobs,” Maurer said. “On the other side of the coin, I think it will make some other jobs far more valuable.”

In the EU, labour laws and regulations will shape the impact on jobs. Tech leaders believe they could lead to an AI future that benefits both workers and businesses.

The talk among executives

Maurer said there may be some expectation for the EU to step in and regulate job displacement. However, he argued that would stagnate growth and discourage startups from doing business in the union.

But not every business leader agrees. Displacement will happen, but not because of AI, said Volodymyr Kubytskyi, head of AI at MacPaw, a Ukrainian software company developing solutions for Apple devices.

“AI disrupts the traditional logic and processes of work,” Kubytskyi told TNW. “The real question is, ‘Can we redesign work processes before this outdated system collapses?’” To prevent the system from collapsing, leaders must stop thinking of AI as a quick-win or cost-saving tool, he said.

Kubytskyi argued that while the AI Act was necessary to set a baseline for the industry, it doesn’t account for potential job disruption, which is a gap in the regulatory landscape.

“To account for this, the AI Act should be updated, but it’s unlikely that this will happen soon,” he said.

Roman Eloshvili, founder of ComplyControl, a UK compliance company, told TNW that the AI Act targets safety, transparency, and ethics, but falls short on socio-economic impact, especially on jobs. “So, amendments are necessary,” he said.

“I expect that, over time, some of them, such as mandates for employer-led upskilling or protections for displaced workers, will appear to address workforce implications more effectively.”

Will the AI Act become outdated or even counterproductive, especially if its stringent compliance mechanisms amplify inequalities in access to AI benefits? Or is it too early in the game to amend the law?

Kris Jones, who leads the engineering team in Belfast for iVerify, believes it’s too soon to make changes. He said the AI Act’s risk-based framework already strikes a delicate balance between protecting fundamental rights and giving innovators room to breathe.

Amending the regulation is not the only policy idea discussed among executives. Jones told TNW that member states have other levers to pull. “One idea floating around is an ‘AI token’ tax,” he said.

A token tax would enable governments to generate revenue from AI usage that is producing income. These funds would then be redistributed through measures such as reskilling programs or support for affected industries.

Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, recently told Axios that the concept could offset the inevitable wipeout of millions of entry-level white-collar jobs lost to AI.

“Measures like that can cushion any job shocks without putting a blanket lid on innovation,” Amodei said.

Are clashes with European labour and trade unions inevitable?

European labour and trade union bodies have often been ignored in the debate over AI job displacement. But many of them have already made official statements expressing concerns over AI.

Ahead of the Paris AI Summit in February 2025, the ETUC, representing over 45 million European workers, issued an open letter about AI’s dangers. It warned that any efforts to ensure AI has “a positive impact on workers in the labour markets, quality jobs, and society will be annulled if AI is monopolised by a handful of tech companies”.

The previous August, UK unions, including Accord and Unite, had called for regulations to protect workers from AI. They also proposed reskilling programs for workers, reminded companies of their transparency obligations, and emphasised the need for union consultations. They said that they intended to protect workers’ rights against AI‑driven hiring and firing, as well as defend IP rights for creative professionals.

We asked tech firms whether they expect companies to face challenges with labour laws and unions in Europe.

“Undoubtedly,” Eloshvili from ComplyControl said. “European robust worker protections and active unions present both a safeguard and challenges for AI integration.”

Unions will demand transparency and worker involvement in AI deployment as automation threatens certain jobs, he said. “Firms that try to impose AI solutions without dialogue definitely risk conflict and backlash.”

Despite the challenges, Eloshvili said it isn’t a zero-sum game. “When businesses and unions work together — for example, under joint upskilling initiatives — AI can become an effective tool for improving working conditions,” he said.

Kubytskyi from MacPaw agreed that challenges will arise on this front and described the pushback from unions and workers’ organisations as “understandable”.

“Clarity, structure, and communication are vital,” he said. “If you integrate new [AI] agents into existing workflows without involving people, you’ll get pushback, and for a good reason.”

Kubytskyi also believes that conflict can be avoided. “To prevent this, we need to show people what AI does, what guardrails are in place, and why it will benefit the team.”

Jorge Riera, the CEO of big data and AI consultancy Dataco, agrees. “The most effective AI deployments are strategic,” he said, adding that careful analysis is needed to decipher which work tasks should be offloaded to AI.

Flipping the script to develop AI the ‘European way’

Jones from iVerify explained that regulations, trade unions, and workers’ rights in Europe are not necessarily an obstacle and could, in fact, be beneficial.

He believes companies should embed responsible AI, bias checks, explainability, and human oversight loops into each product cycle. That way, they can transform the AI Act from a compliance hurdle into a market differentiator, Jones explained.

“Europe can’t sit out the AI wave; the Bay Area now fields roughly half of the world’s unicorns and hoovers up 80% of GenAI funding, while much of the European workforce is ageing and a quarter of young Europeans can’t find work,” Jones said.

Europe is not only facing competition from the usual suspects — Asia and the US — but also from Latin America, where heavy investment in technology is underway.

Mahesh Raja, chief growth officer of Ness Digital Engineering, which operates innovation centres in the UK and Czechia, highlighted how this lack of similar investment is hurting business. “Fifty-three percent of small- and medium-size businesses found the initial cost of AI implementation to be much higher than anticipated. We need to address the adoption challenges that stem from legacy IT infrastructures and improve the collective time-to-value for this emerging technology,” he said.

However, Europe’s stringent regulations can become a premium brand for banks, healthtechs, and any sector that values trust and data privacy.

”Europe shouldn’t just photocopy Silicon Valley,” Jones said. He believes the continent’s strengths lie in a combination of factors, including upskilling and STEM PhD graduates per capita. The privacy-first and safe AI leadership — solidified in regulation — can bolster the package.

“Overall, Europe should push hard on AI augmentation and skill-building, or we’ll fall further behind,” Jones said. “But do it Europe’s way, leveraging our ethical governance, deep industrial know-how, and cross-border talent pipelines instead of importing the Valley’s blitz-and-break culture wholesale.”",,"Ray Fernandez, Story By","work, act, ai, workers, europe, stifling, unions, jobs, told, protect, eus, labour, jones, innovation",pending,2025-08-13T07:36:24.219917+00:00,d5d63c25b67f85daae93803735f2880db3af5f7910d11a2d0bcb679009816f51

Epic has won again. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will not overturn the unanimous jury verdict from 2023 that Google’s app store and payments system have become illegal monopolies — and it’s pressing play on a previously paused permanent injunction that would crack open Android to undo those monopolies. “Total victory in the Epic v Google appeal!” tweeted Epic CEO Tim Sweeney.

On Thursday, a three-judge panel affirmed the lower court’s decision in Epic v. Google, according to a full opinion you can read below — and Google will now appeal again, the company confirms to The Verge.

On Friday morning, Google revealed that because of the Ninth Circuit decision, it only has 14 days to begin changing how its Android app store and business practices work. But on Friday afternoon, the Ninth Circuit granted at least one extra week in an emergency stay, while Google works on its appeal.

Judge M. Margaret McKeown begins her opinion for the Ninth Circuit panel:

In the world of adrenaline-fueled survival that epitomizes the video game Fortnite, winners are decided in blazes of destruction and glory. By contrast, the outcome of this case—centered on Fortnite’s developer, Epic Games, and the Google Android platform—turns on longstanding principles of trial procedure, antitrust, and injunctive remedies.

Google will appeal. But the Google Play Store is not necessarily protected from the consequences of its monopoly while Google tries to do so — unless it keeps getting the courts to press pause, Google must start cracking open Android for third-party stores the way Judge James Donato ruled in his permanent injunction from 2024.

Last October, Donato pressed pause on all but one specific piece of his ruling while Google appealed, but Judge McKeown writes “The stay motion on appeal is denied as moot in light of our decision” — and Epic has already announced it will put its own app store within Google’s app store.

“Thanks to the verdict, the Epic Games Store for Android will be coming to the Google Play Store!” Sweeney tweeted. “The stay is lifted,” Epic spokesperson Cat McCormack confirms to The Verge.

The consequences of the full permanent injunction stretch far beyond Epic’s own store and its game Fortnite. They would force Google to effectively open up its app store to competition for three whole years. Google would have to distribute other rival app stores within the Google Play store, too, give rivals access to the full catalog of Google Play apps, and it would be banned from a variety of anticompetitive practices including a requirement that apps use Google Play Billing. You can read a summary of the details here.

“This decision will significantly harm user safety, limit choice, and undermine the innovation that has always been central to the Android ecosystem. Our top priority remains protecting our users, developers and partners, and maintaining a secure platform as we continue our appeal,” writes Google global head of regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland in a statement shared with The Verge.

It’s worth noting that Google won’t immediately have to put rival app stores within its own Google Play Store; Judge Donato originally gave Google eight months to come up with a “narrowly tailored” system to ensure Android safety and security. Once the stays end, Google will still have over seven months left, so don’t expect a store-within-store situation before 2026 at the earliest.

But unless Google keeps winning stays, other parts of the permanent injunction — like a ban on forcing app developers to use Google Play Billing — will take effect in mere weeks.

Epic originally sued both Google and Apple in 2020 over the removal of its hit game Fortnite from both stores, though the case was more complicated than that. Epic intentionally used Fortnite as a wedge to challenge the app store monopolies, and in the case of Apple, it mostly lost.

The appeals court did recognize Epic’s gambit on Thursday, writing that “Google removed Fortnite from the Play Store after Epic embedded secret code into the app’s software” that bypassed Google’s payment systems. (Epic has never denied it.)

But Epic v. Google turned out to be a very different case, we saw when attending the trial in person and reading all the receipts. A jury saw secret revenue sharing deals between Google, smartphone makers, and game developers. The jury saw internal emails between Google execs that suggested Google was scared of how Epic might convince its fellow game developers to join or create rival app stores, creating unwanted competition for Google. Here are a few thoughts about why Epic won against Google, but not Apple.

On Thursday, the Ninth Circuit rejected the idea that the decision in the Apple case should impact the Google case, at least in terms of the all-important question of market definition, aka “can Google really have a monopoly on Android apps if it’s competing against Apple?”

“The market definition question was neither identical to the issue in this case nor litigated and decided in Apple,” McKeown writes, adding that the “commercial realities are different”:

Apple’s “walled garden” is, as the district court in Apple noted, markedly different from Google’s “open distribution” approach […] Google admits as much, noting that “Android’s open philosophy offers users and developers wider choices” than iOS does, even as that openness “limit[s] Google’s ability to directly protect users from encountering malware and security threats when they download apps.” As a consequence of its business model, Apple does not license iOS to other OEMs in the way that Google licenses Android to Samsung, Motorola, and other smartphone manufacturers.

She also uses McDonalds and Chick-fil-A to make a point that markets can overlap:

McDonald’s might compete against Chick-fil-A in the fast- food market yet not compete against Chick-fil-A in the hamburger fast-food market (and instead compete with Wendy’s, Burger King, Sonic, and In-N-Out Burger. Although Google and Apple compete for mobile-gaming downloads and mobile-gaming in-app transactions, they do not compete in the Android-only app distribution and in-app billing markets.

Those two markets, Android app distribution and in-app billing, are where a jury unanimously decided that Google has illegal monopolies.

Many of those problems have persisted, but little by little, foldables have gotten better. With the release of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has made the biggest leap yet. This device solves some of the most glaring problems with Samsung's foldables, featuring a new, slimmer design and a big camera upgrade.

Samsung's seventh-generation foldable has finally crossed that hazy boundary between novelty and practicality, putting a tablet-sized screen in your pocket without as many compromises. There are still some drawbacks, of course, but for the first time, this feels like a foldable phone you'd want to carry around.

Whether or not you can justify the $1,999 price tag is another matter entirely.

Most improved foldable

Earlier foldable phones were pocket-busting bricks, but companies like Google, Huawei, and OnePlus have made headway streamlining the form factor—the Pixel 9 Pro Fold briefly held the title of thinnest foldable when it launched last year. Samsung, however, stuck with the same basic silhouette for versions one through six, shaving off a millimeter here and there with each new generation. Now, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has successfully leapfrogged the competition with an almost unbelievably thin profile.

Specs at a glance: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 - $1,999 SoC Snapdragon 8 Elite Memory 12GB, 16GB Storage 256GB, 512GB, 1TB Display Cover: 6.5-inch 1080×2520 120 Hz OLED

Unfolded: 158.4×143.2×4.2 mm

215 g

Clocking in at just 215 g and 8.9 mm thick when folded, the Z Fold 7 looks and feels like a regular smartphone when closed. It's lighter than Samsung's flagship flat phone, the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and is only a fraction of a millimeter thicker. The profile is now limited by the height of the standard USB-C port. You can use the Z Fold 7 in its closed state without feeling hindered by an overly narrow display or hand-stretching thickness.

326,thenextweb.com,https://thenextweb.com/news/vc-funding-european-deep-tech-challenges-and-solutions,Why traditional VC is failing deep tech — and what can fix it,2025-07-31T06:00:20+00:00,"Europe’s deep tech future hinges on evolving investment strategies. The reason for this is that traditional funding models cannot support the long-term financial commitments that innovation demands. There is a European paradox where, despite substantial scientific research, early commercialisation and a focus on shorter-term goals prevent the region from realising the full potential of deep tech. Although startups provide strong support, the sector still lags behind the US and Asia in bringing breakthroughs from the lab to market.

To maintain a competitive industry, Europe needs to advance technologies like AI, robotics, synthetic biology, and quantum computing, which are at the heart of the deep tech sector. These technologies aren’t just profitable. They can transform the world, from cochlear implants restoring hearing to aerospace engineering enabling missions to Mars. But none of these advances happen without patient, long-term investment in science, engineering, and design.

Startups focused on rapid-deployment SaaS or consumer apps can commercialise quickly and attract early investment. Deep tech is different: there’s a “valley of death” driven by long R&D cycles, high upfront costs, and greater risk tolerance than in traditional software ventures.

It’s worth examining which new funding models are working — and how they are starting to take hold in Europe. Drawing on insights from my investment practice — Zubr Capital — this analysis explores the real opportunity for Europe to leverage deep tech and reclaim lost market share, rather than see its startups move to mature financial ecosystems like the US, Asia, or Israel.

Why classic VC struggles with deep tech

Traditional software startups typically follow a familiar funding cycle blueprint. It raises a 10-year fund, deploys gained capital over three to five years, and aims for lucrative investment exits within five to seven years. The startup defines a successful funding cycle based on rapid growth, scalability, and relatively low capital requirements.

Deep tech cannot operate within this traditional financial mould. Startups operating in this category need development cycles that often exceed a decade. Regulations from subcategories like healthcare, energy, and aerospace require numerous certifications and tests to verify advanced capabilities. That is an area where generalist VCs rarely tread due to a need for patient capital.

Most deep tech companies have to overcome specific industrial and geographical thresholds. A French aerospace firm, for instance, may not have the infrastructure to take advantage of traditional funding the way a US giant like Delta can.

Established investment models present several obstacles to deep tech companies. For example:

Pressure for visible traction pushes startups to pivot from deep tech to commercial projects.

Traditional VCs often lack the expertise to evaluate complex projects properly.

Europe has smaller funds for upfront and long-term costs.

There is a “valley of death” for deep tech to cover R&D from public funds.

EU investors tend to be risk-averse due to the stigma of failure.

Fragmentation within the industry, with multiple markets, regulations, and heavy bureaucracy, slows funding.

Foreign funding steps in for late-stage rounds, frequently taking the tech to other countries.

Another pain point in deep tech is the reliance on education. A traditional startup leader only has two to three years of higher education. Deep tech requires about five to seven years due to the complexity of the subject matter. An overwhelming 81% of deep tech founders believe European investors lack the knowledge to really understand the in-depth details of their projects or goals.

There also simply isn’t enough money to offer. A European fund managing €150mn can write a few €10 to €15 mn checks, but that isn’t enough to build something as complex as a gigafactory or scale a new fusion plant. The mismatch of traditional VC funding with deep tech in Europe is what drives systemic underfunding, stalled startups, and the loss of world-changing innovations. There is a history of outside and foreign entities like Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and others picking up European tech talent to integrate into their R&D sectors. Those losses slow European deep tech advancement.

The evidence: when VC fails deep tech

The idea of mismatched VCs isn’t theoretical. There are many real-world examples of funding failures leading to Europe losing deep tech opportunities to international competitors. Here are just a few examples.

Prophesee in France

Prophesee creates neuromorphic vision sensors that enable machines to mimic human sight. The company raised €126mn over several rounds. However, in October of 2024, Prophesee entered judicial recovery after failing to secure additional funding. Even though the startup received massive global recognition for its technical validation (proof of concept), the length and uncertainty of financing led to complications in development.

Mycorena in Sweden

Mycorena had to file for bankruptcy and is now permanently closed. What began with the promise of mycelium-based protein that could be used in all kinds of industries failed after the startup couldn’t secure Series B funding in the mid-2020s. Mycorena was ultimately acquired for next to nothing, underscoring the hurdles deep tech companies encounter during scale-up.

Blickfeld in Germany

Blickfeld was an emerging leader in LiDAR, which enables autonomous vehicles to perceive their environment and operate safely. The company raised a total of €68mn — including €15mn from the European Investment Bank (EIB). But in June 2024, Blickfeld had to file for insolvency. Revenue came in too slowly to meet the demands of patient capital.

There are many other examples of investment shortcomings undermining promising European tech firms. Take MaaS Global in Finland, best known for the Whim app, which burned through too much capital without a sustainable business model. Or Sweden’s Northvolt, whose battery manufacturing business failed even with a blended funding model.

The pattern is strikingly consistent: funding dries up when capital needs spike and investors push for exits while R&D is still trying to work out the final solution. Meanwhile, public funding fails to arrive in time, and technical ambition is quickly sacrificed on the altar of short-term vitality. History is repeating itself, and deep tech is losing out.

What’s emerging instead: new investment models

For Europe to capitalise on deep tech, change must happen — and happen fast. New funding models and structures are required to meet the sector’s needs. Alternative solutions could be the final leg of the journey to overcome issues like the “valley of death” for deep tech. Which funding initiatives will get us there?

Government-backed & hybrid schemes. We need to replicate the EIC’s investment strategy of grants, equity, and hybrid investments. The EIC Accelerators, for example, offer up to €17.5mn per company, and the new STEP Scale-up Scheme targets growth rounds of €10-30 million. Government-backed funds, such as Bpifrance and the German Zukunftsfonds, meanwhile, can help de-risk early innovation and fill funding gaps for deep tech.

Government-backed funds, such as Bpifrance and the German Zukunftsfonds, meanwhile, can help de-risk early innovation and fill funding gaps for deep tech. Public-private partnerships. Pooling resources is an important way to fund deep tech. When state, corporate, and private investors work together, they naturally expand the usable timeline of a development group, boosting financial support for proofs of concept and market launches.

Corporate Venture Capital (CVC). The strategic investment arms of companies like Volkswagen, Airbus, Siemens, and Bosch help fund deep tech. Not only do they offer financial support, but they also tend to have technical expertise and access to advanced equipment that can bring the technology to life. Lilium is a good example. The German eVTOL startup secured funding from grants and private players, having received €200mn from the Mobile Uplift Consortium.

Private wealth has also entered the deep tech space. Family offices like Strüngmann Brothers (BioNTech) can back companies from inception to scale. These entities are less constrained by traditional fund structures, allowing greater investment impact with stronger strategic alignment for the long term.

These entities are less constrained by traditional fund structures, allowing greater investment impact with stronger strategic alignment for the long term. Venture studios and university-linked funds. Deep tech venture studio ecosystems can ensure research from universities makes the leap to scalable businesses. Initiatives such as Fraunhofer Ventures in Germany, CERN Venture Connect in Switzerland, and Creative Destruction Lab in Oxford illustrate this approach. Another good example is Evergreen Capital Vehicles, which helps nurture science spinouts before they transition into commercially focused entities.

It is important to note that these funding models alone are still not enough. They help create vibrant, regional successes, but the fragmentation of industries leaves infrastructure gaps in different European countries. The concentration of sectors like aerospace in Germany, batteries in Sweden, and EIT deep tech talent in Spain only widens such gaps. Progress is encouraging, but geographical coverage must be balanced to overcome Europe’s “patchwork” of financial inefficiencies.

The missing innovation: financial tools still not used

Despite all these progressive financial models, truly innovative financial solutions remain largely absent from the deep tech ecosystem in Europe. Many think tanks, EU policy papers, and founder forums highlight the need for longer time-to-revenue projects and solutions to high upfront costs, but the current tools are not quite up to the task.

As of 2022, no European deep tech startup has successfully used IP-backed loans, R&D pre-purchase agreements, revenue-based financing, or advance market commitments. Such models are helpful, but have yet to tackle the challenges around scaling a business, time to market, and elevated risk profiles.

The dominance of traditional financial models exists because grants, equity rounds, and hybrid public-private schemes cannot account for regulatory uncertainty, lack of institutional experience, and risk aversion.

As a result, Europe is falling behind and will continue to do so until financial innovation moves from theoretical idea to practical application. The good news is that such adaptation is already happening elsewhere, providing a framework for Europe to follow.

Global contrast: what works elsewhere

The US and Israel are turning deep tech into operational success using practical funding tools. Take Helion Energy in the US. The company has developed advanced fusion systems and recently raised $425mn to advance this technology over the next three years. Funding milestones were introduced to de-risk capital and support pre-purchase contracts.

Another example of adaptive funding fueling deep tech success is Climeworks. The company has benefited from revenue-based financing through corporate carbon offset agreements. Thanks to the predictable revenue streams, investors like Microsoft and Stripe have been able to provide funding crucial for scaling Climeworks’ direct air capture technology.

Innovative funding has also boosted Israel’s Phantom Energy. The company is using IP-backed loans to enable prototyping without dilution, leveraging patents as collateral. In every case, the funding tool is designed to “match” the technology. Europe can learn from these successes. With flexible funding that accommodates longer development cycles and eases failure risks, the continent will progress further in deep tech.

What Europe needs to change

If Europe wants a seat at the deep tech table, it needs to change. Incremental steps, like the examples listed above, won’t be enough. Insufficient patient capital with too many funds operating on short, exit-driven cycles must give way to new models. In their place, we need pan-European “evergreen” funds, growth-stage vehicles, and public-private platforms.

Fund sizes remain too small, and financial innovation is lacking. To address this, Europe needs well-publicised pilot projects involving creative investment models, such as IP-backed finance and non-dilutive hybrid modelling.

If Europe fosters greater collaboration and co-investment, we can reduce fragmentation and harmonise regulations. This could speed up grant distribution and create international “fast lanes” that shift the culture from fear of risk to celebrating experimentation.

Bold action is necessary to streamline bureaucracy and build technical investing talent that feeds both VCs and deep tech startups. We must change the culture. The deep tech investment ecosystem urgently needs to adapt to unlock the sector’s potential.

From paradox to progress

Europe has a world-class science community and a vibrant startup scene. To ensure success and stop promising projects from moving abroad, direct action is needed to scale deep tech ventures and address structural funding gaps.

The classic venture capital solution doesn’t fit the deep tech sector. While new models and regional initiatives are emerging and achieving some success, critical pieces are still missing, especially in late-stage capital and financial innovation.

Europe must seize this pivotal moment to reshape its capital stack into one of patience, scale, and flexibility. That will foster resilient, world-leading companies. But it will take the collective work of policymakers, investors, and founders to move beyond theory and into actionable success.",,"Nikolay Shestak, Story By","vc, traditional, failing, models, tech, fix, european, deep, europe, investment, funding, financial, capital",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:58.505956+00:00,9a6ef7634a7892d15b43e8ab12e5383ce3c8728f5678969f68d30bd2c30957f1

The malicious code package looked no different than millions of others available in repositories such as NPM, PyPI, or GitHub, which regularly host malicious code uploaded by threat actors in supply-chain attacks. The code itself in the package was completely benign. The only trace of malice was a handful of natural-language sentences buried in a README.md file, which like all such files was included in the code package to provide basic information about its purpose, scope, and requirements.

That was the perfect place for the researchers to hide a prompt-injection, a class of AI attack that has emerged as the biggest single threat confronting the safety and security of AI chatbots. Developers frequently skim these files at most, decreasing the chances they’d notice the injection. Meanwhile, Gemini CLI could be expected to carefully read and digest the file in full.",,,"allow, commands, flaw, security, researchers, cli, gemini, tool, coding, hackers, run, nasty, code, threat, ai, package",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:37.544101+00:00,89491131b2c3a1fcc9fdf442c0195e8115f8a68fdebddb09aabaafa8265f9841
128,techcrunch.com,https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/resonate-international-lnc/lovart-is-building-ai-design-agent-that-augments-creative-teams-with-single-platform/,Lovart is building ‘AI design agent’ that augments creative teams with single platform,2025-07-30T08:59:32,"Former ByteDance exec’s startup generates complete brand campaigns from prompts, amasses 100K waitlist in five days

Lovart replaces fragmented design workflows with a single AI-native agent that understands briefs and delivers full creative campaigns — from brand kits to videos — in minutes.

San Francisco-based Lovart has emerged from stealth with what it calls the first “AI Design Agent” — a vertically integrated platform that automates the entire creative workflow from concept to final deliverables. The startup, founded by former ByteDance senior product director Melvin Chen, aims to compress what traditionally requires multiple designers, tools, and weeks of iteration into a single automated process.

The platform can generate comprehensive creative assets including brand identity systems, UI mockups, video content, and packaging designs from a single text prompt. All outputs are delivered in professional formats compatible with industry-standard tools like Figma, Photoshop, and After Effects.

“Every startup hits the same wall: you have the product vision, but translating that into professional creative assets requires a full agency or months of DIY work,” Chen explained to TechCrunch. “We’re essentially democratizing access to enterprise-level creative capabilities.”

Technical differentiation through “creative reasoning”

Lovart’s core innovation is what the company calls MCoT (Mind Chain of Thought) — a reasoning engine designed to mimic how creative directors approach projects. Rather than simply generating aesthetically pleasing outputs, the system analyzes business context, target audience, and brand requirements to produce strategically appropriate creative work.

The platform’s architecture centers on a sophisticated multi-agent system where specialized AI agents handle different design disciplines while maintaining seamless coordination. The system draws inspiration from distributed AI research, similar to approaches outlined in Anthropic’s multi-agent research systems, where complex tasks are decomposed across specialized agents without losing contextual information.

“We break down a brand campaign into discrete creative tasks — logo design, color palette, typography, layout, motion graphics — and assign each to a specialized agent,” Melvin said. “The key innovation is our context synchronization layer that ensures all agents understand the overarching brand strategy and visual direction, so outputs feel cohesive rather than fragmented.”

For instance, when creating a product launch campaign, the system might deploy a brand strategy agent to establish visual guidelines, a layout agent for web design, a motion agent for video content, and a packaging agent for physical products.

Canvas as contextual intelligence

Beyond multi-agent coordination, Lovart introduces what it calls “canvas as context,” where the AI continuously analyzes all assets present on the user’s infinite canvas to provide increasingly relevant suggestions and iterations.

“Traditional design tools treat each asset in isolation,” said Melvin. “Our canvas understands the relationship between every element. If you’re working on a poster and have brand guidelines nearby, the AI automatically incorporates those constraints. If you’re iterating on a logo, it considers how that logo will work across the packaging designs you created earlier.”

This contextual awareness allows the AI to provide real-time design recommendations, suggest complementary assets, and maintain visual consistency across complex projects without explicit user instruction.

Strategic design thinking meets tactical execution

The platform combines high-level design thinking with granular tactical execution through what Lovart calls “strategy-to-pixel” automation. The system first operates at a strategic level, starting by analyzing the market positioning, competitive landscape, and target audience, before translating those insights into specific creative tactics.

“Most design tools focus on execution — make this logo bigger, change this color,” Melvin noted. “We start with the why: What business problem are we solving? Who’s the audience? What’s the competitive context? Then we automatically translate that strategic framework into tactical design decisions.”

A key differentiator is Lovart’s ability to learn from user preferences and build design memory over time. When users import assets, whether brand guidelines, reference images, or inspiration materials, the platform automatically analyzes, categorizes, and tags these elements for future use. The system intelligently surfaces relevant assets in appropriate contexts, ensuring brand consistency without manual intervention.

“If you upload a color palette for your startup’s brand, Lovart doesn’t just store it. It understands the emotional tone, the market positioning it implies, and automatically applies those insights to future projects,” Melvin explained. “It’s like having a design team that remembers every conversation and creative decision.”

The platform builds both short-term and long-term user memory. Short-term memory captures project-specific preferences and iterations within a campaign, while long-term memory develops a comprehensive understanding of the user’s design aesthetic, preferred workflows, and brand sensibilities across multiple projects.

This personalization engine means that over time, Lovart becomes increasingly attuned to individual creative styles and business contexts, delivering outputs that feel less like generic AI generation and more like collaboration with a familiar creative partner who understands the user’s vision.

“Most AI design tools are point solutions,” Melvin explained. “We’re building the end to end solution for creative work — think like design agencies, but with the intelligence to understand both creative strategy and tactical execution.”

Users can also import existing brand assets or rough sketches for the AI to refine and expand upon, with the multi-agent system automatically distributing refinement tasks while preserving the original creative intent.

Viral adoption signals market demand

Lovart’s invite-only beta launched in late May, but gained significant attention after a user’s AI-generated coffee chain brand system went viral, accumulating over 1 million views across social platforms. Within five days, the startup’s waitlist grew to 100,000 users across 70+ countries.

Lovart’s invite-only beta now boasts over 800,000 users — a rare feat for a design platform driven entirely by community referrals and viral adoption.

The company has fostered an active community around “Agent Battles” on Discord, where designers challenge the AI in real-time creative competitions. Early enterprise customers include several Y Combinator startups and growth-stage companies looking to reduce creative production costs.

“It’s helped us create stronger creative briefs and iterate faster on campaign concepts,” said Pius Binder, founder of Subscribe.fyi and former growth lead at Meta and Canva. “The infinite canvas interface feels familiar but the AI capabilities are genuinely next-level.”

Market positioning and funding

While Lovart hasn’t disclosed funding details, the company is reportedly backed by several prominent investors. Melvin previously led product initiatives at ByteDance that reached hundreds of millions of users, giving him experience scaling AI-powered creative tools.

The AI design tool market has seen significant investment recently, with companies like Runway AI raising $237 million and Midjourney reaching a $5 billion valuation. However, most existing players focus on specific creative verticals rather than end-to-end workflow automation.

Lovart faces competition from established players like Canva (valued at $40 billion) and Adobe’s expanding AI offerings, as well as newer entrants like Figma’s AI features and various specialized AI design startups.

Industry implications

The platform represents a broader shift toward AI agents that can handle complex, multi-step workflows rather than simple task automation. If successful, it could significantly impact the traditional creative agency model, which typically requires large teams and substantial budgets for comprehensive campaigns.

“We’re not trying to replace human creativity,” Melvin said. “We’re building the infrastructure that lets one creative person do the work of an entire agency. In five years, every creative team will have an AI teammate.”

Such an outbreak is not particularly surprising; the reason the vast majority of milk is pasteurized (heated briefly to kill germs) is because milk can easily pick up nasty pathogens in the farmyard that can cause severe illnesses, particularly in children. It's the reason public health officials have long and strongly warned against consuming raw milk.

At the time of the press release, officials in San Diego County had identified nine residents who had been sickened in the outbreak. Of those nine, three were children, and all three children had been hospitalized.

On October 25, the county put out a second press release, reporting that the local case count had risen to 12, and the suspected culprit—raw milk and raw cream from Raw Farm LLC—had been recalled. The same day, Orange County's health department put out its own press release, reporting seven cases among its residents, including one in a 1-year-old infant.

Both counties noted that the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), which had posted the recall notice, was working on the outbreak, too. But it doesn't appear that CDPH ever followed up with its own press release about the outbreak. The CDPH did write social media posts related to the outbreak: One on October 26, 2023, announced the recall; a second on November 30, 2023, noted ""a recent outbreak"" of Salmonella cases from raw milk but linked to general information about the risks of raw milk; and a third on December 7, 2023, linked to general information again with no mention of the outbreak.

But that seems to be the extent of the information at the time. For anyone paying attention, it might have seemed like the end of the story. But according to the final outbreak investigation report—produced by CDPH and local health officials—the outbreak actually ran from September 2023 to March 2024, spanned five states, and sickened at least 171 people.

Based at TNW City in Amsterdam, Lalaland quickly made waves — and sparked debate — after launching its customisable, realistic AI avatars in 2019. They’re pitched as a way for brands to save money while showcasing more diversity in their advertisements.

Browzwear, best known for developing 3D design tools that let fashion brands prototype clothes without making physical samples, was already a Lalaland user before the acquisition. CEO Greg Hanson said the company is now bringing the Lalaland team fully “in-house.”

“Our customers want absolute confidence in their digital twins,” he continued. “Lalaland’s hyper-realistic, diverse AI models supercharge that trust and dramatically cut the time between concept and commerce.”

Singapore-based Browzwear will integrate Lalaland’s AI team into its R&D division, where they’ll focus on improving the accuracy of virtual body shapes for better fit prediction. They’ll also use AI to generate diverse, size-inclusive model avatars and automate product imagery, reducing the need for traditional photo shoots.

These efforts aim to boost Browzwear’s flagship digital twin software, which enables designers to create a virtual version of a garment — complete with fit, fabric, and style — just minutes after sketching the idea.

Michael Musandu, co-founder and CEO of Lalaland, said that when the company first started working with Browzwear, “the synergy was obvious.”

“Joining forces now is a no-brainer,” he added.

Musandu, who was born in Zimbabwe, co-founded Lalaland after growing frustrated by the lack of representation in fashion modelling. “One model does not represent everyone that’s actually shopping and buying a product,” he told the Associated Press last year. “As a person of colour, I felt this painfully myself.”

Yet the use of AI-generated avatars has also sparked controversy. In March 2023, denim brand Levi’s revealed plans to test Lalaland’s AI-generated avatars to showcase more diverse body types and underrepresented groups on its website.

The move led to accusations that Levi’s was looking for a shortcut to the commercial benefits of diversity. A few days after the announcement, the brand put out another statement saying that it remains committed to live photo shoots, real models, and authentic diversity.

Musandu, meanwhile, insists that Lalaland was never designed to replace traditional photo shoots — or human models.

“We believe human models will continue to play a vital role in the fashion industry, establishing genuine connections with consumers; our technology aims to support this,” he said shortly after the Levi’s controversy.

“And, yes — we need more of them to come from underrepresented groups if fashion companies are serious about inclusion efforts.”",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","lalalands, dutch, models, fashion, startup, levis, diverse, model, avatars, browzwear, aigenerated, snaps, lalaland, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:05.004461+00:00,dcf16ad3faa997682fed9268effd889bbbfb05eaedd08520c4dec8c48c966e8e

Dubbed Cleo 3.0, the new version introduces features such as voice interaction, long-term memory, and improved reasoning capabilities.

Barney Hussey-Yeo, Cleo’s founder and chief executive, said Cleo 3.0 is less chatbot and more “conversational AI money coach.” Users can now have real-time voice conversations with Cleo, which the company says makes financial help feel more natural and accessible.

“Cleo remembers your goals, learns your habits, and delivers personalised financial guidance previously only available to the wealthy,” said Hussey-Yeo, who founded the fintech in 2016.

You connect the app to your bank account, and Cleo uses AI to look at your spending, income, and habits. Then “she” gives you helpful insights, like how much you can afford to spend this week or where you’re overspending.

The tool now allows users to speak with the assistant, which responds in natural language and draws on past interactions to deliver tailored advice. For example, you can ask, “Can I afford to go out this weekend?” and it’ll give you an answer based on your current balance and bills.

“Cleo 3.0 represents more than just a product update — it signals a shift in what we should expect from financial technology,” said Hussey-Yeo. “The AI revolution won’t be defined by who builds the largest models, but by who applies intelligence to solve the hardest, most human problems.”

The app is powered by OpenAI’s o3 model and uses chain-of-thought reasoning to break down complex financial decisions. Cleo claims its user engagement is 20 times higher than that of traditional banking apps.

The company expects to exceed 1 million paid subscribers this year, with annual recurring revenue (ARR) reaching $250mn — an 82% increase on 2024. However, Hussey-Yeo said in a LinkedIn post last week that “$500mn ARR is around the corner.”

About this time last year, prescription MDMA looked like a sure thing. After decades of clinical research, political wrangling, and aggressive promotion, the popular underground club drug was set to be tamed and medicalized, with a stamp of approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Then, it wasn’t.

In a stark change of course, the FDA rejected the MDMA therapy it had been considering by a 10-1 vote. The decision derailed psychedelic medicine for the foreseeable future.

Except for one thing—an unexpected lifeline from the Trump administration. In May, the FDA’s new commissioner, surgical oncologist Marty Makary, appeared on cable news to declare MDMA and other Schedule 1 narcotics “a top priority for this FDA and this administration.” Elsewhere, Mr. MAHA himself, the US Health and Human Services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has spoken positively about the psychoactive stems-and-bark tea ayahuasca. Matt Zorn, a lawyer recently appointed to RFK Jr.’s department, had previously fought the US government to allow access to cannabis and psychedelic mushrooms. Casey Means, Trump’s nominee for surgeon general, has spoken of the benefits of psilocybin-assisted therapy, claiming that psychedelic mushrooms helped her find love and made her feel like “part of an infinite and unbroken series of cosmic nesting dolls.”

Psychedelic medicine, as it turns out, slots rather comfortably into the burn-it-all ethos of RFK Jr.’s movement. But as MDMA’s advocates regroup to take advantage of this surge of support, they’re also reckoning with why they failed to win over the FDA—and whether a second attempt could go better. Could the psychedelic world’s new Trumpworld allies be the ones who finally help it achieve its goal?

For almost half a century, American psychedelic medicine—and MDMA in particular—has had one indispensable advocate: Rick Doblin. On a cool December morning, I met Doblin at his bright purple craftsman home in the Boston suburbs. Dressed in a well-worn chamois shirt and khakis and with a wiry tangle of hair, he was cheery and avuncular.

Proton VPN reported a staggering 1,400% surge in UK sign-ups almost immediately after the Online Safety Act came into effect. It is now Britain’s most downloaded free app, overtaking ChatGPT, according to Apple’s App Store rankings.

The Switzerland-based virtual private network (VPN) said in a post on X that the surge in interest has been “sustained.” This contrasts with recent short-term spikes, such as when people in France temporarily lost access to adult sites like Pornhub and RedTube last month due to new legislation.

The surge in downloads follows the UK government’s rollout of the Online Safety Act, which came into effect after midnight on Friday, July 25. The law requires websites such as Pornhub, Reddit, and TikTok to implement strict age verification measures, including uploading an official ID or using third-party identity checks.

The act is an attempt to protect minors from accessing harmful or adult content online. However, VPNs provide a relatively easy way to circumvent the new law. By masking a user’s location, they can make it appear as if internet users are accessing the web from outside the UK, where the new law doesn’t apply.

Ofcom, the UK’s communications regulator, has warned against using VPNs to sidestep the new rules. Meanwhile, Katie Freeman-Tayler of children’s safety group Internet Matters has raised concerns about how easily children can access VPNs.

“This makes it easy for them to circumvent important protections introduced under the Online Safety Act, such as age checks designed to shield them from adult content,” she told the BBC.

Proton isn’t the only company benefiting from the new law. Of the top ten free apps in Apple’s UK ranking, six are currently VPN services. They include Yoti, NordVPN, and Free VPN.

“We would normally associate these large spikes in sign-ups with major civil unrest,” Proton said in a statement. “This clearly shows that adults are concerned about the impact universal age verification laws will have on their privacy.”

Proton and other tech firms have previously criticised aspects of the Online Safety Act, warning the law could erode user privacy by forcing companies to scan private messages or break end-to-end encryption.

Criticism has also come from political quarters. Nigel Farage, leader of right-wing political party Reform UK, pledged this week to repeal the rules, labelling them “authoritarian” and a threat to free speech. A separate petition to overturn the Online Safety Act has racked up over 350,000 signatures, triggering a parliamentary review.

Growing demand for VPNs, meanwhile, has sparked fears that the government could ban the services. Security experts, however, have downplayed the concerns. “The UK won’t ban VPNs,” Jake Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at Slovakian software firm ESET, said on X. “It would be nearly impossible, and it would dramatically disrupt legitimate use.”",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","uk, act, adult, rises, vpns, safety, app, age, free, charts, vpn, kick, proton, porn, checks, law, online",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:17.419498+00:00,0ca3b5f4102a64c83fbdfc42d410e20d6a2d86f364303d1f0efb5c3a15c39059

""I was on the crew that needed to count the pieces,"" he told Ars. ""I didn’t know the significance of what was happening until after many years, but the Chinese had clearly changed the nature of the space environment.""

The 2007 anti-satellite test also clearly changed the trajectory of Agrawal's career. We present part of our discussion with Agrawal below, and we'll share the rest of the conversation later this week. The text has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.

Ars: The Space Force's role in monitoring activities in space has changed a lot in the last few years. Can you tell me about these changes, and what's the difference between what you used to call Space Situational Awareness, and what is now called Space Domain Awareness?

Agrawal: We just finished our fifth year as a Space Force, so as a result of standing up a military service focused on space, we shifted our activities to focus on what the joint force requires for combat space power. We've been doing space operations for going on seven decades. I think a lot of folks think that it was a rebranding, as opposed to a different focus for space operations, and it couldn’t be further from the truth. Compared to Space Domain Awareness (SDA), Space Situational Awareness (SSA) is kind of the knowledge we produce with all these sensors, and anybody can do space situational awareness. You have academia doing that. You've got commercial, international partners, and so on. But Space Domain Awareness, Gen. [John ""Jay""] Raymond coined the term a couple years before we stood up the Space Force, and he was trying to get after, how do we create a domain focused on operational outcomes? That's all we could say at the time. We couldn't say war-fighting domain at the time because of the way of our policy, but our policy shifted to being able to talk about space as a place where, not that we want to wage war, but that we can achieve objectives, and do that with military objectives in mind.

We used to talk about detect, characterize, attribute, predict. And then Gen. [Chance] Saltzman added target onto the construct for Space Domain Awareness, so that we're very much in the conversation of what it means to do a space-enabled attack and being able to achieve objectives in, from, and to space, and using Space Domain Awareness as a vehicle to do those things. So, with Mission Delta 2, what he did is he took the sustainment part of acquisition, software development, cyber defense, intelligence related to Space Domain Awareness, and then all the things that we were doing in Space Domain Awareness already, put all that together under one command ... and called us Mission Delta 2. So, the 18th Space Defense Squadron ... that used to kind of be the center of the world for Space Domain Awareness, maybe the only unit that you could say was really doing SDA, where everyone else was kind of doing SSA. When I came into command a couple years ago, and we face now a real threat to having space superiority in the space domain, I disaggregated what we were doing just in the 18th and spread out through a couple of other units ... So, that way everyone's got kind of majors and minors, but we can quickly move a mission in case we get tested in terms of cyber defense or other kinds of vulnerabilities.",,,"copheres, domain, say, doing, awareness, used, mission, spoke, objectives, militarys, kind, space, learned, orbital, situational, traffic, chief, ars",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:40.212812+00:00,2ac66c9d8d640fce9ba54aab777833d424f2764179240ed1e741f7f9eaba98fb

The technology, called Dynamic Targeting, was tested by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) earlier this month. It was installed aboard a briefcase-sized satellite built and operated by UK-based startup Open Cosmos, and carried a machine learning processor developed by Dublin-based firm Ubotica.

In the test, the satellite tilted forward to scan 500km ahead of its orbit and snapped a preview image. Ubotica’s AI quickly analysed the scene to check for cloud cover. If the skies were clear, the satellite tilted back to take a detailed photo of the surface. If clouds obscured the view, it skipped the shot — saving time, storage, and bandwidth.

“If you can be smart about what you’re taking pictures of, then you only image the ground and skip the clouds,” said Ben Smith of JPL, which funds the Dynamic Targeting work. “This technology will help scientists get a much higher proportion of usable data.”

Brian Quinn, chief strategy officer at Ubotica, said that until now, satellites have merely acted as passive data collectors. They image whatever happens to be beneath them and beam all that data — useful or not — back to Earth. Scientists then sort through the backlog.

“It takes post-processing, which could be days later, to say, ‘Hey, there was a fire. Hey, there was a harmful algal bloom’,” said Quinn in an article published on NASA’s website earlier this year.

NASA, Ubotica, and OpenCosmos say the system could also be expanded to spot wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and severe storms faster than ever before from space.

The recent test builds on previous partnerships involving the three parties. In 2021, Ubotica demonstrated real-time AI cloud detection aboard the International Space Station (ISS) as part of a broader research collaboration with JPL. Then, in 2024, Open Cosmos launched HAMMER, an AI-powered satellite equipped with a hyperspectral camera and Ubotica’s machine learning processor.",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","jpl, decisions, used, tech, image, satellite, uboticas, technology, tilted, space, test, ubotica, ai",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:02.915670+00:00,a331a8d3f6d06e5a2dadc3db0b989d93e3716ab1edd47f40e679de185b6d373e

In April, Intel attempted to announce layoffs without announcing layoffs. “We have not set any headcount reduction target,” Intel spokesperson Sophie Metzger told The Verge. But the company has laid off thousands of employees since — and today, in the company’s Q2 2025 earnings, it has revealed that Intel will dramatically shrink as a result of those layoffs. Intel says it will retreat from planned projects in Germany and Poland, end its assembly and test operations in Costa Rica, and finish 2025 with just around 75,000 “core employees” in total.

Intel employed 109,800 people at the end of 2024, of which 99,500 were “core employees,” so the company is pushing out around 24,000 people this year — shrinking Intel by roughly one-quarter. (It has also divested other businesses, shrinking the larger organization as well.)

Today, on the company’s earnings call, Intel’s CEO says that Intel had overinvested in new factories before it had secured enough demand, that its factories had become “needlessly fragmented,” and that it needs to grow its capacity “in lock step” with achieving actual milestones.

“I do not subscribe to the belief that if you build it, they will come. Under my leadership, we will build what customers need when they need it, and earn their trust,” says Tan.

Now, in Germany and Poland, where Intel was planning to spend tens of billions of dollars respectively on “mega-fabs” that would employ 3,000 workers, and on an assembly and test facility that would employ 2,000 workers, the company will “no longer move forward with planned projects” and is apparently axing them entirely.

Intel has had a presence in Poland since 1993, however, and the company did not say its R&D facilities there are closing. (Intel had previously pressed pause on the new Germany and Poland projects “by approximately two years” back in 2024.)

In Costa Rica, where Intel employs over 3,400 people, the company will “consolidate its assembly and test operations in Costa Rica into its larger sites in Vietnam.” Metzger tells The Verge that over 2,000 Costa Rica employees should remain to work in engineering and corporate, though.

The company is also cutting back in Ohio: “Intel will further slow the pace of construction in Ohio to ensure spending is aligned with market demand.” Intel CFO David Zinsner says Intel will continue to make investments there, though, and construction will continue.

It’s not clear if the layoffs will slow now that we’re over halfway through the year, but Intel states today that it has already “completed the majority of the planned headcount actions it announced last quarter to reduce its core workforce by approximately 15 percent.”

So far, partially because of the $1.9 billion that Intel is incurring to do these layoffs and this restructuring, Intel is still losing money this quarter. It’s reporting a $2.9 billion loss on $12.9 billion in quarterly revenue (which is itself flat year over year). Amid the ongoing AI boom, Intel’s data center business is only up 4 percent year over year to $3.9 billion, while its PC chips are down 3 percent to $7.9 billion. Intel’s foundry business, where it does chipmaking for other customers as well, is up 3 percent to $4.4 billion.

The company says it’s on track to shrink its expenses by $17 billion over the full year, and that at least one of its next flagship laptop chips is on track, too: “The first Panther Lake processor SKU remains on track to begin shipping later this year, with additional SKUs coming in the first half of 2026.”

Intel’s follow-up, Nova Lake, is still on track for the end of 2026, according to Tan, and he says he has “taken steps to correct past mistakes regarding multi-threading capabilities” in the company’s Performance cores there. What’s more, Tan says he’s personally taking on responsibility for each new chip design with a new policy that he says is already in effect: “every major chip design needs to be personally reviewed and approved by me before tape out.”

Meanwhile, Intel says it’s also ramping its popular but previously expensive Lunar Lake chips this next quarter.

Tan says he will also announce new leadership for Intel’s data center business next quarter, and will share more on its strategy for a full-stack AI solution “in the coming months.”

Correction, July 24th: We originally incorrectly calculated that Intel would shed around 33,000 employees, but the actual total should be closer to 24,000. (Intel stated it would end the year with 75,000 core employees, but the 108,900 number we originally compared to was last year’s total headcount including other related businesses, not Intel core headcount, which was 99,500.)",,Sean Hollister,"track, poland, intels, layoffs, 24000, intel, rica, employees, billion, core, countries, laying, company, retreating",pending,2025-08-15T23:52:33.458309+00:00,01dc433776663305c44f59d263f6f33a4a330dc71be4a29abd770d899061f5f5

This has been the line from Apple executives, from its initial introduction to the advent of touchscreen PCs to just last month when Apple’s Craig Federighi talked to us about iPadOS 26’s new multitasking features.

But it sometimes feels like this internal commitment to keeping the devices separate has held the iPad back as its hardware has become more capable. A mouse cursor? Sure, we’ll add it, after a few years of insisting on keyboard-and-finger interactions, but we’ll make it round and imprecise instead of pointy because the iPad is Different. Windowed multitasking? Sure, we’ll give you a version of it, but you can’t do whatever you want with the windows, and we’ll tie it to a weird new interface for grouping them, because the iPad is Different.

I respect the desire not to take the path of least resistance here, which would be to imitate the Mac by default without trying to do anything new. And it’s not like you could just move macOS elements over totally unchanged; having a touch-first user interface and touch-first apps means the iPad’s system needs to work well with both touch and a keyboard-and-mouse/trackpad setup. It needs to work well in landscape and portrait modes.

But different for different’s sake isn’t good either! I’m not saying that the classic windowed multitasking model, as popularized by macOS and Windows, is the pinnacle of UI design, but it has persisted both because it works well and because it’s what a lot of people are used to.

Google is readying its next set of hardware announcements, and has already confirmed that the Pixel 10 series is launching this month. We even know what two of the phones look like, thanks to official teasers from Google.

But beyond the few tidbits Google has shared officially, there’s an awful lot more we think we know about the Pixel 10 line thanks to leaks, from which phones are arriving — likely the 10, 10 Pro, 10 Pro XL, and 10 Pro Fold — to camera changes, US prices, and maybe even some long overdue Qi2 support.

What we know officially

Let’s start with some stone-cold facts. We know that the Pixel 10 line will be announced at a Made by Google event in New York on August 20th, where the company will show off “the latest on our Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more.”

We also know that one of the phones in the lineup will look like the image above, including that blue-gray finish. Color aside, that phone looks almost identical to the Pixel 9 Pro, right down to the flash and temperature sensor inside the camera bar, confirming that Google isn’t changing its design language.

You can also see a little more of it in action in this early ad, which doesn’t miss the excuse to dunk on Apple for its repeated Apple Intelligence delays.

We’ve had a pretty similar tease for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which mostly shows that the foldable a) comes in the same grayish color as the other model, and b) otherwise looks an awful lot like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.

That’s about all Google has said for certain, but here’s everything else we’re expecting to see at the launch later this month.

Triple cameras all around

The biggest surprise this year appears to be a move to upgrade the base Pixel 10 to a triple rear camera, including a telephoto lens for the first time, bringing it in line with the three Pro models.

But before you get too excited, know that there are some downsides. To offset the added cost — and perhaps to give you a reason to consider the upgrade to the Pro — Google will reportedly downgrade the Pixel 10’s other cameras.

Android Authority reports that Google is using smaller sensors for the Pixel 10’s main camera and ultrawide than the Pixel 9 had, meaning the cameras will capture less light. In fact, it will apparently use the same sensors it did on the Pixel 9A. That means that unless Google has made improvements elsewhere, the Pixel 10’s main and ultrawide cameras will be worse than on the 9, but offset by the addition of the telephoto lens. At least the selfie camera should remain unchanged.

It also means the triple cameras on the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL — which will apparently be unchanged from the 9 Pro models — could be superior to the 10 across the board. The 10 Pro Fold camera will be comparable to the 10’s, using the same sensors for its main and telephoto shooters, and similarly specced ones for the selfie and ultrawide. That represents a very slight upgrade to the main camera in the Fold, but the base 10 is the only model getting a real camera overhaul.

Contrasting colors

Google may also be making unexpected decisions about the phones’ colors, going by allegedly official renders leaked by Android Headlines.

Previous Next





1 / 4 The Pixel 10 colors look especially bright this year. Image: Android Headlines

On the base Pixel 10 that means brighter colors than ever (and confirmation of that triple camera). The site reports that the phone will come in “Obsidian,” Google’s standard black finish, along with a vibrant blue called “Indigo,” a paler shade called “Frost,” and an almost fluorescent green dubbed “Limoncello.”

By contrast, the Pro models look muted. The 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL come in the same “Obsidian” black, plus the returning “Porcelain” white, a soft green called “Jade,” and a gray-blue called “Moonstone.” You might recognize that shade from Google’s official image up at the top.

Stranger are the colors for the 10 Pro Fold. Android Headlines reports that it only comes in two variants, but unlike last year those aren’t black and white. Instead, the Fold will apparently only be available in “Moonstone” and “Jade,” making it the rare phone to not launch in black at all.

For more confirmation of those colors, another leaked image from the Play Store shows the full Pixel 10 lineup with the three Pro models all in “Moonstone” and the regular 10 in “Indigo.” Leaker Evan Blass has also shared multiple images of all the phones in two separate collections of leaked images on X.

Seeing them together really highlights how bright the base model is compared to the Pros. Image: Android Authority

Qi2 charging

In July, the Wireless Power Consortium announced Qi2 25W, a faster version of the magnetic wireless charging standard, and promised support from “major Android smartphones.” We think that means the Pixel 10 line.

Google hasn’t supported Qi2 on its previous Pixels, but there are good reasons to think that might be about to change.

The first is that Android Authority reported in June that Google is preparing an ecosystem of magnetic Qi2 accessories under the “Pixelsnap” brand, including two chargers and a stand. This has been followed by later leaks of Pixelsnap cases with rings for magnets, and a recent image of a magnetic charging puck shared by Blass.

This sure looks like a magnetic wireless charger. Image: evleaks

That latter leak is arguably the most important. While it had previously been thought that Google might follow Samsung in certifying its phones Qi2 Ready, meaning they would support Qi2 charging but not contain the magnets, this image shows a charger attaching magnetically to the phone itself, which implies full Qi2 support, magnets and all.

For more evidence of that, we have the size of the new handsets. Android Headlines claims to have the official dimensions and weights of all four phones, and each is heavier than the previous generation, and all but the XL are thicker, too.

This could just be because the phones will have bigger batteries, which several reports have suggested. But Google could also be making space for the magnets required to enable Qi2 support.

The first IP68 foldable

One rumor that’s circulated for a while is that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first foldable phone to pack an IP68 rating.

By comparison, Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Motorola Razr Ultra both have IP48 ratings. That means they’re protected against objects larger than 1mm, but the 10 Pro Fold bumps that up to complete protection against dust and particulates — the highest possible rating for dust protection on the IP scale — while maintaining a high water-resistance rating too.

So far, no foldable phone has achieved that level of dust and particle protection, whether sold in the US or otherwise, suggesting that this has involved a pretty impressive feat of engineering on Google’s part to protect the phone’s delicate mechanisms entirely.

Chip upgrades

Boring, I know — every phone, every year, has a chipset upgrade. But we are expecting more from Google this time around.

Android Authority has repeatedly reported that for the new Tensor G5 chip Google is moving manufacturing from Samsung to TSMC, using the same 3nm N3E process Apple uses for the iPhone 16 Pro’s A18 Pro chip. Together with some tweaks to the core layout, that’s expected to produce a significant boost in processing power, closing the gap between Pixels and the competition.

AI everywhere

Android Authority reports that Google is developing several new AI imaging features, though some may be for next year’s Pixel 11. “Sketch-to-Image” will be the Pixel version of a feature already seen on Samsung phones, while “Speak-to-Tweak” should be a voice-based photo editing tool. The latter has more recently been reported by Android Headlines, which claims you’ll be able to use voice prompts for simple edits like “changing backgrounds, brightening images, or removing objects.”

Android Headlines reports that a new AI feature called “Camera Coach” will use Gemini to advise you as you’re taking shots, giving advice on adjusting camera angles or lighting to get a better photo before you take it.

Android Authority has also reported that the Pixel 10 will have a new virtual assistant called “Pixel Sense,” once rumored to be called “Pixie.” Pixel Sense will reportedly use information from other Google apps to complete tasks across your phone, make predictive suggestions to help you before you ask, and better learn your tastes from all that data. Impressively, that will all be processed on-device.

It sounds like a more powerful version of the multimodal actions Google added to Gemini in January, but going by the name, it sounds like a Pixel exclusive.

The Pixel 10 software will look a little different to before. Image: Google

These AI features should arrive alongside Android updates we’ve known about since Google I/O, like the big Material 3 Expressive redesign and a desktop mode based on Samsung’s DeX.

Familiar prices and a late Fold

If you’re worried that it sounds like Google hasn’t made many outright hardware upgrades this year, you may be reassured by news that they’re probably not changing their prices either. A leak from Android Headlines includes the alleged US pricing for all four phones, and it’s almost identical to last year’s.

Per rumors, the Pixel 10 will start at $799 for 128GB of storage, or $899 for 256GB. The 10 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB, rising all the way up to $1,449 for a 1TB option.

The two larger phones could be the only models with price changes. The 10 Pro XL may see a price bump from $1,099 to $1,199, but that’s only because Google has scrapped the phone’s 128GB option, starting at 256GB instead — and matching the 9 Pro XL’s pricing at that and higher storage tiers.

Meanwhile, the 10 Pro Fold may stick with a $1,799 starting price for 256GB of storage, but the leak suggests Google is adding a new 1TB option at $2,149.

The Fold may also go on sale separately from the other phones. A report from WinFuture, since echoed by Evan Blass, claims that due to “supply chain problems,” the Fold won’t go on sale until October 9th. The Pixel Watch 4 and Buds 2A will reportedly be late too, while the other three phones could hit stores on August 28th.

This makes it the fastest-ever software company to reach the milestone — eclipsing the historically rapid growth rates of companies such as Cursor and Wiz.

Lovable’s rise stems from the popularity of its generative AI platform. The system allows non-technical users to build apps or websites based on simple text prompts.

The platform is the brainchild of Anton Osika, who co-founded Lovable in 2023.

“I decided what we needed to do is build for the 99% who do not create software,” he told TNW in April.

By allowing non-technical founders to create successful businesses without any prior coding or software experience, Osika believes the company is “unlocking a new economy.”

Lovable has now reached over 2.3 million active users and seen more than 10 million projects built on its platform. According to the company, more than 100,000 new projects are being created each day.

Last week, Lovable announced a $200mn Series A round led by Accel, with participation from 20VC, byFounders, Creandum, Hummingbird, and Visionaries Club. The funding valued the startup at $1.8bn and ranks among the largest Series A rounds ever raised by a European company.

Lovable also revealed it is now “fully agentic,” giving the platform the ability to “think through problems, make plans, and proactively take actions like a real developer.” The upgrade enables Lovable to search the web for content, debug code, and edit applications with full context — all without human intervention.

The company has also launched a Business Plan offering “enterprise-grade security, privacy, and control,” which includes features like reusable templates, self-serve SSO, private projects, and data opt-out. Early customers include Klarna, Hubspot, and Photoroom.

“Despite our rapid growth, we are still just beginning to understand what this means for people and businesses around the world,” Osika said in a statement. “AI is unlocking the potential for people to build easily, create new companies at an unprecedented rate, and have a positive impact on the world.”",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","fastestgrowing, lovable, software, create, startup, projects, build, osika, coding, world, company, platform, ai, vibe",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:59.739493+00:00,e30161d37cc3e2c7a95f0037db3450d126c25079fb97178fe4e9bad14d118720

Everybody aboard the Research Vessel Garvin had come to Miami for the sharks—to catch them, sample them, and tag them, all in the name of science. People who once wanted to be marine biologists, actual marine biologists, shark enthusiasts, the man who literally wrote the book Why Sharks Matter, and various friends and family had spent much of the day sending fish heads set with hooks over the side of the Garvin. But each time the line was hauled back in, it came in slack, with nothing but half-eaten bait or an empty hook at the end.

And everyone was getting nervous.

I: “No assholes”

The Garvin didn't start out as a research vessel. Initially, it was a dive boat that took people to wrecks on the East Coast. Later, owner Hank Garvin used it to take low-income students from New York City and teach them how to dive, getting them scuba certified. But when Garvin died, his family put the boat, no longer in prime condition, on the market.

A thousand miles away in Florida, Catherine MacDonald was writing ""no assholes"" on a Post-it note.

At the time, MacDonald was the coordinator of a summer internship program at the University of Miami, where she was a PhD student. And even at that stage in her career, she and her colleagues had figured out that scientific field work had a problem.

""Science in general does not have a great reputation of being welcoming and supportive and inclusive and kind,"" said David Shiffman, author of the aforementioned book and a grad school friend of MacDonald's. ""Field science is perhaps more of a problem than that. And field science involving what are called charismatic megafauna, the big animals that everyone loves, is perhaps worse than that. It's probably because a lot of people want to do this, which means if we treat someone poorly and they quit, it's not going to be long before someone else wants to fill the spot.""",,,"day, field, garvin, miami, macdonald, biologist, shark, tagging, marine, goes, science, getting, research, vessel, sharks, ars",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:43.312815+00:00,c16b8405b53616b4d427f0799d1e9424037fa13ed7ad7035237893f60b0f9ca4

An investigation by 404 Media found that Spotify is releasing AI-generated songs on the pages of deceased artists — without approval from their estates or labels.

One such track, “Together,” recently appeared on the official page of Blake Foley, a country singer who was murdered in 1989. The song sounds vaguely similar to Foley’s style, but the accompanying image features a blonde, young man who looks nothing like him.

404 Media linked the track to a company account called Syntax Error, which was also responsible for several other seemingly fabricated numbers. One included “Happened To You,” a song supposedly performed by Grammy-winning country singer-songwriter Guy Clark, who died in 2016.

Spotify removed the unauthorised tracks after 404 Media’s report was published. However, while this is a particularly grim example of AI-generated music on the Swedish streaming platform, it’s not the first — and unlikely to be the last.

Last month, an AI-generated band called the Velvet Sundown popped up on Spotify. Its top track, “Dust on the Wind” — which sounds similar to the 1977 Kansas hit “Dust in the Wind” — has been played almost 2 million times since its release on June 20.

Velvet Sundown’s Spotify bio now describes the band as a “synthetic music project,” but the platform doesn’t label the tracks — or any other music — as AI-generated.

Daniel Ek, Spotify’s CEO, has taken a consistently laissez-faire approach to managing AI-generated content. Ek previously said that tracks created with AI were fair game on the platform — unless they mimicked real artists. However, Spotify seems to be doing a lousy job of identifying and removing these AI imitations as well, according to several reports.

The rise of AI-generated music on Spotify has sparked widespread backlash for several reasons. One involves the frequent use of AI tools like Suno or Udio, which generate entire tracks based on a simple text prompt. While the companies behind them claim that training their models on copyrighted music falls under “fair use,” opponents argue it amounts to copyright infringement. Critics also warn that AI-generated tracks compete for streams, reducing the share of royalties available to human artists.

Sophie Jones, the chief strategy officer at the music trade body the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), called for new protections in an interview with the Guardian last week.

“The rise of AI-generated bands and music entering the market points to the fact that tech companies have been training AI models using creative works — largely without authorisation or payment to creators and rights-holders — in order to directly compete with human artistry,” she said.

Another concern is that deceiving listeners with AI-generated profiles and songs is a form of misinformation that risks ruining the reputation of human artists.

To give creators a fair shot, Jones and others argue that streaming platforms should start by clearly labelling AI-generated content. That’s a move pioneered by rival streaming app Deezer, which has developed an algorithm that can identify artificially created songs made using several popular generative AI models, including Suno and Udio.

“AI is not inherently good or bad, but we believe a responsible and transparent approach is key to building trust with our users and the music industry,” Deezer’s CEO Alexis Lanternier said in June.

Order in the court! Judges are facing outcry over a suspected AI-generated order in a court.

Fueling nightmares that AI may soon decide legal battles, a Georgia court of appeals judge, Jeff Watkins, explained why a three-judge panel vacated an order last month that appears to be the first known ruling in which a judge sided with someone seemingly relying on fake AI-generated case citations to win a legal fight.

Now, experts are warning that judges overlooking AI hallucinations in court filings could easily become commonplace, especially in the typically overwhelmed lower courts. And so far, only two states have moved to force judges to sharpen their tech competencies and adapt so they can spot AI red flags and theoretically stop disruptions to the justice system at all levels.

The recently vacated order came in a Georgia divorce dispute, where Watkins explained that the order itself was drafted by the husband's lawyer, Diana Lynch. That's a common practice in many courts, where overburdened judges historically rely on lawyers to draft orders. But that protocol today faces heightened scrutiny as lawyers and non-lawyers increasingly rely on AI to compose and research legal filings, and judges risk rubberstamping fake opinions by not carefully scrutinizing AI-generated citations.

The errant order partly relied on ""two fictitious cases"" to deny the wife's petition—which Watkins suggested were ""possibly 'hallucinations' made up by generative-artificial intelligence""—as well as two cases that had ""nothing to do"" with the wife's petition.

Lynch was hit with $2,500 in sanctions after the wife appealed, and the husband's response—which also appeared to be prepared by Lynch—cited 11 additional cases that were ""either hallucinated"" or irrelevant. Watkins was further peeved that Lynch supported a request for attorney's fees for the appeal by citing ""one of the new hallucinated cases,"" writing it added ""insult to injury.""",,,"vacated, courts, frighteningly, judges, order, overlook, court, legal, wifes, cases, likely, aigenerated, expert, watkins, ai, errors",pending,2025-08-15T23:55:44.772685+00:00,3e810596fde848ff10140bc317a9dc1aae9e20d22942ec14bbe1c828c6e86299

Funding into newer tech firms remains complex, with Startup Genome reporting that while the Beijing, Los Angeles and Tokyo startup landscapes are seeing YoY growth, Paris is flat and the rest of the European ecosystem is in decline. Meanwhile, the technology landscape continues to evolve at an accelerating pace. As Deloitte’s 2025 Tech Trends report states: “technology optimisation and transformation have never been more important as innovation continues to fuel innovation.”

This is creating a landscape where large enterprises are struggling to be on the front foot of technology adoption, while juggling the impacts of economic and geopolitical uncertainty and shifting regulations. Meanwhile, startups are hustling to develop solutions to enterprise problems in an ecosystem with lower than usual venture capital investment. All in all: the zeitgeist is fast-paced, complicated, and confusing… but it’s pretty exciting to be part of what is truly a historic moment for the world’s relationship with technology.

As I shared with industry leaders at The Next Web’s ‘Innovating at Scale’ panel, this turbulence has forced a rethink of what it means to operate and innovate at scale. In this environment, resilience isn’t just about weathering storms; it’s about evolving in real time, making decisions with imperfect information and finding opportunity in volatility.

The reality of volatility: our experience

2024 was brutal for many in the technology sector. The industry whiplashed from pandemic-fuelled overhiring to a sharp correction, all while economic fragility tested even the strongest partnerships. Delayed payments, vanished purchase orders and a rise in ‘ghosting’ became the norm for suppliers, as organisations were increasingly pressured to deliver more with fewer resources.

Yet in 2025, amid the unpredictability, there is a palpable sense of renewal. We’re seeing a resurgence in growth-focused investment, which has materialized for us in the form of a spike in marketing and communications briefs, as businesses recalibrate for a world where resilience, agility and purpose are not optional extras but central to survival.

This is good news for the technology sector, and great news for Clarity as a technology focussed digital marketing and communications agency. But we’re not out of the woods yet and, as we discussed in my panel at The Next Web Conference, we all need to be playing multiple moves ahead.

Lessons from Innovation Under Pressure, the panel I hosted at The Next Web Conference 2025

At The Next Web, I was privileged to host a panel with leaders from organisations at the forefront of global innovation: Monika Tomczak-Górlikowska, Group Head of Privacy, Digital & Regulatory at Prosus Group (an ecosystem for lifestyle e-commerce entrepreneurs); Ernesto Lasalandra, Chief Research & Development Officer at Ferrari; Shez Partovi, Chief Innovation Officer and Chief Business Leader Healthcare Informatics, Philips; and Seth Dobrin, Co-Founding General Partner, 1Infinity Ventures (a global responsible AI fund). Their experiences underscored a universal truth that most in the business world have now accepted: innovation at scale is no longer a luxury, but a necessity.

A few key themes emerged:

1. Regulation is now a core business competency: Technology firms’ success demands that legal, privacy and cybersecurity voices are not just consulted, but embedded in the innovation process. Regulatory change and policy discussions must not be ignored, they are signals to prioritise, adapt and build solutions that will endure across borders and business models.

2. Partnership is the engine of progress: Whether it’s Ferrari’s open innovation approach, where thousands of startups are scrutinised for their potential to drive (pardon the pun) next-generation solutions, or Philips’ customer-driven partnerships to solve real-world pain points, the message is clear: innovation thrives in ecosystems not silos. The most transformative ideas solve genuine problems and are developed in collaboration with partners, suppliers and, most importantly, customers.

3. Culture is critical: Across the panel there was consensus that innovation must be woven into the fabric of the business, not siloed in a standalone team. This means cultivating a culture where experimentation is encouraged, failure is reframed as learning and agility is prized over perfection. Members of the panel flagged that an obsession with perfection was potentially a key boulder holding the European tech ecosystem from competing more strongly with the U.S. and key APAC markets. As Shez Partovi of Philips put it, “…if you don’t change your mind a lot, you’re probably wrong a lot.”

Now, Near, Next: Building resilience for whatever comes next

So, how can businesses not only survive, but thrive in this change-centric environment? At Clarity, we guide our clients to adopt a “Now, Near, Next” mindset, one that aligns immediate action with longer-term vision, all powered by data and relentless agility and adaptation.

The ‘Now’ is about managing risk and protecting reputation today. In an era of 24/7 scrutiny, every company is just one misstep away from a crisis. Clear, consistent communications and robust stakeholder engagement are the foundations of trust.

‘Near’ focuses on sustaining innovation and growth. This means investing in partnerships, nurturing talent through powerful employee communications and building the capacity to pivot when disruption strikes. Businesses must constantly be asking: what do we need to change in the next 12 months to stay relevant?

Finally, ‘Next’ is about future-proofing: embedding purpose, ethics and sustainability into strategy. As AI, regulation and societal expectations evolve, the winners will be those who anticipate change and act with conviction.

Influence the world, impact the future

Taking the ‘Now, Near, Next’ approach is not just a communications and marketing strategy, it’s a business imperative. The world isn’t slowing down, and neither can we. By embracing regulatory complexity, forging purposeful partnerships and building a culture of constant learning, businesses can not only navigate uncertainty, but define the future on their own terms. Because in a world of relentless change, Clarity isn’t just what we offer our clients, it’s what every business needs to move forward with confidence.",,"Rachel Gilley, Story By","ongoing, change, tech, panel, communications, partnerships, uncertainty, technology, requires, ecosystem, world, near, business, living, innovation, navigating",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:08.042606+00:00,c99dbad19689e5669ea44289fa9a769057349ef333d3936c819c3a86cf6998fe
244,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/synchron-neuralink-competitor-brain-computer-interfaces/,There’s Neuralink—and There’s the Mind-Reading Company That Might Surpass It,2025-07-21T10:00:00+00:00,"Mark Jackson is playing a computer game with his mind. As he reclines in bed, three blue circles appear on a laptop screen a few feet away. One turns red: the target. Jackson is in control of a white circle, which he needs to steer into the target without running into the blue obstacles. The game is a bit like Pac-Man. Except instead of a joystick, Jackson uses his thoughts to control his little white circle. To move left, he thinks about clenching his right fist once. To move right, he thinks about doing it twice in a row, like a double click.

Beyond Wellness The line between science and wellness has been blurred beyond recognition. WIRED is here to help.

Jackson, who is 65 and paralyzed, is good at this game. He steers into the red circle. It turns blue and makes a satisfying ding! He has hit the target. In the next round, the circles change position. He moves to the next round, and the next, and is successful 14 out of 15 times. He’s gotten 100 percent at this game before. Then again, he’s had some practice.

A couple years ago, surgeons in Pittsburgh implanted Jackson with an experimental brain-computer interface, or BCI. Made by New York–based startup Synchron, it decodes Jackson’s brain signals to carry out commands on the laptop and other devices. He’s one of 10 people—six in the US and four in Australia—who have received the Synchron implant as part of an early feasibility study. In addition to gaming, the BCI allows him to send text messages, write emails, and shop online.

Jackson’s medical saga began about five years ago, when he was living in Georgia and working for a wholesale floral company—his dream job. He thought he had pinched a nerve in his neck. But in January 2021, doctors at Emory University told him the diagnosis was far more serious: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A neurodegenerative disease, ALS causes nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord to break down over time, resulting in a gradual loss of muscle control. Jackson’s doctor asked if he was interested in joining a clinical trial testing an ALS drug. Jackson said it was a no-brainer.

But by December 2022, he had lost the ability to type or lift buckets of flowers at his job and had to stop working. He moved in with his brother just outside Pittsburgh. “The loss of mobility, the loss of independence that goes with this disease,” Jackson says, “it’s a lot to take in, it’s a lot to process.” He tried to stay positive even as his disease progressed. When the drug trial ended in summer 2023, he was eager to join another study that had a chance of helping his ALS.

Synchron’s BCI trial was just getting underway at the University of Pittsburgh. While the implant wouldn’t slow the progression of Jackson’s ALS, it could give him back some of the autonomy he’d lost to the disease. “I was immediately excited about it,” Jackson says.

He started the vetting process in July 2023, and six weeks later Jackson was in the operating room. In a roughly three-hour-long procedure, surgeons first inserted the Stentrode, a wire-mesh tube about the size of a matchstick, into his jugular vein at the base of his neck. Using a catheter, they carefully threaded the device up through the vessel, past the ear, and into the side of the head to rest against the motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement. Then they inserted a small rectangular device below Jackson’s collarbone, which processes the brain signals and beams them via infrared outside the body. Those signals are collected by a paddle-shaped receiver that sits on Jackson’s chest, then sent via a wire to a unit that translates them into commands. When the system is hooked up, a pair of green lights shines through his shirt.",,"Emily Mullin, Lexi Pandell, Lauren Goode, Veronique Greenwood, Will Knight, Katie Drummond, Louise Matsakis, John Semley, Molly Longman, Michael Calore","game, brain, theres, pittsburgh, company, trial, signals, target, jacksons, neuralinkand, mindreading, disease, als, jackson, surpass",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:48.760924+00:00,9078276e85a0fde06cff9f6e89ea43568e5969a94f8e820b61528800246b0b48
243,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/big-interview-bryan-johnson/,Bryan Johnson Is Going to Die,2025-07-21T10:00:00+00:00,"At first, the two bowls of fruit on Bryan Johnson’s kitchen island look perfect. They’re brimming with plump kiwis, hardy avocados, and ripened bananas. These are the food of the gods, I figure, for a man who aspires to live like one. But then I look closer. A lone orange, its skin flecked with mold, sits adjacent to two lemons, both almost entirely consumed by a layer of white fuzz. Something, it seems, is rotten in the estate of Johnson.

Beyond Wellness The line between science and wellness has been blurred beyond recognition. WIRED is here to help.

That estate, it’s worth noting, is a predictable one. Johnson’s home in Venice, California, is the angular, concrete-floored template of a dwelling you’d assume is owned by a man. Specifically a man who worked in tech, made his millions, and subsequently embarked on a midlife, post-wealth search for purpose. All of which Johnson is, and did, and still appears to be doing: After selling his web payments company, Braintree, for $800 million in 2013, Johnson parted ways with both his wife and his lifelong Mormon religion. In 2021 he announced Project Blueprint, an effort designed to reverse his own body’s aging process. This involves an all-consuming, unproven regimen including but not limited to daily exercises, blood tests, a doctrinal sleep routine, MRIs, plasma transfers, scalp stimulants, urine tests, several dozen supplements, Dexa scans, light therapy, and caloric restriction.

If the rotting fruit didn’t give it away, then no, this is not a kitchen where household memories are made over milk and cookies—although a collage of candid photos taped above Johnson’s stove offers hints of familial warmth. (Johnson has three kids, one of whom is infamous for donating data on his youthful erections and his own plasma to his father’s anti-aging efforts.) This is a kitchen, after all, that shares a home with specimen cups of semen and coolers of Johnson’s blood; where pills and powders, which I find meticulously stocked in Johnson’s walk-in pantry, are mixed, optimized, and consumed; where food is not eaten so much as nutrition is performed.

Performance, of course, is Johnson’s specialty. There’s the performance of his body, which Johnson claims is now the single healthiest on Earth. And there’s how that body shows up to the viewing public, which it does quite often. Johnson has been the subject of dozens of profiles and interviews, as well as a Netflix documentary released earlier this year. He has amassed more than 4 million followers across YouTube, Instagram, and X, and he posts an ongoing stream of content about his sleep habits (sublime), his diet (meticulous), and his erections (trigger warning). Johnson has also used his online reach to push back against recent controversies, including a legal battle with his former fiancée Taryn Southern, and a New York Times investigation into his extensive use of confidentiality agreements to prevent, among other things, Blueprint employees from publicly talking about Johnson as well as his business dealings.

Over a 90-minute conversation, Johnson spoke at length about his longevity protocol, his assessment of RFK Jr.’s MAHA movement, and those agreements that he continues to enforce. He also took great pains to convince me—and all of you—that this wasn’t just about health and longevity. No, like most tech men living in boxy modernist homes and saddled with illusions of grandeur, Johnson has a new holy grail with which to galvanize his faithful following: artificial intelligence, baby.

Last week, we looked at the largest investment rounds in fusion energy this year, and now we’re honing in on Europe’s booming defence tech arena.

Europe’s defence tech startups secured $971mn in funding in the first half of this year, as VCs look to capitalise on the continent’s push to rearm amid heightened geopolitical tensions.

Funding in H1 2025 has already shot past the whole of 2024 — the previous record year — which saw defence startups raise $605mn, according to Dealroom data. German startups led the charge, raising $881mn — 90% of Europe’s total defence tech investments.

Munich-based Helsing took the lion’s share. In June, the startup secured a whopping €600mn ($660mn) in Europe’s largest funding round of the year so far. The deal, led by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek’s VC firm Prima Materia, valued Helsing at €12bn ($13.2bn), making it one of the continent’s most valuable private companies.

Founded in 2021, Helsing develops AI software for weapons, vehicles, and military strategy. Its tech has been integrated into battlefield simulations, electronic warfare for fighter jets, and drones in Ukraine. The company also recently unveiled plans for a fleet of autonomous reconnaissance submarines to boost Europe’s maritime defences.

The year’s second biggest cash injection went to another German company — Quantum Systems, which raised €160mn ($176mn) at a valuation north of €1bn ($1.1bn).

Quantum Systems builds electric, AI-powered autonomous surveillance drones that are dual-use, meaning they can serve both military and civil purposes.

Defence forces can use the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to spy on enemies and gather intel. The drones can also be used by farmers to inspect their crops, by energy companies to check power lines, and by search and rescue teams to look for survivors.

The third biggest round also went to a German company: ARX Robotics, headquartered near Munich, which bagged €31mn ($34mn) in April to expand its fleet of autonomous land drones. The round came shortly after ARX announced plans to invest £45mn ($58mn) into a new UK factory.

ARX’s machines drive around on treads and can be fitted with equipment such as radar, mine-sweeping devices, or medical stretchers. The largest carries military payloads weighing up to 500kg — including injured soldiers — across the battlefield.

Other notable defence tech deals this year include a $20mn round for Britain’s Skyral — a startup founded by former Prime Minister Tony Blair’s son, Nick. The company is developing military simulation tech for the British Army and NATO. Another German business also got a big funding boost: Swarm Biotactics. The startup raised €10mn ($11mn) to advance its unusual biorobotic system, which equips live cockroaches with sensors to monitor extreme environments.

The investments come amid a broader defence tech boom in Europe, with governments turning to technologies like drones, submarines, and AI-based weaponry.

Kate Leaman, chief market analyst at online broker AvaTrade, previously told TNW that military tech companies have “huge potential” for growth — particularly those with AI-driven solutions.

“We’re already seeing a shake-up in the defence sector, with AI-focused players like Palantir outperforming more traditional defence giants,” Leaman said. “This suggests that cutting-edge, tech-centric firms could possibly capture a sizeable share of the market.”",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","german, military, tech, credit, germany, record, 90, arx, defence, funding, round, snaps, europes, drones",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:08.711344+00:00,d7818ee26c0fb171cbf5b83d505e2ce7b34f4ec60edcdd91e91982d25ee4bc39

Here’s how it ranks globally,2025-07-18T13:34:39+00:00,"The UK has just launched its most advanced supercomputer — the 11th most powerful in the world.

Isambard-AI, hosted at the University of Bristol, officially went live this week. The machine was built by Hewlett-Packard Enterprises (HPE) using its Cray EX architecture and fitted with over 5400 NVIDIA Grace Hopper superchips.

Its raw computing power is measured at 216.5 petaflops, with a peak theoretical performance of 278.6 petaflops. For the uninitiated, one petaflop is equal to 1 quadrillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) calculations per second. The system is more than 10x faster than the UK’s next-fastest supercomputer — the Njoerd supercluster in London.

Funded by £225mn ($300mn) in government money, Isambard-AI is designed to run demanding artificial intelligence and scientific calculations, from modelling protein structures to simulating climate change and training large language models.

How Isambard-AI compares to the world’s most powerful supercomputers

While Isambard-AI has become the UK’s most powerful supercomputer, on the global stage, it faces stiff competition. According to the TOP500 rankings, the current world leader is El Capitan in the United States, which clocks in at a staggering 1,742 petaflops of actual performance.

Frontier and Aurora take second and third place, both American-built systems operating above the 1,000-petaflop threshold — the equivalent of one exaflop. The top three are the world’s only currently operational exascale supercomputers.

Europe’s frontrunner, Germany’s JUPITER Booster, ranks fourth globally. The continent also hosts four other machines in the top 10: Italy’s HPC6 (6th), Switzerland’s Alps (8th), Finland’s LUMI (9th), and Italy’s Leonardo (10th).

Still, Isambard-AI’s entry into the top 11 is a significant leap for the UK, whose Labour government wants to make the country a leader in AI development.

Peter Kyle, the UK’s science, innovation, and technology secretary, said the new machine would “propel” Britain to the “forefront of AI discovery.”

“Today we put the most powerful computer system in the country into the hands of British researchers and entrepreneurs,” he said.

Some of the first applications of Isambard-AI include powering a prostate cancer detection system developed by University College London and helping Liverpool researchers discover greener, more sustainable industrial materials.

But Isambard-AI’s reign at the top may be short-lived. In June, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s administration committed £750mn to a supercomputer in Edinburgh that aims to give the UK one of the world’s few exascale systems.",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","uk, petaflops, globally, isambardai, system, supercomputer, launched, worlds, week, ranks, uks, heres, ai, powerful, britain",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:04.307010+00:00,60ed81dbd9c4994a6a8e73fc9b09a0c65c90df19533cf6c129e8c62b63f7d88c

It’s the latest company heading to the far north to tap into abundant green energy and natural cooling for power-hungry data centres.

The facility will be located in the Norwegian coastal town of Narvik, which lies 220km within the Arctic Circle. Aker’s president and CEO, Øyvind Eriksen said that the site already had access to 230MW of power and was ready for construction to commence. He added that discussions with potential tech firms and partners for the project were ongoing.

However, Eriksen provided limited details on the facility’s purpose, stating it will “serve as a catalyst for industrial development, job creation, and export revenues.”

“AI and data centres are becoming foundational to global business, and northern Norway is uniquely positioned to benefit,” said Eriksen. “The region offers abundant, affordable hydropower and clean energy, along with the conditions needed to attract investment and foster innovation.”

Aker, which is majority-owned by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Rokke, has a number of AI and software investments under its belt, including in Bitcoin investment firm Seetee and industrial data company Cognite. Eriksen said the AI facility in Narvik would represent an opportunity to “enter a new value chain early.”

Bits meet blizzards

The Nordic region is fast becoming a global hotspot for AI data infrastructure. Last year, Google committed another €1bn to its Hamina campus in southern Finland, marking its seventh expansion. The data centre upgrade aims to support surging demand for AI compute while tapping into the region’s large supplies of renewable energy.

Not far away, Amsterdam-based Nebius announced in October that it’s tripling GPU capacity at its Mäntsälä site in Sweden, where it aims to run 60,000 GPUs for AI applications.

Also in Sweden, Microsoft bet $3.2bn (€2.7bn) to boost its cloud and AI capacity across its three data centres in the country last year. The tech giant is also reportedly developing a dozen new sites in Finland under its “power-first” strategy, aimed at meeting massive AI compute demands while pushing toward its carbon-negative goals.

Big Tech aside, the Nordics are also sprouting their own homegrown AI players, including the likes of Finland’s Silo AI, which was bought by chipmaker AMD in a $665mn (571mn) deal in October.

What did WeTransfer change?

WeTransfer users discovered this week that the service had updated its policy with a clause granting it a perpetual, royalty‑free license to use user‑uploaded content, including for “improving machine learning models that enhance content moderation.” The changes were due to come into effect on August 8.

That language was vague enough that many users — including children’s book writer Sarah McIntyre and comedian Matt Lieb — felt it opened the door for WeTransfer to use or even sell their files to train AI without permission or compensation.

How did WeTransfer respond?

On Tuesday afternoon, WeTransfer scrambled to douse the flames, saying in a press release that it doesn’t use user content to train AI, nor does it sell or share files with third parties. The company says it considered using AI to “improve content moderation” in the future, but that such a feature “hasn’t been built or deployed in practice.”

WeTransfer has also now amended its terms of service, removing any mentions of machine learning. The updated version states that users grant the company “a royalty-free license” to use their content for “operating, developing, and improving the service.”

But the damage to user trust may already be done.

Why are users so concerned?

WeChat joins a growing list of companies that have attracted criticism for training machine learning systems on user data. Adobe, Zoom, Slack, Dropbox, and others have also recently walked back or clarified similar AI-related policies after public outcry. All these incidents tap into wider frustrations around copyright and consent in the AI age — and point to trust issues between users and tech firms.

WeTransfer has long marketed itself as a creative-friendly, privacy-conscious file-sharing service. So it’s perhaps unsurprising that the vague wording around AI and sweeping license rights felt like a betrayal to its users, particularly for artists and freelancers worried their work could be quietly fed into machine learning models without consent.

While WeTransder did clarify its terms, for many users of the service, the damage was already done. In replies to WeTransfer’s official announcement on X, some said that it looked like the service had tested the waters with broader AI permissions, got swift public backlash, and then quickly walked it back.

WeTransfer is unlikely to be the last tech firm caught up in this kind of controversy. As AI fever spreads, user data is becoming the new fuel.",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","reignited, train, tech, fears, content, data, service, users, wetransfer, machine, user, training, ai, learning",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:18.110674+00:00,be2f704b097ffaed94c6a5d94807fe729f0f570a1605564bfb0eb143036ed68a

It plans to do this with what it calls a “God Mode” view of the internet.

At the heart of Whisper’s approach is a massive, real-time map of global internet infrastructure. The map is built from more than 45 billion data points sourced from 18 different systems, such as domain name registries (DNS), IP address databases, routing protocols (BGP), and ownership records (Whois).

Using knowledge graph technology to organise this information, the map updates in sub-seconds. Whisper’s CEO Leonardo Carlo Calisse said it allows cybersecurity teams to enter the aforementioned “God Mode,” a term borrowed from gaming, where it denotes invincibility and total control.

“‘God Mode’ refers to Whisper’s advanced cybersecurity visibility, an unprecedented, real-time view of the entire internet’s infrastructure,” Calisse told TNW. “It enables organisations to detect and track cyber threats by exposing attacker infrastructure and hidden relationships before any damage occurs.”

Whisper’s platform returns real-time threat scores and metadata on anything from a suspicious domain to a shadowy network cluster. It’s also been designed to minimise false alarms, using what the company describes as entropy-based scoring to help security teams save time.

The cyber threat landscape

Whisper arrives in challenging times for online security. Cyber attacks are becoming harder to detect as threat actors deploy increasingly sophisticated methods. These include so-called multi-vector attacks — coordinated campaigns that target different parts of a system simultaneously. Artificial intelligence is also increasingly used to automate and disguise malicious activity online.

As these tactics evolve, the overall scale of cybercrime is increasing rapidly, having surged over 300% since 2015. McKinsey estimates global cybersecurity-related losses could hit $10.5 trillion (€9 trillion) annually by the end of 2025.

Calisse said he believes the surge in the amount and type of online crime demands an “entirely new generation” of cybersecurity tools.

Since launching in January, Whisper has already secured pilot projects with other cybersecurity providers. The startup now plans to scale following a €1.6mn pre-seed round, led by Atlas AI^VB Fund I, with participation from Antler, D11Z, Tioga Trust, and Volve Capital.",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","realtime, whispers, stealth, cybersecurity, cyber, detect, tackle, whisper, cybercrime, threat, map, infrastructure, mode, emerges, online, god",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:19.912933+00:00,7edfa4c86eb727c8f690521174639a948fe4e3229195a6ed887f53877bcf7e99

Last week, we looked at the largest investment rounds in the Netherlands, and now we’re honing in on Europe’s budding fusion energy sector.

European fusion energy startups raised a record €290mn in the first half of this year as VCs bet big on a technology with the potential to supply virtually limitless clean power.

Funding in 2025 has already eclipsed 2024 levels — the previous record year — which saw fusion energy companies raise €185mn, according to Dealroom data.

Leading the pack this year was Munich-based Proxima Fusion. The company secured €130mn in Series A funding in June from big-name investors including Balderton Capital, Cherry Ventures, and Plural. The round marked Europe’s largest single investment in a fusion energy startup.

Proxima, which was spun out of the prestigious Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in 2023, aims to commercialise a type of fusion machine known as a stellarator. Shaped like a twisted metal doughnut, the stellarator is far more complex to design than the more common tokamak — but if engineered correctly, it could provide a more stable and continuous source of fusion power.

The year’s second biggest cash injection went to another Munich-based company: Marvel Fusion. The company raised €113mn in a Series B funding round in March led by investors including EQT and Siemens Energy.

Marvel is developing a type of laser-based fusion called inertial confinement. Instead of using big magnets or giant reactors like other fusion approaches, the method fires ultra-powerful lasers at tiny fuel pellets made of hydrogen. The lasers create extreme heat and pressure, causing the hydrogen atoms to fuse together and release energy — similar to how the sun works, but in short, controlled bursts. Last year, Marvel broke ground on a $150mn laser facility in Colorado.

Other significant funding rounds in Europe’s budding fusion energy sector this year went to France’s Renaissance Fusion, which raised €32mn for its stellarator design, and Sweden’s Novatron, which secured €10mn to build a unique type of fusion reactor it described to TNW as a “mirror machine.”

The record funding comes as Europe races to take the lead in the race to launch the first commercially viable fusion reactor, which the majority of industry experts believe will come online sometime in the 2030s.

Francesco Sciortino, co-founder and CEO of Proxima, believes fusion energy can complement wind and solar power and become a “decisive building block” for Europe’s energy security.

“Fusion holds the potential to fundamentally transform the way we think about energy, changing the world from a place that’s controlled by those with reserves of oil and gas, to one where technology lets countries control their own fate,” he previously told TNW.

Sciortino believes Europe has the potential to lead in the technology. However, funding for fusion on the continent still pales in comparison to the US.

In the first half of this year, US-based fusion startups secured a combined $1.6bn (€1.3bn) in investment, over four times more than their European counterparts. Major rounds include a whopping $1bn Series B for Bill Gates-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems and a $425mn investment into Helion Energy, which has won support from Sam Altman.",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","proxima, startups, fusion, european, push, energy, series, technology, investment, funding, type, records, stellarator, europes, shatter, clean",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:10.045354+00:00,347485404147771898b0cd69fa30d421a5532523f6f54f7abf3041b35451289c

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

Bluesky is adding age verification to its platform in the UK as part of efforts to comply with the country’s Online Safety Act. In an update on Thursday, the platform says it will let users verify their age by scanning their face, uploading an ID, or entering a payment card.

Bluesky will perform age verification through Kid Web Services (KWS), an Epic Games-owned tool that developers can use to implement age verification and parental controls on their platforms. If users don’t want to verify their age, or if they’re under 18, they will still be able to have an account with certain features limited. Bluesky will block “adult-appropriate content” and turn off certain features, such as direct messaging.

The UK passed the Online Safety Act in 2023, which privacy advocates have warned will “lead to a much more censored, locked-down internet for British users.” Another part of the law is coming into force on July 25th, requiring sites and apps containing porn and harmful content to provide “highly effective age assurance.” Platforms that don’t comply with the new rules will face fines of up to £18 million ($24 million) or 10 percent of their worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.

Once the age requirements take effect, Bluesky says it will show a notification to users in the UK asking them to verify their age. Based on the images shared by Bluesky, it looks like UK users will first have to register their email with KWS, which will send them instructions on how to verify their age. “In addition to these updates, we’ll continue to look at how we’re doing to shield children from unwanted content, and how we can improve,” Bluesky writes in the update.",,Emma Roth,"uk, rolling, bluesky, safety, age, content, verification, verify, users, writer, update",pending,2025-08-15T23:52:39.073849+00:00,93897891ddf25d4009ac39df348677e50b32ccc2aa1a712ea12245ef717cfd3d

The investment, first reported by Reuters, follows the lead of the French state, which is set to inject €717mn into Eutelsat as part of a €1.35bn funding package to prop up the indebted satellite communications provider. The UK contribution would bring Eutelsat’s recapitalisation to around €1.5bn.

French President Emmanuel Macron thanked his “British friends” for the support in a post on X, without disclosing the deal’s value.

Eutelsat has received significant attention this year, as European leaders scramble to reduce their reliance on Starlink, especially in Ukraine, which has become highly dependent on the service in its war with Russia.

The French firm operates the third-largest satellite communications fleet — 653 satellites orbiting the Earth, each circling about 1,200km above the surface. The company previously told TNW that, in Europe, it offers the same coverage and latency capabilities as Starlink.

In June, French Finance Minister Eric Lombard described his country’s investment as part of its broader ambitions to build a competitive, resilient, and sovereign space industry.

“This transaction reflects our strong commitment towards a major player in satellite connectivity — a strategic sector at the heart of Europe’s digital sovereignty,” he said.

The funding offers a much-needed lifeline for Eutelsat, which had a net debt of €2.6bn at the end of 2024, according to its own financial reporting. It could also help the company contribute to the deployment of IRIS2, a European public-private satellite internet constellation expected to switch on in 2030.

IRIS2 is a European attempt to create a truly sovereign satellite communications system. The constellation will build upon Eutelsat’s existing fleet and that of SES, a satellite firm from Luxembourg.

Lombard said the IRIS2 project would be a “key pillar” of Europe’s autonomy in space.

The company will work with Fugro, a provider of offshore surveying and geodata services, and DTACT, a defence-focused cybersecurity firm, to offer governments a new tool for monitoring critical underwater infrastructure, including gas pipelines and subsea cables.

The platform aims to fuse real-time data from sea, air, and space to create a dynamic picture of maritime activity. Fugro’s drones, underwater vehicles, and uncrewed surface vessels will sweep the oceans for geodata. Overhead, Ubotica’s AI-powered satellites will track vessels and flag anomalies in near-real time. On the ground, DTACT will pull these streams together into a maritime cybersecurity tool.

Fintan Buckley, CEO of Ubotica, said this “space-to-seabed surveillance” could transform situational awareness at sea.

“This integrated approach, bringing together our insights with Fugro and DTACT, creates enhanced maritime awareness and a near real-time response capability that will secure critical underwater infrastructure well into the future,” he said.

Maritime surveillance of this kind has become increasingly in demand since the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage, which exposed the vulnerability of underwater assets to covert attacks. European nations in NATO are also stepping up their defences at sea amid growing concerns over Russian aggression.

Ivar de Josselin de Jong, director of strategy and government relations for Fugro’s maritime security and surveillance business, said the new partnership would enable “information-driven operations” for national security efforts.

The platform will initially focus on serving governmental organisations in the North Sea and Baltic regions, which have become a testing ground for European maritime defence tech due to their strategic importance and relative proximity to Russia.

In fact, it should be a priority to stick one onto the console’s screen as soon as possible to avoid accidental scratches.

I’ve been installing and removing Switch 2 screen protectors to test others on my console at an alarming rate, more than any sane person should, and here are the most important takeaways:

Some protectors are glossy and some are anti-reflective, each with its own tradeoffs. For my money, glossy is the way to go. The matte finish looks good, but it reduces the screen’s vivid quality and its viewing angles.

It’s impossible to tell different brands’ protectors apart once they’re on your screen; product packaging and the installation process are the biggest differences (as well as the key factors that increase cost).

The Tineco Pure One Station 5 is setting a new benchmark for cordless vacuum design, combining innovative technology, self-maintenance features, and powerful performance into a sleek system. Built for busy lives and modern homes, it’s more than just a vacuum. It’s a smarter way to clean.

For years, legacy brands like Dyson have dominated the cordless vacuum space. But with the introduction of the Pure One Station 5, Tineco isn’t just keeping up, it’s pushing the category forward in ways that directly address what today’s consumers want most: less hassle, more automation, and a deeper clean.

Here’s how the Pure One Station 5 compares to the Dyson V11 and why it could be the better pick for your home.

Hassle Free Cleaning Experience

The Dyson V11 has a reputation for strong performance, but with that comes a fair amount of manual work. You need to empty the bin yourself, rinse the filters, and regularly untangle hair from the brush roll. For households that use their vacuums frequently, the upkeep can become tedious quickly.

The Tineco Pure One Station 5 was built with all of that in mind. Its all-in-one base does more than charge the vacuum. It automatically empties the dustbin into a larger 2.5L eco container, so you can go longer between manual disposals. It also washes the filter and cleans the brush roll independently, reducing the need for regular maintenance. When you’re done vacuuming, just dock it. The system resets itself and is ready to go the next time you need it.

This may seem like a minor perk at first, but for anyone used to dealing with messy post-cleaning maintenance, it’s a major upgrade. It also makes the Tineco Pure One Station 5 ideal for anyone who wants the benefits of a powerful cordless vacuum without the hassle.

Smarter Tech, Less Guesswork

The V11 features a small LCD screen that displays battery life and allows you to manually switch between power modes. It’s helpful, but it still leaves most of the thinking up to you.

Tineco steps in with a smarter system. The iLoop Smart Sensor technology continuously monitors dirt levels in real-time and adjusts suction accordingly. That means it automatically uses more power when cleaning up large messes and reduces power consumption to save battery when things are lighter.

You also get app connectivity, which provides a dashboard of cleaning data, system alerts, and performance tips. It’s not just a gimmick; it provides users with more visibility into how their vacuum is performing and when maintenance is needed, eliminating the need for guesswork.

While you’re still the one doing the vacuuming, Tineco’s innovative features act like a helpful co-pilot by automatically adjusting suction, monitoring filter health, and tracking usage, so you don’t have to. It’s a hands-on tool, but with fewer decisions and fewer surprises.

Performance That Holds Up

Both vacuums are strong performers across different floor types, including hardwood, tile, and carpet. Dyson has a legacy of impressive suction power, and the V11 continues to uphold this standard.

The Tineco Pure One Station 5 matches that performance while offering more control and efficiency. Because of its real-time suction adjustments, it often ends up cleaning more effectively without draining the battery as quickly.

The Pure One Station 5 also features ZeroTangle technology, which significantly reduces hair wrap. For pet owners or anyone with long hair, this is a real time-saver.

Power That Goes the Distance

Tineco’s Pure One Station 5 offers up to 70 minutes of runtime, giving it a clear edge over the Dyson V11, which maxes out at 60 minutes. In real-world use, that difference can be significant, especially in larger homes or during more thorough cleans.

And thanks to its smart iLoop sensor that automatically adjusts suction based on how dirty the surface is, the Pure One Station 5 uses power more efficiently. That means you get a longer clean on a single charge without wasting battery where it’s not needed.

Thoughtful Design Details

Tineco’s full-path self-cleaning design goes beyond convenience. By keeping the filter, brush, and dustbin clean automatically, it helps reduce wear and tear, which in turn extends the overall performance and longevity of the vacuum.

There are also thoughtful touches that demonstrate Tineco’s understanding of how people actually use these devices. A green LED headlight on the cleaning head helps illuminate dust and debris on hard-to-see surfaces, which is a feature not found on the Dyson V11. And instead of requiring you to hold down a trigger the entire time you vacuum, the Pure One Station 5 uses a single-button control, making longer cleaning sessions more comfortable.

Small upgrades like these add up, especially when the goal is to make cleaning feel less like a chore and more like something your tech is handling for you.

The Verdict

The Dyson V11 remains a strong cordless vacuum, particularly for those loyal to the brand or those who prioritize suction power. But for anyone looking for something smarter, cleaner, and easier to live with, the Tineco Pure One Station 5 feels like a clear evolution of the category.

It’s not just about cleaning your floors. It’s about rethinking how a vacuum fits into your home and your routine. Tineco manages to achieve this while offering a lower price. The Pure One Station 5 retails for around $459, while the Dyson V11 sells for $569.99.

For less money, Tineco offers hands-free maintenance, smart suction adjustment, a more ergonomic control system, and built-in tech that simplifies upkeep. It’s a value proposition that’s hard to ignore, and one that suggests the future of cordless vacuums may already be here.

Modern boards know what leverage looks like. In fast-moving, high-stakes environments, every meeting has to deliver clarity, context, and momentum. But across sectors — from startups to universities to health systems — most boards are still stuck in outdated workflows.

According to our internal research, 62% of boards still use email and PDFs to prepare and distribute materials. That isn’t just inefficient; it places a heavy tax on the executive teams who must compile and manage these materials manually. It slows decision-making, weakens alignment, and undermines strategic focus.

The promise of good governance has always been aspirational, something boards strive for but rarely fully achieve. The tools of yesterday — PDF board books, chain emails, and disconnected platforms — weren’t built for the complexity or pace of today’s leadership landscape. AI is changing that in tangible, immediate ways, helping directors focus on what matters most: leading with clarity, governing with confidence, and acting with precision.

We’re at a turning point. Boards that adopt secure AI to streamline how they prepare, meet, and follow through will gain more than efficiency. They’ll lead. They’ll attract top-tier directors, move faster than the market, and deliver greater strategic impact. This isn’t a tech transition. It’s a shift in how leadership gets done, and it’s already happening.

AI for the Fortune 5 Million

At OnBoard, we consider ourselves fortunate to serve mission-driven organizations whose board decisions shape lives every day, from nonprofits tackling urgent local and global challenges, to credit unions funding small business dreams, to health care systems working to cure diseases and improve community wellness, to universities preparing the next generation of leaders. Their impact is real, and we’re proud to support the governance that makes it possible.

That work is becoming more complex every day. Across every sector, boards are grappling with shifting environments that require smarter, faster, and more secure decision-making. In higher education, evolving DEI regulations and institutional oversight mandates are reshaping board responsibilities. Nonprofits must navigate unpredictable funding and rising demand for transparency. Trade and professional associations are adjusting to fluid international policy shifts. Health care systems manage a web of compliance obligations and performance expectations. Financial institutions face intensifying pressure regarding cybersecurity, digital innovation, and ESG accountability.

Yet amid these changes, one thing remains constant: the importance of strong governance. In every sector, boards need tools that support agility, insight, and trust.

Often, when people imagine boardrooms, they think of corporate giants like Apple, Amazon, or Exxon; enterprises with enormous revenue streams and global influence. But those are exceptions. Most board-led organizations operate with leaner teams, smaller budgets, and limited access to specialized advisory services. These are the organizations we serve – the “Fortune 5 million” – where governance is essential, but resources are finite.

AI can and should be a great equalizer. It brings advanced, decision-supporting tools to the boards that need them most. But to deliver real value, AI has to be purpose-built. It has to speak the language of governance.

Intelligence That Supports, Not Replaces

There’s plenty of anxiety about AI automating people out of the picture. But in the boardroom, the stakes are different. Judgment matters more than ever, and AI’s role is to elevate it, not override it.

Picture a board chair skimming through a dense agenda at 11 p.m., or a director prepping for a high-stakes vote between meetings. These people don’t need more noise. They need fast, relevant signal. That’s where AI can help. It can surface what’s worth discussing, connect current topics to past decisions, and flag blind spots that might otherwise go unaddressed.

Most board software still feels like 2012 dressed up as 2025. That’s not good enough. We’re building something different, with tools designed for how boards actually work.

The AI capabilities we’re developing with OnBoard AI deliver personalized context and summaries that link to an organization’s institutional memory. It answers natural language questions like, “When did we last review our audit plan?” or, “What risks haven’t come up this year?” Not just with documents, but with meaningful insight.

These tools reduce friction, not responsibility. They give directors back precious time, so they can spend less of it hunting for answers and more of it asking sharper questions, surfacing overlooked issues, and making better decisions.

Built for Governance, Not Retrofits

Imagine this: A board meets for its monthly check-in. The first draft of the agenda is generated automatically, reflecting recent decisions, open priorities, and inputs flagged by the leadership team. It’s not automation for automation’s sake. It’s a starting point that gives board chairs or executive leaders something they can review, refine, and build on strategically. No buried email threads. No scrambling to remember what was said last time. One director asks, “Are we putting enough time into what’s actually driving growth?” The answer is right there, pulled from trends across past meetings.



As the discussion unfolds, the right context shows up when it’s needed. Meeting minutes are drafted automatically by AI within the system, accurate from the start, and easy to refine. Directors aren’t stuck reconstructing what happened from memory or chasing down loose notes. A risk item that’s been quietly resurfacing appears again, flagged automatically. Before the meeting wraps up, follow-ups are already captured and assigned.

AI can streamline critical board meeting tasks like minute-taking—boosting efficiency without compromising accuracy or confidentiality.

This is what it looks like when AI is built for boards, not bolted onto something else. We’re not retrofitting generic tools. We’re building for how boards actually operate, what directors care about, and what gets lost between meetings.

With OnBoard AI, the goal isn’t more dashboards. It’s better conversations. Clearer signals. Stronger decisions — and the peace of mind that comes from knowing nothing important is slipping through the cracks.

The Case for Security and Control

Boards deal with some of the most sensitive, high-stakes information in any organization. OnBoard AI never uses existing board archive content, user prompts, or any other data to train models or influence future outputs. Your data never leaves your unique OnBoard instance, ensuring it stays private, protected, and entirely within your board’s control.

Every aspect of OnBoard AI is designed with privacy and compliance in mind. All information stays within a closed-loop environment. The platform complies with the highest standards, including SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001/27701, HIPAA, and GDPR.

Security isn’t a feature. It’s foundational, especially in the context of compliance and control, where board decisions demand the highest levels of data protection and trust. Without trust, governance collapses.

AI as a Strategic Edge

Most people in tech saw this coming. The potential of AI has been clear for years. What few fully anticipated was how quickly it would move from lab experiments to everyday workflows once it became widely accessible to the general public, only about two years ago. Since then, it has touched nearly every type of user, application, and industry – including the boardroom.

AI is no longer a side topic or a distant horizon. It’s becoming central to how decisions get made, how directors prepare, and how boards operate with insight instead of inertia. It enables what many are beginning to call real-time board leadership. Directors are no longer limited to quarterly reactions. They can engage continuously, lead with sharper context, and move from oversight to foresight.

The specifics of how AI will evolve in governance are still unfolding. But one thing is clear. Boards that continue to rely on PDFs and email chains won’t just fall behind. They’ll struggle to meet the expectations of transparency, strategic alignment, and risk management in a world that moves faster every day.

Boards that lean in now aren’t waiting for someone else to define what AI in governance looks like. They’re shaping it. They’re setting the pace.

Some have called this the largest technological wave in human history. Whether or not that’s true, the momentum is real. Boards that embrace it today will be better positioned to lead with confidence, govern with clarity, and act with precision.

This is more than a technological shift. It’s a leadership imperative.

What’s Next for Boardroom AI

AI is already transforming boardrooms, and we’re just getting started. At OnBoard, we’re developing capabilities like predictive insights and personalized context that help directors anticipate trends, surface risks, and coach themselves in real time.

We’re also expanding OnBoard AI to connect governance more directly with strategic execution. That means deepening institutional memory, streamlining follow-through, and raising the level of participation around the table.

Boards deserve better tools, and AI finally makes them possible. This isn’t about adding more layers of technology to already-complex processes. It’s about giving board members what they need to lead with clarity, prepare with confidence, and act with purpose.

The future of governance won’t be built by accident. It’ll be shaped by those who step forward now, with intention. We’d be proud to help lead that work.

If you’re building a company or an organization that moves fast and thinks long-term, your board should be just as agile.

This new intelligence gives giants start-up speed,2025-06-23T06:38:34,"Start-ups aiming to disrupt industry giants are facing a new obstacle: incumbents that understand their code as deeply as nimble challengers.

Historically, big companies have been weighed down by decades of accumulated code. Fixing a problem or rolling out a new feature couldn’t be done without months of manual code discovery. Wrong turns and dead ends in software development were just accepted as the cost of doing business, even as the business lost market share to new entrants.

But now, the emergence of “Software Intelligence” (SI) technology is turning big company’s labyrinths of black boxes crystal clear, enabling CIOs, architects, and developers to cut those months of work to minutes.

Like military intelligence surveying a battlefield, Software Intelligence approaches code as territory to be mapped and navigated. Scanning the source code of one application — or even thousands across an IT portfolio — SI generates 3D maps and dashboards in seconds, revealing the facts on the digital ground.

That on-premise code that won’t work in the cloud? It’s pinpointed, along with the route around it. A mountain of technical debt you can’t climb? Broken down by the number of hours to fix each flaw and ranked by ‘bang for the buck’. A new security crack opening in the open-source code? It’s automatically surfaced without having to distract busy developers.

The impact is profound.

“Imagine you’re captaining a ship in the year 1500,” says Greg Rivera, product manager at CAST, a software mapping and intelligence company. “You don’t know what’s on the other side of the ocean you’re trying to cross. You may not even know if you’re sailing in circles. One day, you’re handed satellite photos, step-by-step routes, and a GPS showing you where you are. That’s the level of change happening in IT.”

And since companies live and die by how fast their IT can move, SI is becoming a CEO imperative and a boardroom topic. “When you can finally see the pathway, you can finally run down it,” says Rivera.

Software Intelligence’s insights are instant, but getting to this point has taken more than 25 years of collecting data on how companies build, rebuild, and change their software. CAST has analyzed over a hundred billion lines of code to uncover more than 50,000 repeated patterns.

AI Enters the Chat

Humans are the first consumers of Software Intelligence, but they’re not the only ones hungry for insights. Right now, CIOs use SI to gain control over their sprawling portfolios, reduce risks, and make fact-based decisions – for instance, when prioritizing which applications to modernize. Architects meanwhile use SI to navigate inside individual applications to avoid wrong turns during modernization.

But AI wants to know these things too. Why? Because while AI is great at writing new code, it can’t modernize an existing codebase until it first knows how it’s constructed. All its elements, interactions, and dependencies across applications must be mapped. Since 80% of developer work takes place on existing code, connecting SI’s insights to AI’s abilities has become an industry necessity.

Applying this approach, insurance and risk management giant Marsh McLennan prompted their AI with insights extracted from SI’s examination of their code. The idea was to see if a giant codebase could then be modernized at AI-speed.

It could.

“CAST went line-by-line across the technology stack of several of our applications, distilling their objects and dependencies,” said Paul Beswick, Global CIO and COO at Marsh McLennan. “This information was then used by the AI to fix issues and reduce the technical debt in the software. Hundreds of objects requiring coding changes were remediated, and a process that could have taken a few months was cut to a few minutes.”

Giants aren’t the only ones moving faster. Start-ups can benefit from this too. “Vibe-coding is making it easier than ever for a company to advance from zero to one,” says Rivera. “But the codebase that gets you to ‘one’ is built with speed in mind, resulting in a lot of tech debt. Most of that needs to be rearchitected for a company to reach the next level: scale.”

Vibe coders are going to need their own map, too — to take on Goliath.

In today’s hyperconnected and competitive world, brands that excel in conversational customer experiences (CX) – real-time two-way interactions with consumers on their favourite digital channels – aren’t just ahead. They are winning.

These companies drive higher customer satisfaction, deepen loyalty and unlock efficiencies. In short, they dominate the competition.

Conversational CX maturity fuels growth. Consistent, personalised, and seamless CX builds trust and emotional connections that convert long-term value.

But there’s a catch. Reaching conversational maturity is hard. In a digital-first, AI-powered landscape, businesses that lag behind risk losing relevance.

At Infobip, CX maturity is the next frontier of digital transformation, but most brands are still on the starting line.

Are you leading, lagging – or stuck in neutral?

To thrive, businesses must benchmark their conversational maturity. What channels are in play? How integrated and intelligent is your tech stack? Most importantly, how do you move from reactive to proactive digital engagement?

Conversational CX maturity is no longer a nice-to-have. It’s a strategic imperative. It means mastering the design, implementation, and optimisation of customer interactions that feel natural, helpful, and human.

Infobip’s Conversational CX Maturity Index reveals benchmarks across four high-impact sectors: telco, retail and e-commerce, finance, and healthcare.

And most brands are not as mature as they think. While 90% of brands claim to be omnichannel, only 33% deliver seamless, synchronised experiences. The rest? They’re stuck in the multichannel trap.

That’s a big gap, but also a big opportunity.

What’s worse? More than half (51%) of firms rely on basic chatbots. Meanwhile, advanced GenAI-powered chatbots with multilingual NLP and real-time analytics are already reshaping customer expectations with real-time, personalised support.

Businesses and brands must examine the range and effectiveness of their communication channels and the sophistication of integrated tools and technologies to assess conversational maturity.

CX maturity is not about following technology trends or jumping on new fads.

Companies excelling in this area exceed customer expectations, foster loyalty and trust, and increase sales.

CX leaders commit to AI adoption.

While nine out of 10 companies are dabbling in GenAI, only one or two are effectively using Conversational AI. This is another missed opportunity.

Most brands stop at this surface-level use.

The message is clear. If brands are not pushing conversational CX maturity, they are falling behind.

We have now helped more than 6,000 businesses better understand their CX maturity.

From major European retailers to banks in the middle east, our customers have used our index to understand how mature their customer CX is and how to enhance their customer journey and boost satisfaction.

From CX Maturity to Digital Transformation

Knowing your CX Maturity is just the start. The fundamental transformation starts with action, and that’s where Infobip’s Navigator comes in.

Too many brands get stuck after the diagnosis. Many know the opportunity is there — but not how to seize it.

Infobip Navigator tackles this.

It’s not just a toolkit; it’s a full-scale CX transformation engine that can move quickly from insight to impact. It provides clarity and direction to enable the customer journeys of tomorrow.

Our Navigator empowers customer-facing teams to identify opportunities, tailor solutions, and accelerate deals across every customer journey stage.

Whether a telco wants to unify touchpoints, or a bank wants to personalise every digital interaction, Navigator gives teams the tools to act precisely and quickly.

Here’s how it works:

• Maturity Navigator diagnoses a brand’s CX maturity today.

• Vision Navigator aligns CX solutions with strategic goals.

• Value Navigator defines next steps to become more CX mature.

• Success Navigator nurtures the solution and identifies new opportunities.

Why does this matter?

Because most brands stumble at the first hurdle, they assess, talk, and then stall.

Infobip Navigator breaks this cycle.

It transforms conversations into momentum, giving our teams and customers the structure, insight, and confidence to execute.

Infobip Navigator is not just theory.

It’s already working, with banks in APAC, telcos across EMEA, and retailers worldwide.

We’re helping brands understand their current state and move up the maturity curve with a clear, pragmatic plan.

No more guesswork. No more delays. Just strategic acceleration, powered by Infobip’s Navigator.

A roadmap to raise your CX maturity and unlock measurable results

There are a few key steps for businesses and brands wanting to transform their customer experiences, embrace digital interactions, and enhance their conversational maturity.

First, assess your current maturity. Identify where you are and where you want to be.

Second, invest in AI-powered automation. GenAI is just the beginning. Next, agentic AI can handle routine queries and free up agents for high-value interactions.

Third, double down on personalisation. Use data to deliver tailored conversational experiences.

Fourth, transform at your pace, but don’t wait. A phased rollout doesn’t mean a slow one. Agile implementation is the name of the game.

Fifth, lock down your data. Trust is built on security. Make it a core part of your CX design.

It’s time to lead

When consumers expect more seamless and conversational experiences across every touch point, anything less is a risk.

Whether for marketing, sales, or support, everything is a conversation.

The only question left. Are you ready to discover where you stand?

348,thenextweb.com,https://thenextweb.com/news/space-startups-defence-tech-pivot,Opinion: Space startups are pivoting to defence. That’s great for innovation,2025-06-13T06:00:27+00:00,"A few months ago, at the SmallSat Symposium, a panel issued a sobering warning to space startups: do not chase defence dollars at the expense of long-term sustainability. Why? Because companies, particularly in the space sector, might be tempted to follow the money rather than focus on producing valuable products and services with broader, longer-term applications. It’s of course true that any company should be wary of “leaning in” too closely to what seem like passing fads. But the warning overlooks an important reality: the shift towards defence investing is not a trend. It’s a transformation in space and space investment, and one that will have positive — albeit unintended — consequences.

Across the space sector, there has been a noticeable shift towards focusing on pure defence investing. Companies that once prioritised commercial applications, or at most maintained dual-use business models, are now making full-scale pivots to defence. Needless to say, that move isn’t random. It’s the product of geopolitical changes, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and a widespread belief that the world is changing. As Michael Gove, who served in the Cabinets of four British prime ministers, put it recently: “The ideal of a rules-based international order, where multilateral institutions restrain states pursuing their self-interest, has proved to be a false hope… we are back to a world closer to that of Thucydides in which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”

The change is happening at the public sector level, too. In 2024, global governmental expenditure on space programmes surged to $135 billion (€119 billion) — up 10% from the year before. The primary driver was rising defence budgets. A recent Bruegel report concluded that without support from the United States, “Europe could need 300,000 more troops and an annual defence spending hike of at least €250 billion” to keep the continent safe. As geopolitical tensions rise, governments worldwide have been funnelling money into space-based defence technology, a recognition that the sector is the cornerstone of any modern military.

One of the unintended yet highly beneficial consequences of this shift among startups is its impact on the private space sector. Increased defence investment is breathing new life into aerospace and deep-tech innovation. Companies that previously struggled to secure commercial funding are now benefiting from sustained government investment, allowing them to work on cutting-edge technologies. These include (among many others) optical communications, needed for secure and high-speed space-based data transmission; Earth observation, crucial for climate monitoring, disaster response, and resource management; and synthetic aperture radar (SAR), enabling all-weather, day-and-night imaging capabilities with high precision.

Despite the opportunities that await here, moving from purely commercial to defence markets is not without its hurdles. Startups can face significant challenges. Government contracts often come with delayed payments and long procurement cycles, creating cashflow issues for smaller firms that lack financial reserves. Defence-related technologies are subject to stringent export controls and compliance requirements, heaping bureaucratic burdens on startups that many are ill-equipped to bear.

But for those companies that make the pivot successfully, the rewards far outweigh these obstacles. Defence funding provides long-term stability and a runway for companies to develop world-class technology that may later be commercialised in other sectors. In other words, to pivot into space isn’t necessarily to leave behind the commercial world.

Some startups are making full-blown pivots to defence, but the real sweet spot remains in the world of dual-use technology — those innovations that serve both commercial and defence markets. Companies that maintain this balance benefit from diverse revenue streams, greater resilience to market fluctuations, and the ability to shift emphasis as commercial demand evolves.

The success of this dual-use approach is plain to see in the companies that have seamlessly integrated their offerings across sectors. Take the SAR satellite company ICEYE, whose data is used in flood response, maritime activity monitoring, and conflict zones like Ukraine. Or FibreCoat, whose advanced materials protect satellites from the harsh conditions of space, regardless of what those satellites are used for.

Given the scale of government investment, as well as the ongoing volatility in the broader geopolitical landscape, it’s highly unlikely that the present shift in focus towards defence is merely a fad. There is a new world order in place, and national security considerations will play a defining role in geopolitics for years to come.

However, the space sector’s ultimate goal should be a balanced ecosystem where defence and commercial efforts reinforce one another. The current surge in defence spending is helping accelerate technological innovation, funding infrastructure that will benefit the commercial sector in the long run. As companies continue to develop dual-use applications, they can ensure that the innovations sparked by defence priorities also drive broader commercial progress.

That’s good news because space touches almost every area of modern life. It’s the backbone of the world economy. It plays a vital role in navigation, communication, connectivity, and sustainability. The space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion (€1.58 trillion) by 2035, according to a report by McKinsey and the World Economic Forum. We may well be entering a new golden age for the industry, one in which entrepreneurs have access to more capital, investors are more willing to back high-risk ventures, and technology development is progressing at an unprecedented pace.

If companies can navigate the challenges of defence contracting while remaining mindful of the broader commercial applications of their products, the entire space ecosystem stands to benefit. For startups, the key will be balancing short-term defence opportunities with long-term strategic growth, so ensuring that today’s pivot does not become tomorrow’s dead end. But if the evolution towards greater defence investing is managed wisely by all involved parties, it could propel the space industry into its most vibrant era yet.

Apple recently announced iOS 26, the next major software update for iPhones, and it’s packed with a whole bunch of new features. The biggest change is a new design, but there are lots of smaller improvements and additions as well that could make a difference in how you use your iPhone every day.

If you want to kick the tires before the update’s wider release this fall, you can try it now in a public beta. Here’s a bit more detail on what you can expect from iOS 26 when you install it on your device.

A refreshed design across the OS

Apple has a new design language called “Liquid Glass” that it’s being introduced across all of the company’s devices, not just the iPhone. It’s inspired by the visionOS software used with Apple’s Vision Pro headset, and it features a lot of translucency that Apple says “behaves like glass in the real world.” On-screen elements now use “real-time rendering” that lets them react to movement with highlights and color shifts.

I initially thought Liquid Glass was a wild change to my iPhone with some glaring problems, and Apple has tweaked the glassiness through the developer betas. Still, when you first boot up your phone on iOS 26 for the first time, it’s going to feel a little jarring.

Messages is getting better for group chats

In Messages, iOS 26 is adding a lot of updates that could significantly improve group chats. You’ll be able to customize the background of a chat to give it more personality. To help make group decisions or get an opinion on something, you can create polls. And, at long last, Apple is adding typing indicators to group chats, which should make them feel more lively.

Some new Phone features will help you save time

Apple is taking some cues from Google by adding a call screening feature and a “Hold Assist” feature that can wait on a call for you. The company is also adding a new unified layout option that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails all into one view.

Live Translation can translate calls in real time

Apple is adding an Apple Intelligence-powered feature that can translate text on your screen and translate speech back and forth in the middle of a phone call. The company is building the feature into Messages, FaceTime, and the Phone app, and Apple says its models for Live Translation run entirely on your device for privacy.

Some small Apple Intelligence improvements

Even though we’re still waiting for Apple to announce when it will actually release its delayed improvements to Siri, iOS 26 will include some new Apple Intelligence-powered features. Visual Intelligence will let you do searches about and take action on things you see on your screen. With Genmoji, you’ll be able to combine two emoji into one. And Shortcuts will be able to use Apple Intelligence models to improve your workflows.

The new Games app is for everything about your games

With Shortcuts, users will be able to access the AI models either on device or with Private Compute to generate responses that feed into the rest of their shortcut. For instance, a student could create a shortcut that uses AI to compare their audio transcription of their class lecture to their notes, then add key points they missed. They can also tap into ChatGPT to provide further responses that feed into their shortcut’s input.

Users will be able to tap into intelligent actions, which are a new type of shortcut that’s enabled by Apple Intelligence. For instance, there are dedicated actions like those for summarizing text with AI (Apple Intelligence’s Writing Tools) or creating images with Image Playground.

Drones now swarm where soldiers once marched, AI can detect threats faster than spies, and cyberattacks are disrupting critical infrastructure without a single shot fired. To prepare for the battles of tomorrow, NATO is turning to startups.

In June 2023, the Alliance launched DIANA, an initiative that funds and facilitates defence innovations. Across a network of over 200 accelerator sites and test centres, DIANA brings together universities, industry, and governments to work with startups on new defence capabilities.

At the helm is Jyoti Hirani-Driver. A former counter-terrorism policy advisor for the British government, Hirani-Driver was appointed DIANA COO last year. Her mission: to find dual-use technology that can serve both soldiers and civilians in the 32 NATO member nations — and get it into the field before NATO’s adversaries do.

“It’s the first time ever we’re working as one on defence innovation,” she tells TNW.

“We’ve always needed cutting-edge tech and innovation. We need it to outpace our adversaries and to make sure our armed forces have the best warfighting capabilities. DIANA can help us do that.”

At TNW Conference on June 19, Hirani-Driver will share her views on the rise of defence tech during a panel discussion between four of Europe’s leaders in the sector. Ahead of the session, she outlined the goals of DIANA — and the value of dual-use tech.

The defence tech path to market

Delivering new innovations to the armed forces can be a tricky task. The defence market has long been the domain of big contractors, complex integration processes, and lengthy procurement cycles — which can delay the uptake of emerging technologies. It can also be challenging for startups to navigate.

Her career in government gave Hirani-Driver a deep understanding of the obstacles.

She was working in counter-terrorism during the rise of ISIS and supported British responses to terrorist attacks. Her experiences showed that national security required new approaches.

“We knew we couldn’t just keep doing the same thing,” she says. “We needed to look at innovation and engage with the tech industry.”

Hirani-Driver soon had a chance to put that into practice. In 2018, she was appointed Chief of Staff for the Ministry of Defence’s (MoD) Defence Innovation Directorate. Under her leadership, the unit secured £1.1bn (€1.3bn) of tech R&D funding for the MoD. The investments backed advances in hypersonics, big data, autonomous systems, AI, and space-based technologies.

“My job there was to embed innovation into the lifeblood of defence — not just in terms of capabilities, but in our people as well,” she says.

“We need to think innovatively in everything we do. We need to become smarter at training our people, giving them the experience so they know what to expect and how to succeed on the battlefield.”

That mindset underpins DIANA’s mission to support dual-use tech. The approach expands the talent pool by attracting companies from outside the defence sector, accelerates adoption through faster-moving civilian markets, and boosts commercial viability through broader revenue streams. If startups can scale and survive in the civilian world, they’re more likely to succeed in defence.

“There are startups doing amazing things in the civilian world that don’t realise how valuable they could be to defence,” says Hirani-Driver. “We help them make that leap.”

How startups can make the leap

DIANA’s programmes call for solutions to specific defence and security challenges. The last five were Energy & Power; Data & Information Security; Sensing & Surveillance; Human Health & Performance; and Critical Infrastructure & Logistics.

Successful applicants then enter a six-month programme delivered by accelerator sites across the Alliance. They also gain access to NATO mentors, end-users, and unique test centres.

One of these test sites is CR14 in Estonia, a military-grade “multiverse of cyber ranges” comprising virtual environments for cybersecurity development. Under DIANA’s umbrella, British startup Goldilock went there to validate a physical network isolation solution that instantly disconnects and physically segments critical national infrastructure.

Hirani-Driver says the experience offered more than technical validation: “They can take that as a stamp of approval that their technology has been validated at one of the best cyber test centres in the Alliance.”

Each selected startup also receives €100,000 — but Hirani-Driver insists that cash is not the main value. “The gem in our programme is connecting those startups with end users, mentors, and test centres,” she says.

“I don’t want them to receive a bit of funding, finish the programme, and disappear from our ecosystem. Success for us means keeping those good ideas alive, helping them grow, and eventually seeing them deliver tech directly to our forces.”

A diverse array of them have already progressed through the programmes. They range from Goldilock’s cyber defence system, to Lithuanian startup Astrolight’s secure laser communication systems, and Polish tech firm Revobeam’s intelligent antennas — which are particularly suited for unmanned vehicles operating in challenging environments.

The Netherlands has also been represented. Delft-based Lobster Robotics joined DIANA last year after catching attention for its autonomous underwater vehicles for seabed mapping — a technology valuable for both marine conservation and naval surveillance.

“I want to see Lobster Robotics delivering to the Navies across the Alliance,” Hirani-Driver says.

With the next wave of DIANA challenges launching this summer, the programme is set to expand into additional focus areas. Hirani-Driver wants them to bring new innovations to NATO’s warfighting capabilities.

“Big defence contractors have an important role to play in the security of the Alliance, but we continually need new players, more choice — and better tech,” she says. “Innovations from early-stage startups and SMEs are therefore critical for the Alliance and our defence capabilities.”",,"Thomas Macaulay, Story By","outpace, tech, turning, alliance, security, startups, rivals, diana, technology, test, nato, defence, hiranidriver, innovation",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:24.222826+00:00,797a118952b9b6d0eb6ef1743d7f5e1a58b214c56c44642b08a5dd67b27e413b
350,thenextweb.com,https://thenextweb.com/news/eu-law-criminals-crypto-kidnappings-france,‘Little evidence’ that EU laws aided criminals in crypto kidnappings,2025-05-29T10:30:02+00:00,"Earlier this month, the father of a wealthy cryptocurrency entrepreneur was abducted in Paris while walking his dog. The attackers, wearing balaclavas, forced him into a van, later severing one of his fingers and sending a video of the mutilation to his son alongside a demand for millions of euros in ransom.

The incident joined a growing list of violent crimes in France linked to crypto wealth. Victims have included a prominent entrepreneur and his wife who were held hostage, a man doused in petrol, and a child targeted in an attempted abduction.

As fear spreads within France’s crypto community, some industry figures are accusing the EU’s landmark digital asset regulations of exposing holders to greater risk. Their concerns centre on the transparency requirements, which could make it easier to track down crypto owners. However, other insiders argue that the EU rules make a convenient scapegoat.

Stanislas Barthélemi, president of the French crypto lobbying group ADAN, told the New York Times this week that the rules may inadvertently have put holders in danger. By creating a traceable digital footprint, he said, criminals could potentially monitor blockchain activity to identify wealthy targets.

Alexandre Stachchenko, director of strategy at French crypto exchange Paymium, echoed the concern. He said the industry “wants to be discrete and anonymous,” but EU law “tells us it’s criminal.”

Yet others in the industry dispute the claim that the EU’s regulations have played a role in the surge in attacks.

‘Strategic deflection’

Marit Rødevand, CEO & co-founder of Norwegian anti-money laundering firm Strise, said there was “little evidence” of a connection between the union’s rules and crypto kidnappings.

“While it is easy for champions of crypto to postulate that the increased physical attacks on those operating in the space are a product of regulations, this is both reductive and a strategic deflection away from legitimate security concerns,” she said.

According to Rødevand, it is just as likely that information about potential targets was accessed through hacks, social media exposure, or publicity. Many crypto entrepreneurs are also prominent influencers.

Christopher Whitehouse, a crypto expert and solicitor at London-based law firm RPC, also made no connection. Instead, he said those holding high amounts of cryptocurrency were “obvious targets.”

“The recent surge in crypto-motivated kidnappings in France is alarming but not surprising,” Whitehouse told TNW.

He noted that cryptocurrencies have several features that make them attractive for ransom. They can be transferred instantly, are difficult to trace if moved by sophisticated criminals, and lack the safeguards of traditional bank accounts. Traditional currency, in contrast, can be tracked via serial numbers.

Exploiting human vulnerability

The recent violence in France, while brutal, is also not anything new. According to data compiled by crypto security advocate Jameson Lopp, over 200 physical attacks against Bitcoin and cryptocurrency holders have been reported since 2014. Some have been fatal.

Matt Green, head of blockchain technology disputes at London law firm Lawrence Stephens, contends that the violence boils down to criminals exploiting the weakest link in the crypto chain: people.

“The only thing stopping criminals [from] gaining access is human error or force, so kidnapping aims to break down the integrity of that human-led security,” he told TNW.

To protect themselves, some high-wealth crypto holders have beefed up their personal security, including hiring bodyguards.

Green suggests another layer of protection: multisignature wallets, a type of crypto wallet that requires multiple users to perform certain tasks, such as making transfers.

Just as some shops display signs saying no cash is kept on premises, crypto holders would do well to make it clear that a single individual cannot access funds, Green said.",,"Siôn Geschwindt, Story By","industry, crypto, little, criminals, aided, security, rules, told, holders, kidnappings, regulations, eu, law, laws, evidence, france",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:25.065636+00:00,615d2c870b9f824f32021df9c88bfed106d8baf1af98d37a5eb716c0e5f54217

The widely held view of AI often gets stuck on the image of a sophisticated chatbot, capable of engaging in a conversation with a user and providing a response to prompts. But this way of thinking is also a limitation, boxing the technology into something as simple as trading messages and images. It misses both the nuance and full potential of state-of-the-art, real-world applications.

As businesses, societies, and technical practitioners alike seek to unlock the value of AI, tapping an expanded set of capabilities has become a top priority. Capital One has delivered a recent breakthrough by building a new multi-agentic conversational AI assistant for car buyers.

Capital One has a long history of using data, technology, and analytics to deliver superior financial services products and services for millions of customers. For over a decade, the business has been on a technology transformation journey to rebuild its tech stack, scale its technology workforce, and extend machine learning across the business. This dedication to innovation has positioned the company at the forefront of enterprises creating industry-leading AI advances today.

“We are continually exploring ways to enhance the customer experience at the frontier of AI. As we dug into new ways to improve the shopping experience with AI, we were looking at how to provide natural and satisfying interactions based on the way humans interact and reason,” says Dr. Milind Naphade, SVP of Technology, AI Foundations at Capital One. “We wanted to transform the customer experience by replacing the previous generation of conversational AI technology with an agentic approach that leverages large language models (LLMs). We knew we needed to build a solution that would be able to really interact with a customer, understand their needs, and take actions on their behalf while they searched for a new vehicle.”

The result: Chat Concierge from Capital One. The proprietary multi-agentic conversational AI assistant is custom-built to enhance the experience for car buyers and dealers alike. But answering questions and organizing information is only one part of what Chat Concierge can do.

Model advances have enabled the dawn of AI agents that are trained to work together and tackle a series of complex tasks. Each AI agent performs a specific duty based on the user’s request. Breaking a given workflow into discrete tasks and assigning each task to an AI agent can help ease the cognitive load of the user and create a more streamlined, satisfying experience. It’s almost like building a dream team where each member is assigned to a role fitting their strengths.

With Chat Concierge, multiple AI agents work together to not only provide information to the customer, but to take specific actions based on the customer’s preferences and needs. For example, one agent communicates with the customer. Another creates an action plan based on business rules and the tools it is allowed to use. A third agent evaluates the accuracy of the first two, and a fourth agent that explains and validates the action plan with the user.

In a single conversation, Chat Concierge can present information like vehicle comparisons and specifications, then take the next step by scheduling appointments and test drives with a sales team. “There is a complex workflow that is getting executed behind the scenes, but it’s all happening behind the scenes,” Naphade explains.

These advances come as a logical progression from generative AI to AI agents that understand their environment, make decisions, and take actions. This requires an underlying infrastructure where the data and application programming interfaces (APIs) are AI-ready. “We are standing on the shoulders of all the giant systems Capital One has built so far,” Naphade says. “For example, we are one of the only banks that has fully committed to a public cloud. The data-driven, machine learning heritage of Capital One precedes us.”

The possibilities for agentic AI–and future advances in the field–continue to evolve at a rapid clip. State of the art reasoning models are now designed to handle complex tasks by thinking through multiple steps and reasoning logically. Using these models to create AI agents brings the potential to help people turn insights into action for a range of sophisticated tasks that were never possible before. For instance, they have the potential to help solve real-world challenges like working together to tackle complex, PhD-level research problems; work with a company’s developers to autonomously support the entire software development lifecycle, from planning to deployment; or even help a new business create a business plan and financial models along with a logo, website, and marketing plans.

While the pace of AI innovation excels, so does the need for thoughtful approaches that balance speed with risk management. Capital One has tested, learned, and adapted its multi-agentic conversational AI workflow to create a great customer experience, in real-time, while also mitigating hallucination and errors through strong guardrails.

In continuing to advance the state of the art in AI, Capital One isn’t just inventing new tools and technology. It’s delivering the right help at the right time—with intelligent, dynamically adaptive approaches—for more than 100 million customers.

174,theverge.com,https://www.theverge.com/news/675502/bead-program-fiber-internet-paused,The plan for nationwide fiber internet might be upended for Starlink,2025-05-28T16:32:28+00:00,"is a former weekend editor who covered tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

For about 15 percent of US households as of 2023, the only internet options are crappy, especially in rural areas. But thanks to the US Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) program, which aims to connect everyone in the US to high-quality, mostly fiber-based internet, that’s close to changing. Or at least, it was.

The plan’s lead architect, Evan Feinman, says that before he was forced out by the Trump administration in March, three US states were just one “minor administrative step” away from connecting their first residents under BEAD. In fact, he says, they could have started the process already — if not for US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, a recent Trump appointee. In March, Lutnick announced a “rigorous review” of BEAD, which he claims is too “woke” and filled with “burdensome regulations.” Now the plan may change.

Lutnick’s changes to BEAD could hand a lot of the program’s money over to private interests like Elon Musk’s satellite internet provider, Starlink. And for every person whose home is served by a Starlink connection, their internet will likely be slower, less reliable, and more expensive than what BEAD might have gotten them with fiber.

You can think of BEAD as a modern version of the nationwide US telephone network or electrification projects. It’s been more than three years since the Biden administration established the $42.5 billion program, and so far, it hasn’t actually connected anyone to the internet — a common criticism coming from the political right. But Feinman says that’s by design.

“At every step of the game, states were screaming that we were going too fast,” he tells The Verge. “When we made allocation, more than a dozen states sent us letters saying, ‘Go slower, go slower, go slower.’” In fact, Feinman says, the first states would already have started construction if it wasn’t for delays by the Trump administration, which has been encouraging states to redo finished phases of the program to make more space for satellite internet. That shift, Feinman said in April, could effectively mean “millions of private capital is in the garbage.”

Until now, BEAD has spent its time laying the groundwork to connect people. The states were given a year and a half to come up with proposals. According to the BEAD progress dashboard, 38 states have either begun or, in the case of West Virginia, finished picking service providers for the proposals. Nevada, Delaware, and Louisiana are just waiting for final approval from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration so they can sign contracts with companies, start laying fiber, and setting up infrastructure.

“More than a dozen states sent us letters saying, ‘Go slower’”

In his March statement about BEAD’s review, Lutnick accused the Biden administration of “woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies, and burdensome regulations.” The Commerce Department “is revamping the BEAD program to take a tech-neutral approach that is rigorously driven by outcomes.”

He didn’t specify what he hoped the makeup of this “tech-neutral” approach would look like. But Feinman told Financial Times in March that before he left, Lutnick had instructed BEAD’s workers to give more priority to satellite connectivity and “singled out Musk’s provider, Starlink.” Musk, of course, has been a key player in the Trump administration as well as a vocal critic of BEAD. He’s also been accused of trying to enrich himself using his unofficial, yet seemingly very powerful position within the US government.

The Wall Street Journal reported Lutnick planned to overhaul the program in a way that could funnel as much as $20 billion, or close to half the program’s overall funds, to Musk’s Starlink. When I asked Feinman about this number, he said it’s hard to know how much more money will go to satellite networks, but that the changes Lutnick is proposing “will shift tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of locations away from getting a fiber connection and on to the satellite networks.”

As for Lutnick’s “tech-neutral” comment, Brian Mitchell, director of Nevada broadband office OSIT, says, “I think that’s what we did from the start.” Given Nevada’s vast geography and sparse population, he says, “it was never going to be realistic for us to do 100 percent fiber like you might see elsewhere.” Nevada’s final proposal called for fiber internet in 80 percent of its locations, with satellite and fixed wireless internet making up what’s left.

As an example of what’s on the line, Feinman says West Virginia’s proposal included “a fiber connection for every single West Virginia home and business” with $150 million to spare and ahead of its deadline. That sounds pretty good for a state that says it ranks 50th out of 52 (all the states plus DC and Puerto Rico) in broadband connectivity.

Now, plans like West Virginia’s could shift many of the proposed fiber connections to satellite instead. Currently, the BEAD program requires states to prioritize fiber over any other connection method for a given location, unless building it out would cost more than a certain cap — a cap each state was allowed to set. But one of Lutnick’s ideas is apparently to issue a single nationwide cap.

According to Feinman, if Lutnick’s “one-size-fits-all cap” is low enough, satellite internet companies will always win out. In Nevada, for instance, that could see the ratio of fiber-to-satellite flipping from around 80 percent fiber to about 70 percent satellite internet, according to Feinman.

Not long after Lutnick announced his BEAD review, Feinman emailed his team to say he was leaving and warned that Lutnick’s actions could mean “stranding all or part of rural America with worse internet so that we can make the world’s richest man even richer.” Feinman says that he had offered to continue running BEAD, but that the administration declined to renew his tenure.

Although Lutnick hasn’t detailed specific plans for BEAD, he’s already at work changing the program. Near the end of March, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced he’d met with Lutnick and got his state a 90-day extension that Feinman says West Virginia will use to reopen service provider bidding, endangering the state’s pending fiber agreements. The Commerce Department has since issued a blanket invitation to all states to seek such extensions. That likely means at least some states will turn to slower, pricier internet for their citizens.

There are states where Starlink makes sense. Mitchell says that his state “knew that satellite was going to play a big part in connecting Nevadans, and that’s the result that we delivered.” Satellite connections make up 10 percent of the state’s final proposal. That’s a “great result for Nevadans,” he says, adding that providers are prepared to sign contracts and start building out connections “as soon as the paperwork comes in from NIST,” or the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The first Nevadans could be connected as soon as this summer, according to Mitchell. (Neither NIST nor the NTIA responded when The Verge asked about the status of those approvals.)

Continued delays could be costly. Garry Gomes, CEO of Sky Fiber in Nevada, urged Lutnick earlier this month to push Nevada’s BEAD program forward in a letter to the NTIA forwarded to The Verge by OSIT. He said Sky Fiber — Nevada’s biggest awardee under BEAD — has “already invested over $360,000 in equipment, engineering, and staffing” and that its teams are ready to “immediately” start construction on BEAD deployment.

“Yet the project remains stalled,” Gomes wrote. “Delays not only risk higher costs and lost labor but also erode public confidence in what is arguably the most ambitious and promising broadband investment in our nation’s history.”

Would more Starlink involvement be such a bad thing? Sure, it doesn’t come close to touching fiber, but a service only has to offer over 100Mbps down and 20Mbps up, with no less than 100 milliseconds of latency, to qualify as “reliable broadband internet” under BEAD. Feinman says Starlink, while a “really really good technology,” offers service that’s “barely nosing over” that requirement. This was something that Ookla echoed in December with its median findings from Starlink users in Maine, showing that median users saw 116.77Mbps down and 18.17Mbps up. But, hey, a D minus is still a passing grade, right?

But while there’s room in BEAD for satellite internet, it’s not a replacement for hard-wired, ground-based connections. Even Musk himself has said that, having called satellite a “nice complement” to tech like fiber and 5G back in 2021.

Performance-wise, Starlink pales in comparison to fiber, which increasingly offers as much as 5 gigabits per second, down and up. That’s more than 43 times faster than Ookla’s reported median speed for Starlink. It’s 20 times faster than 249Mbps, the best-case-scenario throughput the company shows for my midwestern address. And it’s hardly worth comparing the upload speeds between the two options.

Starlink service isn’t just undeniably slower than fiber; it tends to be more expensive, too. Its fixed service is $80–$120 per month and comes with pricey upfront equipment fees. (Starlink’s site advertises $30–$50 monthly, but when I tried to sign up for service while reporting this out, the price jumped to $120 a month with a $349 equipment fee, for a “total due today” of $376.57.) In some areas, Starlink’s website says its equipment is free if you sign a 12-month contract. Meanwhile, AT&T offers a gigabit fiber plan in my city of Milwaukee for $80 per month, with a $150 equipment fee.

“Nobody is campaigning on slower, more expensive internet for their constituents”

Even if all things were equal, Feinman says the company can’t scale to the needs of the program, as it “doesn’t have the capacity to serve that many locations.” What’s more, it’s costly to maintain Starlink’s service, which requires rocket launches into space to replace dying or outmoded satellites. Subterranean fiber, on the other hand, can last decades before needing to be replaced.

Before the Trump administration started futzing with BEAD, Feinman says the program enjoyed a great deal of bipartisan support.

“This is not what anybody outside of a very small circle of Trump administration folks wanted the program to become,” he says. “This is not what Senate Republicans wanted it to become. It’s not what any member of the Democratic coalition on Capitol Hill wanted. It’s not what Republican governors wanted. It’s not what the industry wanted.”

Mitchell echoes that, saying that both Republicans and Democrats in his state have “been very supportive” and adding that “nobody is campaigning on slower, more expensive internet for their constituents.” He also says he doesn’t think that has changed as the administration changed hands. “All of our local officials and local governments are excited for who was awarded,” Mitchell says, “and are ready to start working with them to issue the necessary permits so they can move forward with deployment.” Instead, they’re waiting for Lutnick’s review.

A bipartisan group of 115 state legislators from 28 states signed a letter to Lutnick in April, stating that while they welcome some changes to BEAD, they urge him to make them optional. “At this late stage, major changes would undermine our work and delay deployment by years,” they wrote.

As for what’s next, Feinman says he’s working hard to make noise about what’s being done with the program in an effort to preserve its core mission of connecting everyone to high-speed broadband internet. His departure letter in March said he thought the BEAD program would still mostly work even without so-called “woke” requirements, which include things like fair and safe labor practices as well as outreach to historically underrepresented and marginalized groups. He also said “shovels could already be in the ground … in half the country by summer” without Lutnick’s proposed changes and that if the administration let the program move forward, “it would be a huge political win for the Trump team.”

In contrast, the most popular AI app, ChatGPT, is only blocked by 9.8% of organisations in Europe. The runner-up, Google’s Gemini, is banned by 9.2%.

Grok has been under the spotlight recently for a string of blunders. They include spreading false claims about a “white genocide” in South Africa and raising doubts about Holocaust facts.

Such mishaps have raised concerns about Grok’s security and privacy controls. The report said the chatbot is frequently blocked in favour of “more secure or better-aligned alternatives.”

Neil Thacker, Netskope’s global privacy and data protection officer, said the bans underscore a broader trend in how European organisations use popular GenAI tools.

“Businesses are becoming aware that not all apps are the same in the way they handle data privacy, ownership of data that is shared with the app, or in how much detail they reveal about the way they train the model with any data that is shared within prompts,” he said.

GenAI is now widely used across Europe, with 91% of organisations integrating cloud-based chatbots into their operations, the report found. Yet not all tools are welcomed equally.

Stable Diffusion, UK-based Stability AI’s image generator, is the most blocked AI app in Europe, barred by 41% of organisations. The app was often flagged because of concerns around privacy or licensing issues, the report found.

Gianpietro Cutolo, cloud threat researcher at Netskope, said organisations were gaining awareness of the risks around specific AI bots. “They’re becoming more savvy that not all AI is equal when it comes to data security,” he said.

The growing rejection of Grok comes amid a string of upsets across Musk’s empire, including turmoil at Tesla. The car firm’s sales in Europe have plummeted this year, with a 52% drop year-on-year in the EU last month.

Some analysts have linked the decline to Musk’s role in the Trump administration and his open support of far-right politicians. Now, similar reputational fallout may be catching up with Grok — which Musk once called the ultimate “truth-seeking AI.”

Financial institutions deal with huge sums of money every day, requiring an extraordinary degree of trust from their clients, and yet so much of this crucial decision-making is left to judgement calls and experience. Experts gather their research, draw conclusions, and make recommendations, but this process can be slow and imprecise—and all the while, fortunes hang in the balance. Overtaxed tech teams aren’t always prepared to handle every obstacle internally, and meanwhile, the work of business teams is too detailed for one-size-fits-all fixes. A field as specialized as finance demands solutions to match its complexities.

With advanced generative AI capabilities and deep institutional expertise from an experienced team, GenerativeX has already guided the pharmaceutical industry into the twenty-first century. This growing AI sophistication is now driving impact in finance, with precisely customized solutions to meet diverse needs. Instead of generic LLM assistance, GenerativeX’s AI agents are fine-tuned for financial services, informing executive strategy and eliminating tedious busywork with targeted use cases. Banking, private equity, insurance, asset management — each has room for improvement in their day-to-day. No matter the sector, no matter the business, GenerativeX’s AI agents can strengthen finance operations and recover valuable time for more effective work.

Individuality is vital in any approach to AI; its offerings must contour to the goals and workflows of a given client. AI output must take a shape that’s recognizable and useful to its intended audience: analysts can receive reports as word-processing documents or slide decks, conversational chatbots simulate in-person interactions for sales and negotiation, and higher-level ops teams can access dashboards presenting important insights at a glance. For financial institutions, being able to choose the solutions that most directly address what makes them unique creates a shorter route to success.

Consider the example of mergers and acquisitions, a field poised for overhaul with the help of AI. From end to end, the compiling of proposals for target companies can be drastically condensed with AI-driven automation, with each interconnected agent executing its designated role. Once supplied with information on the companies in question, a target analysis agent generates investment hypotheses, passing them to an orchestrator agent that coordinates research, comparative analysis, valuation, and slide-deck generation agents, while incorporating iterative feedback from a human banker at every stage. In a fraction of the time required to do so manually, a full-scale proposal comes together. Action can be taken with greater confidence, new hires learn on the job more easily, and everyone saves precious time. One major global financial institution has experienced the transformative impact of GenerativeX’s M&A agent with a 30% jump in their output of individual proposals.

AI agents can also carry a proposal through to execution, but M&A is only scratching the surface of what this technology can do for the world of finance. In real estate, AI can forecast the price of a designated property, automate the work of due diligence, and prepare transaction documents. For wealth management, it speeds up processes like succession planning, will preparation, and trust formation. Investment professionals benefit from AI-driven systems to screen deals, generate financial models, and garner committee support. Other use cases serve finance across various sectors, with the particulars adjusted for each specific business; compliance solutions, for one, are informed by each client’s internal policies. Trading, credit, insurance—AI services are changing the terrain everywhere, helping professionals navigate the complex world of finance with ease.

AI’s usefulness in securitization shows this adaptability in full force: an analyst begins the process by engaging a specialized AI orchestrator trained on the client’s proprietary knowledge database. The orchestrator then collaborates with a trust agent to review legal agreements, identifying key structural elements—such as involved parties, account relationships, and conditional triggers. The Excel agent fully automates complex financial modeling for investment banks and private equity funds. It can seamlessly handle selecting comparables, adjusting assumptions based on market information, and automating valuations and sensitivity analyses in an end-to-end process. Traditionally, analysts spend most of their time debugging models, but the Excel agent can now perform both debugging and insight generation, allowing one financial institution to save 80% of their time—a dramatic leap in both efficiency and insight.

Like any field running on data, finance involves a lot of repetitive tasks that eat up on-the-job hours without capitalizing on our human advantages. With GenerativeX’s AI solutions, we can all get these pieces of our workday back, and direct our intelligence where it’ll have a more meaningful impact. But the future of AI extends beyond streamlining and time savings to untapped new horizons of innovation in finance. Through GenerativeX’s multi-agent AI systems, users gain more leverage from their time: markets can be predicted with sharper intelligence, deals are made with less friction, and wealth goes farther. Everything’s getting smarter, and money is catching up.

And this is just the beginning, only one instance of the optimization that AI will put within reach of other domains and industries. The AI-driven speed and certitude that keep high finance running smoothly are becoming the new general standard, a swifter cadence for conducting business. As this sea change continues, the flexible, adaptable solutions of GenerativeX will be ready for whatever challenges might arise. The same targeted attention and customization that’s driving the next evolution in finance can benefit anyone, anywhere.

Powered by wind and solar, the uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs) will gather real-time data using sensors and cameras positioned both above and beneath the water. An onboard computer will stream this data to a machine learning algorithm that is trained to spot patterns and potential threats.

The technology is designed to help the Danish defence forces identify threats such as enemy submarines, illegal fishing, drug smuggling, or tampering with undersea cables. The drones will also perform deep-sea mapping to give authorities a clearer perspective of the ocean floor and underwater infrastructure, such as communication cables, pipelines, and offshore energy platforms.

Surveillance of this kind has become increasingly urgent since the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline sabotage, which exposed the vulnerability of underwater assets to covert attacks. Denmark is also stepping up its maritime defences in the Baltic Sea amid growing concerns over Russian aggression.

The robotic sailboats are made and operated by Saildrone, a US-based tech firm founded by British engineer Richard Jenkins in 2012. In its early days, Saildrone mainly focused on climate and weather surveying. But now the vast majority of its 140-strong fleet is deployed for defence and security purposes.

“The Baltic, North Sea, and European Arctic waters are currently facing unprecedented threats,” said Jenkins. “We are very excited to be partnering with the Danish armed forces to deploy Saildrone systems to help protect Europe’s critical undersea infrastructure and increase regional security.”

Denmark’s army will begin testing the four vessels in June, as part of a broader effort to beef up its high-tech defences, including deploying mine-hunting underwater drones and uncrewed surveillance aircraft.

Last month, the Nordic country announced a $614mn spending package. It will use the money to procure 26 new naval vessels, more drones, and sonar equipment in response to emerging maritime threats — particularly from Russia.

Last month, the company set up a Danish subsidiary in Copenhagen, which it hopes will bring the technology closer to key defence markets including the UK, France, and Germany.

The hype around AI continues to grow, and the technology is moving faster than even the most optimistic forecasts, reshaping what’s possible for startups almost overnight. While it’s always fun to discuss pie-in-the-sky ideas, the real question is not just what AI can do, but what it should do for your business.

Startups need measurable results: better products, faster time to market, smarter customer insights, and new revenue streams. What matters most is aligning AI with these business objectives and using infrastructure that can empower you to keep up with your competition, support growth, and please customers.

From my conversations with business leaders, the most important considerations fall into three categories:

Can I do what I do today more efficiently— faster, cheaper, or with fewer resources?

Can I grow my customer base faster and/or deliver more value to existing users?

Can I deliver new revenue from products or services I hadn’t previously considered?

The answers to these questions should help you decide where to spend time, where to invest, and how to build AI into your business.

Below are six key areas that you and other startup founders should keep in mind as you put AI to work.

1: Focus is critical

For startups, every decision matters, especially when evaluating AI choices. It’s important to make sure these investments are directly connected to business goals. Start by asking the three questions above and use the answers to help you choose the infrastructure tools needed to support your direction. In a world of distractions, focus gives you an edge. Pick tools that free up your time to solve the most important problems for your business.

One of the biggest advantages startups have today is the ability to fail fast and iterate rapidly. We’re now seeing a shift where rapid experimentation isn’t just for early-stage companies anymore. We recently worked with several customers in the core AI space that went from proof of concept to full-scale AI deployment in under three months. A year ago, that might’ve taken 12 months. Pick a cloud infrastructure partner that works the same way, enabling you to test quickly, iterate faster, and scale when you need. Focus isn’t about doing less – it’s about meeting customer needs faster.

2: Change is constant

The AI landscape isn’t just evolving—it may be accelerating faster than any other technology wave in the history of mankind. And now a new phase of agentic applications is upon us. This next wave of AI workloads will be defined by thousands of agents designed to talk to each other in short bursts to perform tasks. Imagine AI agents handling your DMV registration: one handles authentication, another takes payment, and another schedules delivery – all without you clicking through 10 screens.

This shift demands a new foundation. For this to work, agents need a standard way to talk to each other and access their data sources quickly. The Model Context Protocol is important in paving the way for a wave of AI-driven agentic applications which are designed to fetch and return responses to questions with minimal human help. Many of these applications are already emerging, with broader adoption likely in the next 12 to 18 months.

Startups seeking to capitalize on this shift must prioritize infrastructure that delivers real-time data access, low-latency networking, and the elasticity required to power agent-based ecosystems.

3: Innovation at every layer

The rapid growth of AI is driven by innovation across the entire stack, not only in the latest silicon, but in computer science techniques governing how LLMs work. Understanding this full range of innovation is crucial for staying ahead.

Take KV caching, which is the ability to reuse previous calculations for inferencing instead of recalculating everything at every step. This has the ability to save time, compute power, and money—essential factors for startups. Then there’s the Mixture of Experts technique that allows LLMs to break down complex problems and delegate each piece of the puzzle to the model—and associated infrastructure—best suited to handle it. For example, some tasks might be best served at lower cost if they run through CPUs rather than pricier GPUs. That is true for jobs relying on structured data originating in relational databases and applications, like Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications, that run on them.

When a business’s AI stack is optimized across layers, from data to model to compute, it can gain both efficiency and flexibility. This kind of innovation builds over time, and it starts with choosing infrastructure designed to support it.

4: Data remains core

Applications change all the time, but one thing remains constant: their reliance on large volumes of data, often in varying formats depending on the use case. As AI evolves toward more agentic and autonomous systems, the amount of data generated and consumed is growing exponentially. The more these systems interact, the more important it is to keep data close to where it’s being processed.

In many cases that means placing data as close as possible to required LLMs to minimize round trips that sap network performance. With Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), storage, compute, and models live side-by-side, helping to remove performance bottlenecks and maximize throughput.

Supporting AI workloads effectively while staying cost-efficient requires using a range of storage types tailored to different stages of the data lifecycle. OCI offers high-performance file systems like File Storage with Lustre for training large models, Object Storage for managing unstructured data, and Archive Storage for long-term retention, all designed to meet the price performance demands of AI-driven architectures.

Oracle brings decades of experience managing mission-critical data into our autonomous data platform. With OCI, startups can:

Seamlessly integrate advanced LLMs from a variety of providers or create your own

Parlay insights from Oracle Cloud Fusion Applications to feed their models

Tap directly into data from Oracle Database without additional integration overhead

Faster, direct access to the data not only enables improved system performance but also lays the foundation for quicker, more informed decision-making.

5: Commoditization continues

The path of technological evolution is clear: hardware horsepower rises as the price for that power is stabilizing. That trend will continue and, as noted before, innovation around the improved technology will carry on as well.

As a startup, take advantage of that commoditization and the flexibility it enables, without losing track of the problem you’re solving. What’s the value proposition, and how can cloud-powered AI help you build on it?

The right infrastructure foundation should support the pace without forcing trade-offs between cost, performance, and simplicity.

6: Be on the lookout for net-new business

Keeping your eye on the prize is critical but it doesn’t mean wearing blinders. AI is not just a tool enabling optimization—it can be a catalyst to discover completely new ideas.

While your business goals and product roadmap are being advanced, it’s important to stay alert to new opportunities that AI might surface. These may be in adjacent areas or perhaps crop up out of the blue in some orthogonal way.

Take a startup helping restaurants optimize staffing schedules. The original product is simple: use past data and forecasts to reduce overstaffing and minimize staff burnout. But over time, its AI models started surfacing that demand surges don’t match historical foot traffic. Digging deeper, the startup realized the spikes correlate with local events, weather shifts, and even social media trends about specific menu items. That insight turns into a new product altogether: a hyperlocal demand prediction API, not just for restaurants but for brands, delivery platforms, or anyone trying to forecast foot traffic and purchasing behavior. That’s not an iteration – that’s a new category creation. And it happened by noticing a signal no one was looking for.

These are the kinds of opportunities AI can unlock, helping to move from cost savings to net-new revenue and long-term business value. That’s the real potential of deploying AI with purpose: not just automation, but meaningful growth.

Speed Alone Isn’t Enough

With so much innovation across infrastructure, models, and applications, it’s easy to get caught up in chasing the newest thing. Startups are inclined to move fast and test boundaries, but sustainable impact comes from knowing where to focus.

The question is not whether to adopt AI, but where to apply it. Every initiative needs to tie back to a clear objective, whether it’s improving efficiency, accelerating customer growth, or creating new revenue. Startups that stay grounded in practical outcomes and align with the right partners are most likely to lead the next wave of innovation.

Success in AI won’t be about who moves first, but who moves with purpose, concentrates on the right problem, and makes sure the infrastructure, data, and models are aligned to solve it.

As a first-time visitor to Silicon Valley, Eddie Yu, founder of OKOsix navigated the unknown in tandem with his fellow founders, shared a flat, forged lasting bonds, and emerged from his cocoon of uncertainty with newfound confidence endowed by the Global Booster, a six-month programme organised by HKSTP, partnering with global innovation platform Plug and Play, a move to assert growth ambitions of the I&T ecosystem, provides comprehensive training and fundraising support tailored to business development needs for each startup .

“Together, we practiced and refined our presentation until it was pitch-perfect,” he recalled. Not only did he willed interests from 80 potential investors for its specialty in compostable solutions, some of them flew in Hong Kong for due diligence and see if there are even more potential for the biodegradable materials applied beyond the use in disposable medical, hygiene, and personal care products.

The unforgettable experience dubbed “once in a lifetime” by Eddie himself, offering invaluable insights that significantly changed OKOsix’s trajectory, refining plans to scale manufacturing, and adapting to global demand – this realignment allowed him to adjust fundraising strategies to prioritize growth stages. Eddie also expressed gratitude for the time spent with four other startup founders. “Their businesses are much more mature than mine,” he said, “and became a kind of guidance and inspiration for me.” The sentiment extends to the local community in more ways than one, ultimately leading to the recruitment of their new Chief Innovation Officer with a doctorate in chemistry at Stanford University, and financial advisors each chiming in respective expertise.

Said with amusement, “I still remember the looks on other countries’ startup representatives when they learned about our programme, astounded and envious in equal measure!”

Even the Intangible Gains are Off the Charts

GoGoChart serves a diverse range of enterprise customers across various industries, notably mobile gaming and finance, with an impressive portfolio boasting over 2,000 clients, GoGoChart has distinguished itself as a pioneering provider of strategies and solutions in digital marketing.

The app had its visibility optimized and conversions driven by strong online presence, tinkering with strategic boosts, algorithms for ranking, ratings, keywords, and store listings, the list goes on. Though, competition in the field remains tough nonetheless, the solution carried spotlight as a rising star in startup awards from both Deloitte and Financial Times. Given its track record, participating in the programme was a logical step for GoGoChart, empowering them to expand into the US market.

While this visit was not his first, Daniel Lo, CEO of GoGoChart found an even deeper connection with the business culture and community this time. Described as one of those awakening moments, he delved deeply into engaging with locals, and gaining a profound understanding of how the ecosystem operates.

Lo recounted: “Each day began with an early morning start, Plug and Play curated a packed schedule of sessions with mentors and investors, so we get to make the most of our time together. Dinners often featured engaging conversations with individuals from various professional backgrounds. As night fell on the West Coast, a new day began in Hong Kong; we founders worked late into the morning to stay on the line with our teams.”

He further explained that weekends often presented with unique opportunities for their professional networks to flourish. “We’d invite our new connections back to our place for a bite and get-togethers, strengthening trusts and bonds.” he said.

Despite setbacks and rejections, the networking effort ultimately paid off handsomely when Lightspeed Venture Partners, a prominent multi-stage venture capital firm, invited GoGoChart to conduct a health check on the digital marketing strategies of their portfolio companies, and from there, GoGoChart has demonstrated remarkable growth at a compound rate.

“I had the privilege of braving the unknown alongside my fellow founders in Silicon Valley,” Lo still recalled with excitement. “One particularly memorable moment was when we boldly decided to cold-pitch venture capitalists at a café in Menlo Park – a hub for these investors to congregate and share their insights.”

“Perhaps the least tangible – yet most rewarding thing – was the opportunity to surround myself with the world’s brightest minds, which only served to make me humbler and more cognizant of the importance of hard work, perseverance, and a commitment to lifelong learning.” he reflected.

The Global Booster Programme has been hailed as a transformative experience to empower startups in breaking new grounds while fostering their founders’ personal growth, as an epitome of values HKSTP holds at heart, the “booster bunch” for the second cohort is now ready to fly from the city to markets around the world, entrepreneurship will no longer perceived as a solo journey, but an exploration odyssey.",,"Cindy Zackney, Maxwell Zeff, Sarah Perez, Aria Alamalhodaei, Zack Whittaker, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, Techcrunch Events, Isabelle Johannessen, Ivan Mehta","global, silicon, eddie, hong, valley, kong, startup, venture, startups, months, growth, investors, strategies, metamorphosis, programme, founders, gogochart",pending,2025-08-15T23:51:53.227092+00:00,94f2633ecd6aad90f32d5d68e27f700f54791d743529a88d57a36dfca4bb4380

The Faroe Islands Space Program is redefining exploration by harnessing the Moon’s gravitational pull to generate clean, predictable tidal energy. With 80% of global energy still derived from fossil fuels, the need for sustainable alternatives has never been more urgent. Tidal energy, with a global potential of 650 GW, remains vastly underutilized, yet could play an important part of the future energy mix. By leveraging the ocean’s natural rhythms, this initiative challenges traditional views on space exploration and highlights the need to make the most of the resources we already have.

“We estimate there are at least 3000 more “Faroe Islands” out there qualifying for our space program – if they all join, moon energy could replace all coal power capacity currently under development globally”, says Martin Edlund, CEO of Minesto, one of the initiators of the Faroe Islands Space Program.

Luna 12 is turning the tide for renewable energy

For the past year, global industry leader SKF, ocean energy developer Minesto, and one of the world’s smallest national energy companies, Sev, have been piloting Luna 12— a cutting-edge tidal kite designed to harness the Moon’s gravitational pull for predictable, renewable tidal energy off the coast of the Faroe Islands. Luna 12 is the first mega-watt kite at a capacity of 1.2 MW – enough to power 200 homes annually, no matter the weather. Following its success, the partners have demonstrated that tidal energy can be both cost-competitive and scalable—unlocking a powerful, untapped resource that could reshape the future of clean energy.

Now, as operations in the Faroe Islands transition to the next phase, SKF and Minesto are launching the Faroe Islands Space Program. The next goal of the program is to implement a 200 MW tidal energy array, supporting the small island nation’s goal of 100% renewable energy by 2030. Once operational, the facility could supply 40% of the territory’s expected electricity needs, delivering clean, reliable energy to its 50,000 residents and 70,000 sheep in this remote North Atlantic archipelago.

How SKF and Minesto are engineering innovation for a sustainable future

Since its founding in 1907, SKF has been at the forefront of innovation in bearings, seals, condition monitoring systems, lubrication systems, and related services—all designed with one primary goal: reducing friction. With applications spanning over 40 industries, these technologies play a crucial role in fighting friction and improving efficiency. Research shows that 20 percent of all energy consumed globally is used to overcome friction. By minimizing it, we can optimize resource use, particularly in energy production, where every unit generated should contribute to the power grid rather than being lost to friction.

“Imagine a future powered by the tides of the Moon. This unique project dares to dream big and is exploring the potential of renewable tidal energy. At SKF we are proud to be a part of this down-to-earth project that aligns with our values and our ambition to create a more sustainable world,” says Annika Ölme, Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President of SKF.

Tethered to the seabed at a depth of ~50 meters and operating at speeds of 16 knots, the 12-meter-long (39.4-foot) Luna 12 kite withstands extreme forces, demanding precise engineering for smooth, controlled movement and durability. SKF was brought on board by Minesto to design the bearing and sealing systems for its rudders and elevators, optimizing performance under harsh conditions. Using advanced software, SKF also calculates bearing lifespan and CO2 emissions, helping engineers balance technical efficiency with sustainability. This initiative clearly shows how collaboration across industries is essential for progress. ”Together with Minesto, we are demonstrating how technology and innovation can drive the transition to renewable energy”, says Annika Ölme.

Why renewable and predictable moon energy is important for the Faroe Islands

The Moon’s gravitational pull is responsible for approximately 70% of tidal movement, making tidal energy, in essence, ‘moon energy’. Unlike solar, wind, and hydro power, which fluctuate with the weather, tidal energy is 100% predictable as it depends on the Moon’s orbit, which remains stable over long timescales. This predictability makes tidal energy a uniquely reliable renewable source.

The Faroe Islands’ slow-moving underwater currents pose a challenge for traditional tidal power systems, which struggle to generate sufficient energy in such conditions. This makes the region an ideal test site for Luna 12, a tidal kite designed to operate efficiently in low-flow environments. Using hydrodynamic lift, Luna 12 propels itself through ocean currents like a wind kite. Its autonomous control system steers it in a figure-eight trajectory, significantly increasing the speed of water flow through its turbine—allowing it to generate energy even in areas where conventional turbines fall short.

Sev, the Faroese municipally owned energy company, is actively supporting tidal energy development and has built key infrastructure to integrate Luna 12 into the electrical grid. With abundant natural resources and predictable tides, this project could play a crucial role in the Faroe Islands’ goal of achieving 100% renewable energy by 2030. “We believe that tidal power may prove to become a vital part of this journey,” says Hákun Djurhuus, CEO of the Faroese electricity company Sev.

The Faroe Islands Space Program highlights how knowledge-sharing and collaboration drive sustainability, showcasing tidal energy’s vast untapped potential in the renewable energy landscape. It underscores the importance of leveraging existing natural resources to build a cleaner, more resilient energy future.

149,techcrunch.com,https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/oracle/modal-founder-on-simplifying-ai-infrastructure-with-oracle-cloud-infrastructure/,Modal Founder on Simplifying AI Infrastructure with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure,2025-03-31T08:04:32,"With offices in New York, Stockholm, and San Francisco, Modal is redefining how developers build and scale AI-based applications, providing a serverless platform that eliminates the need to manage infrastructure.

Leveraging Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) AI infrastructure, Modal enables developers to run demanding AI workloads—such as model training, fine-tuning, and large-scale batch processing—without sweating the details of managing infrastructure and higher-level tooling.

In this conversation, Mahesh Thiagarajan, executive vice president, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, sat down with Modal chief executive officer, Erik Bernhardsson—who previously led engineering teams at Spotify building its music recommendation system—to discuss the challenges of AI infrastructure, why Modal chose OCI, and what’s next for AI development at scale.

Thiagarajan: Could you give us a little background on Modal and what problems you’re solving?

Bernhardsson: Modal is a serverless platform for AI, ML, and data developers. We make it easy to build and scale AI workloads in the cloud without dealing with the infrastructure headaches. Our focus is on making it easy to build applications and run AI workloads in the cloud. A lot of our work stems from frustration with existing platforms and tools, and the developer experience. Scaling AI infrastructure is hard—provisioning GPUs, managing containers, handling networking—so we built a platform where developers don’t have to think about any of that. Instead of spending weeks setting up infrastructure, they can just write code and deploy it instantly.

Thiagarajan: As a startup, what are your top challenges—tech, hiring, funding?

Bernhardsson: Hiring and growth. Right now, capital isn’t a bottleneck for us—it’s about supporting our customers and bringing in the right people to scale effectively. I’ve worked at startups for my whole career, 15-20 years—the core thing is your people and who you hire. Hire scrappy, commercially minded, smart people, and you’re 80% of the way there.

Thiagarajan: On the business side, what are some of the problems Modal is solving?

Bernhardsson: Customers want to focus on what they’re good at, which is training models or building great consumer experiences, while we handle all the scaling, infrastructure management, provisioning, and containerization. Take one of our customers, Suno. Instead of hiring a massive team to manage their infrastructure, they use Modal. We handle the compute, the scaling, and the deployment, so they can focus on their core product. Our biggest value proposition to customers is that their engineers can move faster with Modal. They don’t have to build and maintain their own platform or worry about capacity planning. With Modal, developers who are using generative AI to create new applications, such as those used to compose music or design novel protein structures, can access a platform that delivers fast and reliable GPUs. With Modal using OCI AI infrastructure, developers building on Modal can ship code, get their data and AI models into production, and test applications much faster. Customers, especially AI startups also love our serverless business and pricing model that makes it easy for them to get started with a small team and build something really cool without breaking the bank.

Thiagarajan: Can you share details about why you chose OCI and how its helping Modal solve problems for customers?

Bernhardsson: We’ve been very impressed with the hardware and the fact that Oracle offers bare metal instances, along with super-fast networking, disk and CPUs, and then the GPUs themselves, of course. OCI’s bare metal instances have been phenomenal at delivering value for our customers. We can provide the capacity our customers need, often with very short lead times. But beyond that, the agility of Oracle’s sales process has been a game changer. If I need to do a large scale out of my GPU environment, I can literally text someone and get them provisioned quickly. That kind of flexibility and partnership is rare.

Thiagarajan: AI infrastructure is getting crowded. How do you see the market? Where does OCI fit in, and how do you differentiate?

Bernhardsson: I think what Oracle is doing extremely well is managing the hardware, the compute, the data centers, and doing that at a massive scale. Modal, on the other hand, is focused on the developer experience. We provide a serverless platform with clean APIs, Python SDKs, and instant execution. It’s a different part of the stack. There’s plenty of room for multiple players in this space. OCI AI infrastructure provides the raw power, and we make it easy for developers to access and scale it without friction.

Thiagarajan: Everyone’s talking about AI, but what’s underreported or overlooked?

Bernhardsson: I think audio and music are interesting. Historically, music tech has often been ahead of the curve—whether it was the gramophone, MP3s, or music streaming. Big shifts in technology tend to show up in music before spreading to other areas. We’ve seen a lot of AI applications already, but I still feel like we’re very early in understanding where this is all going. Fast forward 10 or 20 years and I think AI-generated music and audio will be far beyond where we are today. It’s exciting to watch because I think there’s a lot of untapped potential that people aren’t talking about as much as other AI breakthroughs.

Thiagarajan: What broader AI trends do you find interesting?

Bernhardsson: One of the most exciting shifts is the realization that AI breakthroughs don’t have to rely on massive compute budgets. It’s been a little frustrating for me as someone with a math, computer science, and physics background because I want to believe in small, lean, scrappy teams solving very hard problems. Major breakthroughs weren’t capital-limited—they were driven by lean teams making clever innovations. A small, smart team that’s focused can also make a lot of progress. If AI is going to break through and change this world, we need it to be available to small teams. There are very few technological breakthroughs in the past where capital was the limiting factor, right? It’s often small teams with innovative, clever applications that drive things.

Thiagarajan: I think the point you’re illustrating is that continuous innovation can mean finding creative ways to use hardware to get the same outcome a lot more efficiently, right?

Bernhardsson: Exactly. We’re going to see a major shift toward efficiency in AI infrastructure. If we look back 15 or even 10 years ago, you didn’t need a billion dollars to make a breakthrough. But now you need it. Over the next 10–15 years, I expect AI training costs to drop by orders of magnitude as we refine models, improve algorithms, and develop efficient hardware. We still have a long way to go, and AI training is wildly inefficient compared to the human brain. There’s so much room for improvement, and that’s where the next wave of innovation will come from.

Using a combination of AI cameras and ultrasonic sensors, this smart system scans the pool post-cleaning and identifies any leftover debris. If the robot detects leaves, dirt, or floating debris, it recalibrates its path to target those specific areas before completing its cycle. This feature ensures every cleaning session is as thorough and efficient as possible.

Its AI-driven debris recognition improves over time, with continuous software updates further enhancing its ability to identify and differentiate various types of leaves.

Beyond Cleaning: A Truly Comprehensive Pool Maintenance Solution

To ensure full coverage, the AquaSense 2 Ultra features an industry-first submarine propulsion system that allows it to seamlessly navigate between pool zones without interruption.

Green Tech from Local Roots to Globally Approved

Behind the glamour of innovation, it all comes down to making a better way of living, and that “living” supposedly reaches beyond humankind. Coral reefs have been suffering from the destruction of the marine ecosystem with climate change, pollutants, and overharvesting. Archireef, which came along in 2020, is pioneering the restoration.



Founded in Hong Kong, Archireef introduced a new use for terracotta clay and made the world’s first 3D-printed Reef Tiles™ that gives a chance to hold off the damage and wins championship in the Elevator Pitch Competition (EPIC) 2021.



Last year alone, EPIC put over 600 entries of international innovators from 47 economies in one spot, as the largest tech event in Hong Kong, it’s destined for “growth” to soar from there.



Since then, widespread recognition has brought Archireef to the Middle Eastern coast, with backing from Abu Dhabi Developmental Holding Company (ADQ) secured, one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the region, the partnership has not only meant capital but has also large-scale production of end-to-end eco-engineering solutions is able to steer the company towards global expansion in marine conservation and managing nature risks in the oceans.

That explains the growing client base of the nature-risk management company, local and international corporations including Swire Bulk, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), AD Ports Group, Sino Group and Chow Sang Sang, all contributing to climate resilience and biodiversity recovery in mitigating long-term risks and costs.

Digital Health Tech Potential in Applying to be Physicians Assistants

Imagine a group of data scientists huddled over in Silicon Valley and come up with yet another adaptation of AI – pretty much how Leapstack was founded back in 2016. By leveraging AI and machine learning, its platform can be trained to analyze claimant data and provide personalized recommendations, insurers across countries are able to streamline claim processes and optimize policies.



“We aspired to become to go-to for health insurance players around the world.” Cole Gu, Co-founder and CEO of Leapstack says, fully aware of the obstacles where Insurtech is not a one-size-fit-all with risk scenarios, compliance and regulatory vary from country to country.



A eureka moment doesn’t guarantee success if it lacks investment opportunities or partnership support – exactly what EPIC offers, to put the misery to the often dire situation for startups to get their ideas off the ground.



“Once the match between startups and their support system hit it off, it’s all smooth sailing from there.” would be outright a dream too good to be true. Following Leapstack’s participation in EPIC 2023 all the way to the semifinals, they’ve continued evolving into a leading digital healthcare platform in Asia with a strong presence in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Indonesia, and its origin, Mainland China, going from mere coverage in Shanghai, to taking on nearly one-third of social medical insurance fund monitoring projects in the market, had them becoming a trusted service provider for claim management systems of top-tier international health insurers including Manulife and AIA in the Chinese society, leveraging cutting-edge AI to reshape the health insurance value chain and connect stakeholders.



That earned more than a ticket but an invitation from HKSTP to join its Elite programme, exclusive for those that show potential to head for global markets, the three-year milestone-based funding initiative consist of expert guidance, funding support, as well as comprehensive go-to-market strategies for more, according to Gu, “a presence in the Hong Kong market itself is a defining moment for us. We’re drawn to Hong Kong’s sound regulatory environment and strong global reputation in the insurance and reinsurance markets. Use cases that can be easier in adapting to other emerging markets also helped making this rather easy call operating in Hong Kong.”



Not to mention that Hong Kong boasts the highest global insurance penetration rate and the second-highest insurance density, solidifying its position as an Insurtech innovation hub, despite its relatively small population of 7.5 million.



Leapstack also embarked on another rewarding international journey led by HKSTP, “In January, we participated in the ‘Think Business, Think Hong Kong’ event in Jakarta, Indonesia to explore opportunities across Asia, ” notes Gu on his observations, “Customers in emerging markets are increasingly aware of their health protection gaps and purchasing coverage as a result.” and prior to that, Leapstack joined the delegation visiting the UAE last year to meet with local technical partners, industry leaders and regulatory bodies, extending the experience of international support.

Epic Traction for Tech and Talent

These inspiring stories are part of the reason EPIC kept going and announced its 9th edition will be competing for an investment pool of 100 million and cash prize of $240,000 in three tech tracks – Digital Health Tech, Green Tech, FinTech. A global open call for innovators has just appeared on the radar, and finalists from all corners will be flown to cruise terminal in Hong Kong for the finale to unfold in November.



Not just any competition. essence of the event is to break something, of borders, of sectors, of limits – if past years were any indication, anticipation for outreaching overseas should only build from now on for EPIC 2025, open calling global registration until 17 June 2025, 23:59 (GMT +8) – it’s about time to make your own EPIC story, visit epic.hkstp.org to learn more.

During his SXSW keynote on Wednesday in Austin, Texas, the musician joked about using ChatGPT to determine which songs to play for his shows.

In an interview conducted by Tom Morello (of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave), Fogerty was asked how he decided on a setlist for a given evening, like his concert at SXSW the previous night.

“I just go on ChatGPT or whatever,” Fogerty said, leading the audience to howl with laughter.

He then added that “you learn a whole lot trying to be an entertainer,” and said he just wanted people to have fun at the concert. “I want them to join in. I want them to sing along.”

The interview also touched on CCR history, music publishing rights, and the stories behind some of the band’s songs, among other things.

At one point, Fogerty also pointed out how the medium we use to consume music defines how it’s presented.

“Songs have always sort of been manifested by the medium that they’re on. I mean, the three-minute song or so was invented because of the 78 record. You just couldn’t put more stuff in there,” he said. Then the LP came along and CDs, which led to people having albums with far more songs, even 19- or 21-track albums.” (He said he didn’t think this was a great idea, for what it’s worth, adding that “after six or seven songs, put it on the next record!”)

Today, the medium we use to consume music is streaming, which means that distribution is in some ways more democratic, Morello said, although there’s less of a funnel as thousands of new songs are released daily.

CCR has over a billion streams, however, which Fogerty said was “magical and remarkable.”

“If your song is streamed, especially to a great degree, it means that young people are listening to it, because that’s their media: streaming,” he said.",,"Karyne Levy, Kirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, Kyle Wiggers, Sarah Perez, Maxwell Zeff, Aria Alamalhodaei, Zack Whittaker, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort","sxsw, johnson, song, interview, fogerty, waymo, streaming, means, musk, live, songs, morello, health, medium, final, ride, uber, tips, music",pending,2025-08-15T23:50:26.445789+00:00,1ed18c903761e27a7bd6d5d2cd85465c8b11e3d475ccc20ec98d98eb29d40856

What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit.

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

It costs twice as much as OpenAI’s GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

OpenAI research lead Noam Brown thinks AI “reasoning” models could’ve arrived decades ago

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI says it has trained an AI that’s “really good” at creative writing

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all.

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.

Please write a metafictional literary short story… — Sam Altman (@sama) March 11, 2025

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI reportedly plans to charge up to $20,000 a month for specialized AI ‘agents’

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

ChatGPT can directly edit your code

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

ChatGPT’s weekly active users doubled in less than 6 months, thanks to new releases

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch.

February 2025

OpenAI cancels its o3 AI model in favor of a ‘unified’ next-gen release

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model.

ChatGPT may not be as power-hungry as once assumed

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

OpenAI now reveals more of its o3-mini model’s thought process

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

You can now use ChatGPT web search without logging in

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI unveils a new ChatGPT agent for ‘deep research’

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

January 2025

OpenAI used a subreddit to test AI persuasion

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post.

OpenAI launches o3-mini, its latest ‘reasoning’ model

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

ChatGPT’s mobile users are 85% male, report says

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT’s mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launches ChatGPT plan for US government agencies

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

More teens report using ChatGPT for schoolwork, despite the tech’s faults

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says it may store deleted Operator data for up to 90 days

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company’s AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s.

OpenAI launches Operator, an AI agent that performs tasks autonomously

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

OpenAI may preview its agent tool for users on the $200-per-month Pro plan

Operator, OpenAI’s agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website.

OpenAI tests phone number-only ChatGPT signups

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT now lets you schedule reminders and recurring tasks

ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

New ChatGPT feature lets users assign it traits like ‘chatty’ and ‘Gen Z’

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely.

FAQs:

What is ChatGPT? How does it work?

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

When did ChatGPT get released?

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

What is the latest version of ChatGPT?

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.

Can I use ChatGPT for free?

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Who uses ChatGPT?

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

What companies use ChatGPT?

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

What does GPT mean in ChatGPT?

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

What is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Can ChatGPT write essays?

Yes.

Can ChatGPT commit libel?

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Does ChatGPT have an app?

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

What is the ChatGPT character limit?

It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Does ChatGPT have an API?

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

What are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

What are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

How good is ChatGPT at writing code?

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used.

Can you save a ChatGPT chat?

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Are there alternatives to ChatGPT?

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

How does ChatGPT handle data privacy?

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

What controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Where can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Can ChatGPT be detected?

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they’re inconsistent at best.

Are ChatGPT chats public?

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users’ conversations to other people on the service.

What lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Are there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

But TechCrunch’s Kirsten Korosec couldn’t help but notice that not one American automaker could be found at this year’s event, unless you count VW Group’s U.S. spinoff Scout Motors. Several Chinese automakers filled that void, notably Zeekr, the EV brand owned by China’s Geely Holdings.

Circular has just released a new smart ring that offers two key advantages over Oura, which currently dominates the global market for the trendy wearables, which monitor your health metrics and display the info on an app.

Dubbed the Circular Ring 2, it’s a quantum leap forward from its predecessor, the Circular Slim, which The Verge described as a product that held “a lot of promise” but executed on “almost none of it.”

Firstly, Circular has swapped the plastic shell in the old ring for titanium which is available in four finishes: black, silver, gold, and rose gold. The ring’s sensors have been given a complete overhaul, resulting in more accurate readings, the company said.

Circular has also scrapped the USB charger for a wireless charging dock. The Ring 2’s battery life lasts up to an impressive eight days, one more day than the Oura Ring.

However, the main innovation — a first for smart rings — is the addition of an FDA-cleared atrial fibrillation (AFib) sensor that reads the electrical activity of your heart, including the rate and rhythm.

As a result, Circular goes on to call its new ring a “discreet heart health companion.” It’s a bit cheesy, but the AFib sensor could provide a warning of an incoming stroke or heart attack — so the tagline has some substance.

Circular has also introduced a potentially game-changing digital sizing process. Instead of having to purchase a physical sizing kit prior to buying a smart ring, Circular allows you to measure your finger directly from your phone.

“This isn’t just a wearable,” said Amaury Kosman, Circular’s co-founder and CEO. “It’s a statement piece that empowers our users to take control of their wellness without compromising on style.”

While the Ring 2 is a complete upgrade, the company has done away with a haptic motor that served as a vibrating alarm clock in the first iteration.

The Circular Ring 2 is expected to launch via a crowd-funding campaign in mid-to-late January before shipping in March with a starting price of $380. That’s a bit pricier than the Oura Ring 4 ($349). However, unlike Oura’s, the Circular ring is available subscription-free.

While Circular’s new smart ring sounds great on paper, it remains to be seen whether it can pull it off and produce reliable devices at scale. If it does prove a success, that won’t necessarily be a bad thing for Oura though. The Finnish company receives a royalty fee for all Circular rings sold in the US, based on a multi-year patent infringement agreement signed last year.

In the words of Editor Frederic Lardinois, who is on the ground in Las Vegas right in the midst of all things re:Invent 2024:

“As far as re:Invent keynotes go, there was plenty of news, but the overall experience felt a bit disjointed, with AWS CEO Matt Garman going deep into the weeds of some new and existing services at the start. He was then upstaged by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announcing new foundation models — which was maybe the marquee moment of the event so far — only to then have to go back to announce updates to Amazon Q and SageMaker.”

Those new models include four text generators, an image generation model and a video generation model, all of which follow the new Nova naming convention.

“We’ve continued to work on our own frontier models,” Jassy said, “and those frontier models have made a tremendous amount of progress over the last four to five months. And we figured, if we were finding value out of them, you would probably find value out of them.”

夫が秘書と不倫していることを知ってしまったニューヨークの女性は、いったいどうすべきなのか？ マダム・メイゼルの場合、寝間着のままバーに行き、少しコメディ・パフォーマンスを披露した後、観客全員の前で服を脱ぎ、警察に連行されるだろう。

早口でおしゃれで少し奇抜なコメディアンを主人公としたこのドラマは1950年代を舞台に、家族や元夫からコメディアンとしてのキャリアを隠しながら、性差別や失礼な観客、そして厳しい競争に立ち向かう女性を描いている。レイチェル・ブロズナハンが演じるミッジ・メイゼルの役は、ジョーン・リバーズのキャリアにさりげないオマージュを捧げている。このシリーズは4シーズンあり、数多くの賞やノミネートを誇る。Amazonプライム・ビデオでも最も鋭いコメディのひとつだ。

『グッド・オーメンズ』

悲惨なニュースやディストピアがテーマの番組が多すぎて、気持ちが暗くなりがちな人には「グッド・オーメンズ」が心の避難所となってくれるだろう。ニール・ゲイマンが、テリー・プラチェットと共著した1990年の小説を自ら脚色しており、天使（マイケル・シーン）と悪魔（デイビッド・テナント）が世界の終わりを阻止しようとする物語だ。冷戦時代っぽい馬鹿げた内容や、皮肉な英国的ユーモアも満載。6つのエピソードは、どれもファンが期待するものを提供してくれる。

And he is bullish on Elon Musk’s vision for Tesla’s and the world’s future, but he’s not without his, albeit small, reservations.

“I think the issue isn’t building the car without a steering wheel, it’s making the software work,” Levandowski told TechCrunch. “There’s a lot of gap between driving around on a track at an amusement park and driving around in Los Angeles traffic. The optimism is there. The realism is what’s coming next, and that will be where the hard part is.”

The engineer agreed with Musk’s vision-only approach to self-driving, rather than using “expensive sensors,” and said full self-driving appears to be in reach. He noted that while Waymo already has fully operational driverless robotaxis in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, it’s a “much more engineer-heavy and sensory-heavy approach.”

“But to scale that out to the masses, you need something that’s affordable,” he said. Levandowski noted that he was really looking for Tesla to announce breakthroughs in its FSD software, which it will need if it wants to get to unsupervised FSD by next year.

When it comes to the business model, Levandowski said he loved the idea of the Cybercabs being available for sale eventually.

“You’re putting the power back into the people’s hands, where a small business owner could have, you know, a fleet of 10 cars or 20 cars that they run themselves as their business. It’s a great model for the future where it’s lots of mom and pops, rather than one mega corp that does that.”

The engineer said he agrees with Tesla’s vision of the future overall, but doesn’t expect it to come anytime soon, and certainly not within the timelines Musk sets.

“If you can’t start a webcast on time, maybe your prediction for 2026 is a little ambitious,” Levandowski said, referencing Musk’s stated timeline that the Cybercab would start production in 2026. (Also, the event apparently started late because a guest had a medical emergency, but Musk’s timelines are famously too optimistic.)

Levandowski also said he was bullish on the Optimus robots, which were mingling with guests at the event Thursday.

“But it’s a longer term bullish,” he said. “It’s not bullish this year. It’s a bullish over time…Robots in general are going to be the biggest product. They’re gonna be way bigger than Tesla cars, but they’re much further away than full self-driving cars.”",,"Morgan Little, Rebecca Bellan, Maxwell Zeff, Sarah Perez, Aria Alamalhodaei, Zack Whittaker, Connie Loizos, Julie Bort, .Post-Authors-List__Authors --Font-Size Var, Align-Items Center Display Flex Gap Var","tesla, including, teslas, showed, engineer, musk, levandowski, elon, future, business, cybercab, cars, musks, robovan, event, robot, bullish, start, selfdriving",pending,2025-08-15T23:51:22.616362+00:00,4c215711970c771222d7d87d197f949d98f0d780c3879c283a1c35e140991f52

343,thenextweb.com,https://thenextweb.com/news/science-breeding-booming-deeptech-startups-estonia,Science is breeding a new generation of booming deeptech startups in Estonia,2024-09-15T07:00:25+00:00,"Back in the early 2000s, Estonia was rapidly modernising, shaking off the remnants of Soviet influence. It was ambitiously transforming itself into a digital society with innovations such as e-government and online voting.

And, of course, it gave birth to Skype, the company that would launch the small Baltic nation’s journey towards becoming a startup powerhouse and a “unicorn country.”

Since then, Estonia has established itself as a leader in breeding high-profile software companies, such as Bolt and Wise. Now, it’s aiming to become a deeptech hub, accelerating the development of research- and science-based entrepreneurship.

Deeptech in Estonia is still relatively young. As many as 70% of the companies have emerged over the last five years.

Nevertheless, the sector is growing quickly. In 2023, deeptech startups reached a record €227.2mnin turnover — a 14% increase from the year before. They also raised €394mn, rising from €254mn the previous year.

Towards a deeptech hub

The Estonian government’s vision is for deeptech companies to account for about 30% of the country’s total startup volume by 2030. This translates into 500 deeptech startups — up from 132 in 2023.

One key component of Estonia’s action plan is to facilitate further access to funding, mainly in the form of grants and angel investment, especially for early-stage businesses.

Another is boosting entrepreneurship within academia with dedicated courses for students. Equally important is ensuring a smooth spinout process.

According to Sten Tamkivi, early executive at Skype and partner at VC firm Plural, the Tallinn University of Technology (TalTech) and the University of Tartu have both taken active steps in the past years.

“They have created their own venture arms and they have made sure that the spinout IP and equity process is easier,” Tamkivi tells TNW.

A third component are the their startups themselves — and their ability to turn scientific advancements into commercial products.

Cosmic rays for 3D scanning

Tallinn-based GSCAN is using muon tomography for 3D scanning and chemical composition analysis.

Muons are subatomic particles that make up half the cosmic radiation reaching the Earth’s atmosphere.

GSCAN collects muons with its proprietary detector technology, which combines the use of AI to measure the flux of muons when penetrating an object, to create 3D visualisations, and analyse the materials.

GSCAN’s system is modular and can see through every material up to 20 metres in thickness. Source: GSCAN

“This is a platform technology that you can use everywhere, much like X-ray tomography,” Andi Hektor, co-founder and chief strategy officer at the startup and former researcher at CERN, tells TNW.

According to Hektor, muon tomography offers significant advantages over X-rays. Firstly, it has the ability to penetrate very large objects and provide information about the chemical composition of materials. It’s also safer for humans and the environment, as muons are a result of natural radiation.

One of GSCAN’s focus areas is non-destructive testing (NDT) for the built environment. NDT helps evaluate the properties of a material or structure for potential defects without causing damage.

Hektor provides an example.

“The world is full of old bridges, buildings, and tunnels made of reinforced concrete. Reinforced concrete has a finite lifetime and inside these structures there are metals subject to corrosion.”

“Understanding what’s happening inside these structures is vital both for safety and economic reasons,” he says.

GSCAN counts multiple projects so far, including the scanning of two old nuclear reactors for their safe decommissioning process.

Alongside the built environment, the startup is also using its technology for customs and security applications.

In March, GSCAN raised a €3mn seed round from investors including Bolt’s founder Markus Villig. This brought the total amount raised since its founding in 2018 to €5.1mn.

Green carbon nanomaterials and graphite

A spinout from the University of Tartu, Up Catalyst transforms CO2 emissions into green carbon nanomaterials and graphite.

The startup’s technology extracts CO2 from waste biomass and flue gases from heavy industry emitters. It then converts it into green carbon with a process called molten salt electrolysis.

“We’re essentially electro-transforming carbon dioxide gases into carbon nanomaterials,” Apostolos Segkos, head of development at Up Catalyst, tells TNW.

The startup’s first goal is to achieve price parity with traditional carbon sources. Its second is to reduce dependence on fossil fuel-based carbon, while minimising the environmental impact of raw material production.

According to Segkos, Up Catalyst’s mission aligns with the EU’s objectives for the energy transition and the need for securing a reliable (and ideally domestic) supply chain of critical raw materials.

“Graphite, among other key carbon products, is considered a critical material by the EU, especially as we import about 99% of it, which mostly comes from China.”

Graphite is a key component of EV batteries, which typically contain between 50kg and 100kg of the material.

For their part, carbon nanomaterials are valuable additives in energy generation and storage devices, including batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells.

In July, Up Catalyst received a €2.36mn funding boost to accelerate the development of a pilot industrial reactor.

According to the startup, the reactor will be able to produce 100 tonnes of CO2 per year, which can deliver 27 tonnes of green carbon materials.

Up Catalyst spun out from the University of Tartu in 2019.

“We had a good success case because we managed to fully transfer the IP from the university to the company,” Teele Niidas, the startup’s CMO, tells TNW.

Despite some “difficult bits” of negotiation, the spinout process was “fairly easy,” Niidas says.

“I think everyone [in the Estonian ecosystem] realises that science-based startups have a big future if they are indeed supported by academia.”

Harnessing nanotech for wound dressing

Another startup in the field of nanotech is Nanordica Medical, which has developed an antibacterial wound dressing.

A spinout from Estonia’s National Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics (NICPB), the startup sought to create a more effective solution for bacterial wound infections. These affect approximately 100 million people worldwide, including those suffering from diabetes.

“Mainstream wound dressings use silver,” Olesja Bondarenko, Nanordica’s CEO tells TNW.

“Silver has good antibacterial properties. But the problem is that it also has side effects and can lead to impaired wound healing.”

Following research, the team discovered that the key lied in combining silver with copper nanoparticles.

“We found that they amplify each other, while reducing adverse effects,” Bondarenko says.

Nanordica’s dressing works by attracting the bacteria and inactivating their effect, which enables tissue regeneration and wound healing. The Tallinn-based startup says the solution offers 8x better treatment compared to standard care products.

The company has already run a small clinical trial in Estonia with 30 diabetic patients suffering from food ulcer. Results were promising, with the wound dressing showing twice as fast healing compared to a commonly used silver alternative.

Nanordica plans to confirm these findings with an upcoming larger trial and expects to get approval by the EU’s health regulator this year.

Following the intended commercialisation of its wound dressing by 2025, the company will aim to expand its range of antibacterial products.

Nanordica recently raised €1.75mn from VC investors. In the first years after its founding in 2019, it relied on funding from the founders and grants from EIC, Enterprise Estonia, and the NICPB — from which it bought the IP.

According to Bondarenko, software has historically dominated investor interest.

“But now, I think there is a real transformation,” says Bondarenko.

“There is more and more understanding that science-based deeptech is very important. And the same investors that were focusing on software are now considering different possibilities.”

“The chances are very high that we will soon see unicorns in healthtech, and deeptech in general.”",,"Ioanna Lykiardopoulou, Story By","wound, deeptech, startup, startups, university, estonia, tells, science, technology, breeding, generation, spinout, booming, carbon",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:15.827346+00:00,480b36587a732b16c1834aa27eec2cae85373bf072496f335515868c67b230b4

Future Fifty supports startups from the Series B to the IPO stage and beyond. Since its launch in 2013, it counts alumni such as Revolut, Monzo, and Skyscanner.

“We use mechanisms of access and growth instead of learning and validation,” Johnny Mayo, programme lead of Future Fifty told TNW.

“The reason for this is our companies typically already have proven product market fit, and our founders will often already have coaches or mentors who have helped them reach this level.”

To be eligible for the programme, participants must meet a series of criteria, starting with having UK-based headquarters and a digital/tech-enabled business. They also need to be generating £5mn revenue per year or experiencing 50% YoY growth. And they need to have successfully raised Series B funding.

The selected startups in this year’s second cohort have collectively raised almost £1.2bn and employ over 2,500 staff. They’re active in various tech sectors, including healthtech, biotech, energy, quantum, and fintech.

According to Mayo, the accelerator’s approach is strongly experiential.

“While we do have mentors, coaches, and even therapists, they are a small element of the programme,” Mayo said.

“The main value add (beyond the prestige and recognition) is building networks of peers and mentors not so much around founders and CEOs, but instead their C-suite.”

This is its largest fundraise to date, Atomico says, although falling slightly short of its initial target of $1.35bn.

The total amount is a combination of two different funds. The first fund has secured $485mn for early-stage companies, primarily targeting Series A, but also including some seed investments.

The second fund will focus on growth investments, to which Atomico expanded in 2011. It will allocate $754mn to support entrepreneurs from Series B up to the pre-IPO stage.

Launched in 2006 by Skype co-founder Niklas Zennström, Atomico has employed a founder-focused approach. It counts over 155 investments across 15 European companies.

The VC firm says that one in six of its portfolio startups is currently valued above $1bn. This includes machine translation company DeepL and buy-now-pay-later unicorn Klarna.

The two new funds aim to further support Europe’s growth, as Atomico believes the region is currently emerging as a strong competitor in the global tech landscape.

“European technology is coming of age,” said Zennström.

“Data shows Europe is leading the world at the early stage with a wealth of new startups.”

The region is outpacing the US in the creation of new companies and now accounts for approximately 30% of global early-stage funding.

However, the picture is different for late-stage funding, which almost halved in 2023 compared to the previous year.

“There’s a clear need for more growth capital and for European institutional investors to step up, together with the next generation of venture funds and growth investors, to address this gap,” Laura Connell, Partner at Atomico, told TNW.

The overall fundraising environment for startups remains tough and the number of active investors in Europe’s VC ecosystem fell more than 50% in June.

But there are signs of recovery. VC investment rose to $29bn in the first half of 2024, with energy and GenAI startups driving growth.",,"Ioanna Lykiardopoulou, Story By","fund, vc, venture, atomico, preipo, startups, growth, raises, european, support, investors, series, funds, region, 124b, seed",pending,2025-08-15T23:56:13.554757+00:00,97f0681b9bdfbeea3e1cb2de09dc63505b8a7c02b44fe507cc0c4fabb6018609

Honorable Mentions

There are far too many pillows on the market. We've listed our favorites above, but even that doesn't cover the wide array of serviceable designs out there for a good night's sleep. If, somehow, all of our picks above aren't to your tastes, here are a few others we have tested and what we thought about them.

Avocado Down Pillow for $109: This down model does have feathers sourced from Responsible Down Standard (RDS)-certified farms, but it felt unimpressive and borderline flat to sleep on

Avocado Green Pillow for $119: Avocado's fill is made from GOLS-certified organic latex and GOTS-certified organic kapok, and comes in both a standard shape and side-sleeper curved shape. It felt much denser than others we tried, and my test panel and I preferred other latex pillows over this one.

Bedgear Storm Pillow for $200: This model from Bedgear is similar to the Bedgear Flow above but without the curve for side sleepers. If you sleep on your back 100 percent of the time, this might be a better fit, but I prefer the versatility of having one curved side and one straight side. –Eric Ravenscraft

Brooklinen Down Alternative Pillow for $59: I liked this better than Brooklinen's actual down pillow, since it had better spring and support. (I chose the firm option for testing.) I prefer the Buffy Cloud for a down alternative, but this is a solid runner-up.

Casper Hybrid Pillow for $129: This hybrid uses a mix of thick foam and a core of shredded foam for its marshmallow-like, dense-yet-soft feel. I liked sleeping on the Casper, especially the cooling Snow version ($149), and it did well in my panel tests, but both of my panelists who volunteered to long-term test it came back with disappointing results within a week. My petite side sleeper found it too firm, and my taller, broader long-term tester found that the Casper wasn't bouncing back quite as much as it should be for the price after a week of sleeping on it. If you like a firm-ish design, though, you could be happy with this one. The Snow version is slightly cooling, but not super cooling; more of a good winter option for hot sleepers, as one of my panel testers said.

Eli & Elm Everyday Memory Foam Pillow for $110: Compared to the latex version below, the memory foam version feels lumpy. Most of my panelists disliked it, including myself, but my chaotic sleeper was a fan of its malleable shape for her haphazard sleeping patterns.

Eli & Elm Everyday Latex Pillow for $110: This shredded latex-filled pillow is nice and springy, and it’s a solid runner-up to the Coop and Purple. I found it comfortable to sleep on as a side sleeper, since it as a higher loft and nice support.

Eli & Elm Side Sleeper Pillow for $116: This pillow is almost shockingly firm out of the box. You can customize the amount of fill inside to give it the right amount of support for you, but if you're the type of side sleeper who likes firm support, this might be the one for you. It even comes with a separate removable cover for easy washing. It's smaller than the Scrumptious one, so don't expect to do much cuddling on this one, but for one person it's a great choice. —Eric Ravenscraft

GhostBed Memory Foam Pillow for $85: Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using the memory foam GhostBed pillow since 2020—she slept on it while visiting with a friend and immediately bought one after returning home. It's medium-firm and works for her side-, back-, and stomach-sleeping rotation. GhostBed's claim of it being the “Coolest Pillow in the World” is exaggerated, but Medea sleeps hot, and she says the gel-infused foam does stay cool all night.

Marlow the Pillow for $49: This is another shredded memory foam model, though it was less lumpy and had better support than the Eli & Elm. It was a little smaller than the rest, but it also has a slight adjustment option, letting you unzip side panels to make it bigger or smaller. It was fine to sleep on; I found it a little firm for my liking, but my long-term tester says it's been supportive and cleared up her neck pain. It's a good option for the price too.

Nest Easy Breather Pillow for $119: This is a popular model, but I found it too dense and too lofty for me. It is adjustable, so you can easily make it less lofty, and it comes with a fill bag to store your extra fill. The fill is a mix of foam and polyester fiber. My panelist who liked the firmer Marlow also liked this pillow, while the rest of us preferred softer options.

No More Aches Neck Pillow for $50: There's no shortage of novelty pillows, but as someone who experiences a lot of neck pain, I'm intrigued by this odd little design. It has a concave center for back, side, and stomach sleeping, plus an indented edge that perfectly fits your arm. Its awkward shape makes it less than ideal for anything other than laying your head on it, but it's still a solid pick for neck pain. —Eric Ravenscraft

Parallel High Profile Pillow for $150: Former WIRED reviewer Eric Ravenscraft was a fan of the Parallel's high profile for taller side sleepers. It's a good option, but I think you'll be just as happy with a Purple or Coop cutout if you need a high loft and side sleeper support.

Pillow Cube Side Cube ($70) and Ice Cube ($90): The Pillow Cube has a weird little rectangular design. It seems strange at first, but once you take the quiz and get a recommendation for what size you need, you’ll be matched with the perfect cube for you. I tested the Side Cube and the Ice Cube. They were supportive and a bit squishy, and I think they’d be a good option if you sleep exclusively on your side—with your arms stretched in front of you or near your chest. I usually sleep with my arm stretched under my pillow, so my head is resting on my shoulder (with a pillow in between), and I found the Cube was less supportive if I slept in my preferred position. And on the nights when I rolled onto my back, I woke up with neck pain. But if you only sleep in the ideal side sleeper formation, this model is much more supportive than others I’ve tried. Make sure you pick up a case! A normal case is too roomy and doesn’t fit the Cube well. —Louryn Strampe

Purple DreamLayer Pillow for $199: If you find you switch between being a side sleeper and back sleeper, the Purple DreamLayer pillow provides an excellent middle ground. Rather than using adjustable fill to customize its height, this model comes with two foam inserts so you can get exactly the level of support you need. —Eric Ravenscraft

Purple GridCloud Pillow for $149: This pillow is a softer, squishier design with the grid layer we love from the Purple Freeform and Harmony, but it has only one side with the grid instead of two. It's described as having a down-alternative core, and it does feel much softer, like a down alternative. I preferred the support of Purple's other models, but if you want something softer with better support than just a down or down alternative filling, this is a great option.

Saatva Graphite Memory Foam Pillow for $165: This model is slightly cooling, and has a fluffier feel compared to more sinkage-style memory foam.

Saatva Down Alternative Pillow for $115: I like this down alternative, but not more than the much cheaper Buffy. There are two loft height options which is nice if you want something specific.

Sleep Number True Temp Adapt Ultimate Pillow for $150: I tested the Ultimate shape since it's a slight crescent-like style that's ideal for side sleepers like myself. I like this as a side sleeper option, and it's nicely cooling as well. It's a little smaller than the Coop, but still big enough for the average-sized person.

Slumber Cloud UltraCool Pillow for $79: This pillow is super chilly and super soft, similar to a down or down alternative model. If you're looking for something extra cool and like the light, malleable support of a down pillow, this is a good choice.

Snuggle-Pedic Adjustable Cooling Pillow for $57: This was our favorite pillow under $100, but it's out of stock everywhere right now. If you can find it available, it's a great option filled with shredded memory foam that you can adjust to get your perfect height.

Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Adapt ProAdjust Pillow for $125: This adjustable-fill model from Tempur-Pedic has a compartment where you can add or remove foam filling to get the perfect amount of support for you. This is an increasingly common feature, but what sets it apart is Tempur-Pedic's trademark cooling materials. The company makes some of the best cooling materials on the market, and this one managed to stay cooler than most I tried. —Eric Ravenscraft

Tempur Pedic Tempur Adapt ProHi for $175: Our previous memory foam pick did fine in my panel tests, but we all preferred shredded memory foam over a solid sheet. Someone did volunteer to long-term test this as a knee support while they slept, though.

Tempur-Breeze ProHi Pillow for $229: is a wider, more spacious alternative to the Tempur-Adapt ProHi. It has a similarly high loft, and the foam is firmer and more resistant to pressure than the Adapt. It's a better fit if you prefer a firmer option, or if you want space to share it with your cuddling partner. —Eric Ravenscraft

Understanding Pillow Sizes

There are a couple different pillow sizes you might find when shopping. Most of the time pillows come in a standard size and a king size, and you should buy a standard size unless you have a king-size bed. But there are a few more size options.

All bed pillows are usually 20 inches wide, but the length can vary. (That's why your pillowcases might seem too long—they're prepared for larger sizes!) If you're curious about more sizes or found a model that has more options to choose from than you know what to do with, here are the usual sizes you can find and what measurements they should have:

Standard Size: 20 inches by 26 inches

20 inches by 26 inches Super Standard Size: 20 inches by 28 inches

20 inches by 28 inches Queen: 20 inches by 30 inches

20 inches by 30 inches King: 20 inches by 36 inches

20 inches by 36 inches Body: 20 inches by 54 inches

You'll want to double-check listings to see what size you're really working with if size is an issue for you. Buffy, for example, lists a standard size for its pillows, but they're 28 inches long, making those pillows a super standard size. You won't want to order king-size pillows without a king-sized bed, especially since you'll need king-size pillowcases with your sheets. Body pillows are the longest of all, and we have a separate guide to those.

Frequently Asked Questions What Kind of Pillow Do You Need? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron You might think a pillow is a pillow. It just has to be soft and fit under your head, right? Your head, neck, and back disagree. Getting a good night’s sleep can depend heavily on your pillow, so when choosing one, here are a few key questions to ask. What kind of sleeper are you? Do you sleep on your back, side, or stomach? Do you stay relatively still, or do you toss and turn a lot? Do you usually have one pillow under your head, or do you cocoon yourself into a pillow chrysalis? This is probably the most important thing to keep in mind when deciding what type works best for you, and we've noted our picks below based on sleeping style. What is the pillow made of? Pillows can be filled with all types of materials, from feathers to foam. Down and synthetic down are fluffy clusters of fiber that can feel soft and comfortable, whereas memory foam is designed to compress with the weight of your head but still return to its previous shape. Organic latex can be heavy and spongey, holding a side-sleeper's head in place. There are also hybrid pillows that use multiple layers of different materials for a more structured feel. How are the materials sourced? Since some materials like down feathers come from animals, you might want to be aware of how manufacturers get their fill (literally). Down filling typically comes from the belly feathers of either ducks or geese. In order to ensure that down feathers are ethically sourced—such as by avoiding cruel practices like live plucking—programs like the Responsible Down Standard set criteria that manufacturers must adhere to. Another option is to look for synthetic down alternatives, which use cotton, rayon, or polyester as a synthetic replacement. The broader Material Matters Standard is a recently overhauled system for examining the environmental impact and sustainability of bedding manufacturers. How firm is it? However you sleep, you'll want a pillow that keeps your spine straight and your head aligned with your back. That means you want something firm enough to support your head yet soft enough that it doesn't dig into your ear or face. How lofty is it? “Loft” is a term often used to describe how high off the bed the pillow keeps your head. If it's too tall, for example, you might end up with your neck tilted upward, straining it throughout the night. Most models typically fall into one of three categories: Low loft, which is relatively short and ideal for back sleepers; high loft, which is better for side sleepers (since your head will be further off the bed than when you're on your back); and medium loft, which is somewhere in the middle and best if you're a combination sleeper who doesn't stick to one particular sleep style. What is the warranty and return policy? You might not think the pillow you sleep (and sweat and drool) on would have a robust warranty, but many manufacturers offer generous policies. For example, Purple offers a one-year warranty and even a 100-night trial period. Casper has a similar warranty and a 30-day trial. If you're unsure whether your new pillow is right for you, check out the company's policies to see what leeway you have to try before you commit—and make sure you’re protected if something goes wrong. What's the Best Pillow Fill for You? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron A variety of filling materials are used, and the type of fill is a big part of how pillows are categorized. You've heard of down pillows, for example, which means it's full of down undercoating or feathers, and hearing the words “memory foam” usually invokes the sinking sensation that good memory foam can give. Here's a quick explainer of the main types of fill you'll find and how they differ. Down: Down pillows, as I mentioned above, are filled with either down clusters (an undercoating on ducks) or down feathers, or a mix of both. It's a fill that's been around for ages, and it feels similar to a comforter in the sense that it's soft and squishy, and very malleable to shape in any way you prefer. (But it also doesn't retain its shape well.) Since these are filled with down clusters or feathers, you'll want to check for certifications, like the Responsible Down Standard (RDS), that confirm if the down was ethically sourced. Down alternative: These pillows aren't a set type, but use other materials to replicate the down experience. Buffy, for example, uses recycled plastic to create their fill, while Saatva uses a combination of memory foam and latex foam. You'll have to take a look to see what makes up any down alternative design, since it isn't consistent. But what is consistent is the different feel. In my tests, I've found down alternative models are usually more supportive and do a better job holding their shape than a classic down. Memory foam: Memory foam is popular since it can “remember” its original shape, letting it return to its previous form once your head is off the pillow. Memory foam does have a sinking sensation to it, which you might like or dislike. You'll also want to check if the memory foam is a solid sheet or shredded; I've found shredded and cut memory foam to have more bounce and support and less sinkage than a memory foam sheet. Latex foam: Latex foam is made from rubber, giving it a much bouncier, supportive feel than other foam options. Latex foam is becoming a popular option thanks to that nice support, and it is usually found with a shredded type of fill that gives plenty of airflow. Hybrid: Hybrid is another category gaining in popularity. It can be a mix of any of the above fills, but I often find it's a sheet of foam combined with either shredded foam or some other kind of softer filling. Casper, for example, uses both sheets of memory foam and then has a core of shredded foam at the center to give it its marshmallow-like feel. Cotton, kapok, and wool: These fills are all natural fibers that take less processing than foam, and could be used in a blend with other materials above. Kapok and cotton are supposed to be on the fluffy end, while wool is great for temperature regulation. But none are as popular as foam or down options, though you might see these as ingredients in organic or hybrid options. Are Standard and Queen the Same Pillow Size? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron No, a standard size is a little smaller at only 26 inches wide, while a queen size should be 30 inches wide. You might want to check the measurements in case it's mislabeled to be the same thing, but if you have the choice between the two, I prefer a few extra inches with the queen size. Why Should You Spend So Much on a Pillow? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron You might be surprised by some of the price tags on these pillows. I remember spending bottom dollar on my pillows for years. But those bottom-dollar pillows needed to be frequently replaced and didn't provide the long-term support (or even all-night support) my neck needed. Higher-quality pillows cost more but will use better materials, last longer, and come with trial periods and warranties so that you can test out the pillow of your choice and get a guarantee it'll last. Plus, while most of these aren't cheap, it's still an affordable investment when you break down how many hours you'll be lying on them. How Should You Care for Your Pillow? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The best way to wash your pillow is going to depend on the pillow you have. You can choose to hand wash, spot clean, or machine wash pillows, though you'll want to check the label and make sure it's safe to machine wash it. If it's not, spot or hand cleaning is your best option. The easiest pillows to clean are ones that come with removable covers, because you can remove said cover and wash it with other sheets and bedding. Not all pillow fill should be washed, so that's important to check before throwing an entire pillow into your washing machine. Our top five picks all have removable covers for easy washing, though for some (like the Honeydew Scrumptious) you'll have to manually remove the filling and store it in a bag, while others like the Purple have a separated cover and fill section. How Does WIRED Choose Pillows to Review? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We research all pillows we test to make sure we test a variety of styles, fills, and shapes to find which are the most supportive over a night's sleep. We test both expensive and affordably priced models to see how the quality stacks up, and usually look to test new designs and options to see what's coming next (and every other category we test for). We also check out reviews and customer feedback when available to see if it's worth testing to compare against pillows we know we already like. How Does WIRED Test Pillows? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Every pillow in this guide is slept on for a minimum of three nights, with our top picks getting at least a week if not closer to a month of sleep testing from either myself, other staffers, or long-term testers. I also hosted a testing panel in March 2025 with six participants and 22 different models. The panelists all had different sleep styles ranging from classic side and back sleepers to chaotic sleepers who end up underneath their pillows every night, and the panel judged which options they found most comfortable and would be most likely to buy for their sleep needs. How Does WIRED Acquire Pillows? What Happens to the Review Units After Testing? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Most of our pillows are provided by the company for us to review, sometimes by that company reaching out to offer its newest model for us to consider, or more frequently, us reaching out and asking to test it after researching that specific style or fill type. We also purchase some pillows for ourselves and will write about them. After we test pillows, they're either placed with a long-term tester if the model is a pick, or they're donated.

A ban came and went in December, but the court lifted its stay, so the new watches are once again banned from the US if they have the disputed blood oxygen technology. Apple has announced that new versions of the Series 9 and Ultra 2 without those features will go on sale in the morning on Thursday, January 18th.

The move came in response to an import ban handed down by the US International Trade Commission, which ruled in October that Apple infringed on patents for pulse oximetry tech made by Masimo, a medical device maker. This would mean Apple can no longer import and sell its newest Apple Watch models in the US.

You’re in good company, as many of the WIRED Reviews team are also side sleepers. So are most Americans. The numbers vary across studies and depend on how rigidly you define “side sleeper,” but between half and three-quarters of people sleep on their side for at least part of the night.

If you're a side sleeper, you know how crucial it is that your bed keeps your back aligned while the hips and shoulders get some cushioning. Otherwise, it's a disaster. Without enough lumbar support, your middle is sinking in way farther than the rest of your body. Meanwhile, the hips and shoulders get that much more strain placed on them, especially if the bed is not forthcoming with pressure relief. It doesn't paint a cozy picture, which is why we side sleepers want something that accomplishes the lumbar support, pressure relief, and comfortability trifecta.

Many of our testers side-sleep and can speak to the necessity of these mattress performance factors firsthand, including Reviews team director Martin Cizmar and sleep writer Julia Forbes, a certified sleep science coach. It's never so simple as just lying down on a bed and saying “Eureka!” That's why we spend at least a week with each bed to monitor our daily sleep and feelings toward each one. We as a team have collectively spent years testing hundreds of beds. Of those hundreds of options, we whittled it down to our 10 that we wholeheartedly can say are the best mattresses for side sleepers.

Be sure to check out our other sleep guides, including Best Mattresses, Best Organic Mattresses, and the Best Body Pillows for Side Sleepers.

Wednesday

After spending the summer honing her psychic powers by tracking down serial killers, Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) returns to Nevermore Academy—but this school year is more of an Addams Family reunion. With her mother, Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), drawn into an onsite committee role by suspicious new principal Barry Dort (Steve Buscemi), brother Pugsley (Isaac Ordonez) joining the school after developing electric powers, and eccentric Grandmama (Joanna Lumley) turning up, Wednesday barely has a chance to investigate a new string of murders or a conspiracy surrounding a shady psychiatric hospital. The perils of the show’s protracted three-year gap between seasons is hard to overlook in places—Pugsley now towers over Wednesday, explained as a growth spurt, and you’ll almost certainly need to rewatch the first season to remember what’s going on—but this is a welcome return for Netflix’s spooky, ooky teen drama.

Love, Death + Robots

Developed by Deadpool director Tim Miller, Love, Death + Robots is one of Netflix’s most exciting animated offerings—an anthology series where the only common thread is each episode’s unique interpretation of that eponymous trio of themes. Now in its fourth season, viewers are treated to wild concepts that include psychic street gangs in a postapocalyptic future (400 Boys), a re-creation of the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Live at Slane Castle performance of “Can’t Stop” in marionette form (directed by David Fincher, no less), and, in a rare hybrid of live action and CGI, a priest (played by Rhys Darby) meeting an alien envoy that thinks God has been reborn as an Earth dolphin. Wildly experimental, Love, Death + Robots constantly juggles animation styles and genres and practically vibrates off the screen with sheer visual energy. You never know what you’re going to get with this show—and that’s half the fun.

Sneaky Pete

Just released from prison, Marius (Giovanni Ribisi) steals the identity of former cellmate Pete Murphy in order to hide from the dangers of his old life. On the run from a vicious gangster played by Bryan Cranston (who also jointly created the show), Marius nestles in with Pete’s motley crew of estranged family. They're delighted to be reunited with their long-lost relative, but he finds taking over another man’s life might be even more dangerous than the past he’s running from. Originally an Amazon Prime series, this three-season drama can now be binged in its entirety on Netflix.

Grace and Frankie

The brainchild of Friends cocreator Marta Kauffman, this sharp sitcom sees Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin as the titular Grace and Frankie, longtime acquaintances forced into living together after their husbands leave them late in life—for each other. The show follows this contemporary odd couple as they deal with their ex-husbands' coming out, their adult children's drama, and each other's maddening personalities, all while building a genuine friendship and trying to prove to themselves and the world that age is just a number. Taking cues from Arrested Development, Grace and Frankie's chief comedic currency is awkwardness, as their two extended families—the rich, business-minded Hansons and the borderline hippy Bergsteins—bring their neuroses and baggage to bear while navigating adult familial relationships. Think of it as a modern-day Golden Girls—just with more swearing and drug use.

Sakamoto Days

Taro Sakamoto used to be the worst of the worst, a hitman par excellence, his lethal skills making him a legendary figure in the criminal underworld. Then he fell in love, got married, and retired to run a convenience store with his wife Aoi and their daughter Hana. Unfortunately, he didn't exactly leave his old job on the best of terms, and now a cadre of killers are out for the billion yen bounty on his head. Luckily, Sakamoto's lost none of his skills—even though he's let himself go in other areas—but can he protect his family without breaking Aoi's strict ""no killing"" rule? Based on the manga by Yuto Suzuki, this comedy action anime is a blast. Now into its second season, with new episodes dropping each Monday, it's appointment viewing you won't want to miss.

Sweet Tooth

Based on the comic book by Jeff Lemire, Sweet Tooth kicks off 10 years after “The Sick,” a viral pandemic that killed most of the population and led—somehow—to babies being born with part-human, part-animal characteristics. The series follows Gus (Christian Convery), a half-deer hybrid boy who leaves the wilderness in search of his mother, and “Big Man” Tommy Jeppard (Nonso Anozie), a grizzled traveler who becomes his reluctant guide, protecting him from surviving humans who hate and fear the hybrids. Over the course of three seasons, Gus and Jeppard are drawn into conflict with scientist Aditya Singh (Adeel Akhtar), whose research into the origins of The Sick sees him take on an almost religious obsession with Gus, all while tensions mount between the increasingly diverged species of humans and hybrids. Part sci-fi, part fantasy, part mystery, Sweet Tooth offers viewers a postapocalyptic dystopia unlike any other.

Squid Game

The Korean sensation that became a global phenomenon, Squid Game’s blend of Hunger Games’ shocking elimination battles and Parasite’s condemnation of exploitative capitalism turned it into one of Netflix's biggest-ever hits. It started off simply enough—hundreds of desperate people recruited to compete in a series of playground games with a deadly twist, the survivor winning a ₩45.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot. But now, with its third and final season, the stakes are higher than ever, and even perennial survivor Seong Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae) might not be able to win this round. Intense, brutal, and frequently graphic, Squid Game remains gripping to the very end.

Trainwreck

Little else is as fascinating as a real-life disaster born of sheer hubris. The strange mix of “saw that one coming” and “get the popcorn,” as you watch events unfold makes for captivating viewing. That's the special sauce for Trainwreck, Netflix's series of documentaries exploring some of the biggest, well, train wrecks of recent history. From the crack-cocaine-fueled tenure of Toronto's disgraced mayor Rob Ford to the avoidable errors that saw a luxury cruise liner turned into an infamous “poop cruise,” each installment is a fascinating exploration of how badly things can go wrong when the wrong people are in charge. Netflix oddly categorizes each Trainwreck as its own movie, but it's really a loosely connected anthology, and while some cases require their own multi-episode arcs to excavate the wreckage (shoutout to Woodstock ’99), there's no particular starting point—simply pick your favorite screw-up and just try to look away.

The Survivors

Years ago, Kieran Elliott (Charlie Vickers) survived a storm that trapped him in a sea cave, but his brother Finn and friend Toby died in the rescue attempt. Fifteen years later, he returns to his hometown with his partner Mia (Yerin Ha) and their baby Audrey for a memorial, finding that everyone from neighbors to his own mother still blame him for the tragedy. While those deaths still haunt the small town community, they may also have obscured another tragedy—teenager Gabby Birch went missing the same night. Now, out-of-town investigator Bronte (Shannon Berry), the only person who still cared about the long-cold case, has wound up dead herself, and everyone in Kieran's life seems to be connected. Adapted from the novel by Jane Harper, this Australian murder mystery from Glitch creator Tony Ayres is a darkly compelling miniseries.

Glitch

To those in the northern hemisphere, this Australian supernatural drama might be one of the best-kept secrets of the past decade. Centered on a small town in Victoria, an entire community is shaken when seven people rise from their graves, seemingly in perfect health but with no memory of who they are or how they died. As police sergeant James Hayes (Patrick Brammall) and local doctor Elishia McKellar (Genevieve O'Reilly) try to contain and examine “The Risen,” Hayes’ world is rocked when he learns his own late wife Kate is among them. Over the course of three seasons and 18 episodes, the reasons for the dead's return is teased out, starting with simply “how” and “why” but building up to something that questions the rules of reality. A fantastic ensemble cast and brilliant pacing make this a must-see.

Dept. Q

Edinburgh police detective Carl Morck (The Crown's Matthew Goode) used to be one of the best—until his arrogance got his partner paralyzed and a uniformed officer killed, and saw him narrowly survive a bullet through his own neck. After returning to work following a lengthy period of mandatory leave, Morck finds himself heading up the new Department Q—an underfunded, under-staffed operation in the precinct's dank basement, dedicated to solving the iciest of cold cases. Gathering a team of misfits, including Rose (Leah Byrne), eager to please but recovering from a breakdown, Akram (Alexej Manvelov), a Syrian refugee, and Morck's still-bedbound partner James (Jamie Sives), the department has a lot to prove—but solving the disappearance of Merritt Linguard (Chloe Pirrie) might be a good start. Based on the novels by Danish author Jussi Adler-Olsen, Dept. Q is a brilliant blend of Scandi noir and gritty British crime drama.

Sirens

First The White Lotus, then The Perfect Couple, and now Sirens—Meghann Fahy is making a career out of starring in shows where we get to see awfully rich people doing awfully bad things to each other. Here, she plays down-on-her-luck Devon, drawn into the luxurious world her sister Simone (Milly Alcock, imminently Supergirl) inhabits by proxy, working as an assistant to billionaire's wife Michaela (Julianne Moore). It's never clear how willingly Simone got involved with the charismatic Michaela, who may be a mentor or cult leader or something else entirely, nor how overprotective or paranoid Devon is, but the hook of this glossy, dark comedy is in finding out.

The Eternaut

Juan Salvo (Ricardo Darín) was settling in for a card game with his friends. Then the snow started falling—unusual enough for Buenos Aires in the summer, and downright terrifying when everyone touched by the freak weather event drops dead. But as Salvo desperately tries to find his daughter and ex-wife among the few survivors, an even deeper horror emerges. Adapted from a beloved Argentinian comic book by Héctor Germán Oesterheld and Francisco Solano López, The Eternaut offers a unique piece of postapocalyptic drama, focusing on grounded, authentic characters before spinning off into wilder sci-fi directions.

Blood of Zeus

This adult animated take on Greek mythology returns for its third and final season, bringing the odyssey of demigod Heron—son of Zeus and mortal woman Electra—to a brutal conclusion. After years of manipulation, power plays, and betrayals, the season picks up with the Olympian gods and their Titan predecessors lined up against each other, the fate of the world hanging on the outcome of the ultimate family feud. Heron and his estranged brother Seraphim may be the only ones able to bring peace—so it's rather inconvenient that Heron is dead. From start to finish, Blood of Zeus has impressed with smart writing that offers compelling twists on the classic myths, all brought to life with top-tier animation and phenomenal voice acting, and it doesn't disappoint as it reaches its finale. One of Netflix's best animated series.

You

Based on the novels of Caroline Kepnes, You is an often deeply disturbing series. During the first season, bookstore manager Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) falls in deranged-love-at-first-sight with aspiring author Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail). In subsequent ones, he relocates to Los Angeles, where heiress Love Quinn (Victoria Pedretti) became the focus of his attention, and then to London, where he poses as an unassuming university professor before meeting his match in Kate Galvin (Charlotte Ritchie). At each turn, the globe-hopping saga of murderous obsession has become more and more unsettling. In the fifth and final season, Joe returns to New York with his new wife, Kate, but the darkness and brutality that's followed him around the world is never far behind. Often shocking, You is a gripping thriller that hits the same sinister sweet spot as early (read: good) seasons of Dexter.

The Four Seasons

Three couples—lovebirds Kate and Jack (Tina Fey and Will Forte), glamorous Danny and Claude (Colman Domingo and Marco Calvani), and fraying Nick and Anne (Steve Carrell and Kerri Kenney-Silver)—have known each other since college, maintaining their decades-long friendship with a series of regular vacations together. But when Nick finally splits with Anne—who was about to surprise him with a vow renewal—the group's dynamic completely changes. It sounds like the premise for a depressing drama, but The Four Seasons is instead a surprisingly life-affirming comedy, bolstered by fantastic performances across-the-board. A loose adaptation of the 1981 movie of the same name, this eight-episode miniseries—cocreated by Fey—sometimes takes things in more farcical, physical comedy directions, but maintains a charming sense of warmth and humanity throughout.

Black Mirror

Black Mirror returns with six new episodes that continue to explore humanity’s complicated relationship with technology. Although the new, seventh season includes a couple of rare sequels to previous Black Mirror episodes, the anthology format means every episode remains accessible. That means you can jump right in with the heartbreaking “Eulogy,” where Paul Giamatti's Phillip dives through his own fractured memories of a lost lover. Or you can start with the sinister “Plaything,” in which a gaming journalist gets murderously obsessed with a strange life-sim game, partly inspired by series creator Charlie Brooker’s own background. (In a very meta twist, you can play the game for real.) Whether you’re a longtime fan or this is your first encounter with poignant tech dystopias, all of Black Mirror awaits your viewing.

North of North

Young Inuk woman Siaja (Anna Lambe, True Detective: Night Country) married straight out of high school, then spent years trapped in the shadow of her shallow, selfish husband, Ting—the golden boy of their small town of Ice Cove, nestled far in the Arctic Circle. A brush with death—and possibly the goddess Nuliajuk—gives her the push to make a fresh start, but an explosive breakup in a community of only 2,000 people means Siaja’s personal life is now everyone’s business. Netflix’s first Canadian original series, this sharp sitcom is packed with warmth and humor, while its on-location shooting in Iqaluit (the real-life capital of the Arctic Canadian territory of Nunavut) delivers breathtaking natural beauty along with the laughs.

Devil May Cry

Building on the success of Castlevania, Netflix’s take on Capcom’s Devil May Cry series continues the streamer’s strong track record of animated video game adaptations. For those who've never picked up a controller, the series follows half-demon devil hunter Dante, a stylish slayer with a penchant for slicing up hell's worst offenders. This eight-episode spectacular sees Dante (voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch) clashing with the horrific White Rabbit (Hoon Lee), a twisted monster aiming to tear down the barrier between Earth and hell. Animation fans will also appreciate one of the final performances from the venerable, sadly-passed Kevin Conroy as the villainous US Vice President Baines. Devil May Cry may be unashamedly in love with its own early 2000s origins—as evidenced by a soundtrack filled with songs from the likes of Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach—but this slickly animated action masterpiece is a hellishly good time.

Adolescence

A quiet English town. 6 am. Police raid the house of Jamie Miller on suspicion of murdering an innocent girl. Jamie is 13 years old. A shocking mini-series, this isn't a whodunit, but a whydunit. Its four episodes—each masterfully shot in a single real-time take—explore how boys are radicalized online to hate women, and the horrifying effects it has. The powerhouse cast includes cocreator and writer Stephen Graham (Bodies, A Thousand Blows) as Jamie's father Eddie, Ashley Walters (Bulletproof) as Detective Boscombe, the arresting officer and investigator of Jamie's crime, and Erin Doherty (The Crown) as the psychologist evaluating Jamie. Each brings this incredibly difficult material to life, but it's newcomer Owen Cooper as Jamie who most astounds, turning from petrified to cheeky to vitriolic in a terrifying heartbeat. Adolescence is harrowing but important viewing.

Pantheon

Originally an AMC+ show, both seasons of Pantheon are now available on Netflix. Good timing too, since its nightmarish scenario of digitally uploaded human consciousnesses and exploration of the impact such technology would have on society feels worryingly prescient. With plot threads weaving between isolated Maddie Kim, whose dead father may have been reborn as an “Uploaded Intelligence,” Caspian Keyes, a genius teenager whose entire life is a Truman Show–style lie, and Vinod Chanda, an engineer investigating UI, this hard sci-fi outing—based on the short fiction of Ken Liu—offers a dark examination of virtual immortality. A uniquely brilliant adult animated series.

Zero Day

Cards on the table: A significant part of the appeal here is seeing the iconic Robert De Niro in his first major English-language TV role (he previously appeared in the Argentinian Nada, aka Nothing). He doesn't disappoint with his performance as former US president George Mullen—pulled out of retirement to oversee a commission investigating a colossal cyberattack that left thousands of Americans dead and the terrifying warning that ""this will happen again""—commanding the screen with his trademark gravitas. Director Lesli Linka Glatter wrings great drama from the whodunit of it all (Russians? hackers? hedge fund bros?), but with Mullen handed unprecedented powers to track down the culprits, the real nail-biting moments come from its suddenly timely explorations of abuses of power. With a powerhouse cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lizzy Caplan, and Jesse Plemons, Zero Day is an engaging political thriller, and at six episodes it makes for a great binge-watch.

Apple Cider Vinegar

Influencers have been known to hawk nonsense diets and spurious “wellness” regimens, but few have ever done it like Belle Gibson, the real-life Australian influencer who went as far as faking brain cancer for attention. And while she hailed alternative diets and whole foods for keeping her nonexistent illness at bay—launching an app and cookbook in the process—actual cancer sufferers paid the price for her extreme narcissism and greed. This dramatized limited series—“a true-ish story … based on a lie,” as Netflix puts it—makes for uncomfortably gripping viewing as it charts the rise and fall of Gibson (Kaitlyn Dever, with a flawless Aussie accent) and her rivalry with Milla Blake (Alycia Debnam-Cary), a fellow influencer and actual cancer patient. Better than doomscrolling reels on Instagram or TikTok, and a reminder that everyone should be a lot more skeptical of anything influencers are shilling on social media.

The Night Agent

Special agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) is back, and the stakes have never been higher. While the first season of The Night Agent wove a compelling spy drama out of the idea of a mole at the heart of America's intelligence services, the newly arrived second season takes a more global approach—Sutherland hunts down a stolen chemical weapon project, drawing him back into the orbit of tech savant and sometime love interest Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), while Iranian diplomatic aide Noor Taheri (Arienne Mandi) offers secrets to the CIA in return for asylum, and a deposed Eastern European dictator aims to manipulate everything from behind bars. Sure, the show’s mix of politics and spook work won’t surprise genre diehards, but it weaves together its many influences—and many more plot threads—into a supremely entertaining thriller.

Asura

The four Takezawa sisters are close but have little in common. Eldest Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is already a widow; repressed Takiko (Yû Aoi) and rebellious Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) are always at each other's throats; and second-born Makiko (Machiko Ono) tries to balance keeping the peace with being a housewife and mother to her own two children. Yet when Takiko learns that their father Kotaro (Jun Kunimura) may have a second, secret, family, the sisters’ bonds are put to the test as they struggle to uncover the truth. Asura is far more than a turgid family drama—it's equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, capturing the complexities of the relationships between its quartet of protagonists. Keeping the 1970s setting of Kuniko Mukōda’s original novel allows Palme d’Or– winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) to craft a gorgeously shot period piece that still feels incredibly timely and modern.

Jentry Chau vs the Underworld

You know the drill—everyday teenager learns she has superpowers and is destined to fight the forces of darkness. Except Jentry Chau (voiced by Ali Wong) is not like any other teenage girl—she’s known about the supernatural her whole life (her uncontrollable fire powers were a giveaway) and spent a lifetime avoiding it. Sent to study in Korea for her own safety, Jentry is drawn back into the mystic world after being attacked in Seoul by a jiangshi named Ed (Bowen Yang). Brought back to her home in Texas by her great-aunt, Jentry has to survive not only the formidable mogui Mr. Cheng, who intends to drain her soul and powers, but the horrors of high school, culture shock, and the pain of her own past. Taking the “high school is hell” metaphor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, adding a dash of Gravity Falls’ mystery, and rooting it all in Asian mythology, Jentry Chau vs the Underworld is one of Netflix’s freshest animated shows in years.

No Good Deed

Take Selling Sunset and add a grisly tragicomic twist and you just about have No Good Deed. A dark comedy from Liz Feldman, creator of Dead to Me, this eight-part series starts with Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano) putting their gorgeous home on the market, and descends into darker territory as prospective buyers go to ever more desperate attempts to get their hands on the house, nosy neighbors interfere, and the grisly history of the house itself threatens to come to light. Buoyed by a stellar cast including Teyonah Parris, Abbi Jacobson, Luke Wilson, and Denis Leary, this is a glossy, witty, and possibly only slightly exaggerated take on the brutality of the Los Angeles property market.

A Man on the Inside

The latest show from comedy mastermind Michael Schur (The Good Place, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine), A Man on the Inside features Ted Danson as Charles Nieuwendyk, a retired engineering professor who's lost all direction since his wife passed. But when private investigator Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) needs a man of his demographic to go undercover in a retirement community to investigate allegations of resident abuse, Charles may find an unlikely new lease on life—if he can figure out how to use his smartphone, that is. Reflecting on end-of-life realities as much as it plays up Charles' fish-out-of-water situation, it's a show that's equal parts poignant, melancholic, and achingly funny—and it's based on a true story, to boot.

Black Doves

Helen Webb (Keira Knightley) is wife to the UK defense secretary, mother to two children, and bored with her picture-perfect life. Spectacular cover then, since she's actually a spy for the mercenary organization Black Doves, selling state secrets to the highest bidder. But when her real love Jason (Andrew Koji) is killed, Helen is determined to find out who killed him and why—and her pursuit of the truth threatens both her public and private lives. Paired with assassin and old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw, in a very different spy role to his turn in the James Bond films) at the behest of stern operator Mrs. Reed (Sarah Lancashire), Helen's obsession could have led to a dour, gritty thriller, but Black Doves bucks the grim-dark trend to serve up a pulpy, colorful outing with enough heart to balance its violence. At only six episodes (with a second season already confirmed), it's a brisk watch too.

Arcane

Animated series based on video games can run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. Yet Arcane stood out by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between is entirely accessible. The second and final season, released in a trio of movie-length blocks of three episodes apiece, escalates the conflict between the warring factions but never loses its central focus on the fractured relationship between sisters. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane is one of the best animated series in years—and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it.

Cobra Kai

Picking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence’s iconic fight at the end of the first Karate Kid movie, Cobra Kai initially follows a washed-up Johnny as he reopens the Cobra Kai karate dojo, finding new purpose after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridueña, Blue Beetle) in a fight. Over the course of six seasons, the stakes get higher—and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous—as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California. Alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity, and everything gears toward a global battle for karate supremacy. It’s all a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, it’s a retro-styled delight.

Heartstopper

One of the most joyful shows on Netflix returns for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt queer romance. In the long-awaited third season, things heat up between the central couple, with Charlie (Joe Locke) preparing to say three little words to Nick (Kit Connor) for the first time, while Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao (William Gao) try to have the perfect romantic summer before Elle starts art college. Heartstopper's return also sheds some of its earlier cloying tendencies, growing up alongside its talented young cast and giving them more serious material to work with, tackling more mature themes of sex, eating disorders, and gender dysphoria—all without losing the warmth and charm that made audiences fall in love with the show in the first place. The show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and one that everyone needs to watch, whatever their sexuality.

The Boyfriend

""Anyone can fall in love with anyone"" is the opening narration to The Boyfriend, Japan's first same-sex dating show—a bold and progressive statement that reflects the shifting tide of opinion in the country. Throwing nine single men together in an idyllic beach house for a summer and charging them with running a coffee truck, the over-arching concept is to see who'll pair up, but the series is as interested in exploring the friendships that emerge between the cast as it is the romantic relationships. Unlike Western dating shows, there are no scandals, no dramatic twists, no betrayals, and the “challenges” are adorably focused on confessing feelings. The gentleness of it all adds an almost relaxing quality, with the men discussing their emotions—and the nature of being queer in Japan—earnestly. An absolutely joyful example of reality TV.

Kleo

If you’re pining for more Killing Eve, then this German thriller may be the next best thing. Set in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the series follows the eponymous Kleo (Jella Haase), a Stasi assassin imprisoned by her agency on false treason charges. Released after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she seeks revenge on her former handlers—but West German detective Sven (Dimitrij Schaad), the only witness to her last kill, may have something to say about that. As dark and violent as you'd expect given the period and the themes of betrayal and vengeance, Kleo is lightened by its oft-deranged sense of humor and a charismatic lead duo who brilliantly bounce off one another—chemistry that's only heightened in the second season as Kleo's pursuit of her old allies intensifies, attracting attention from international spy agencies in the aftermath of the Cold War.

Sweet Home

Based on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times—rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people's transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season is a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building—chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-su (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster—battle for survival. The second and third seasons explore what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man—and if there's any hope for what remains of humanity. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd.

Star Trek Prodigy

Paramount+'s loss remains Netflix's gain, as the streamer's license rescue of this great Star Trek spin-off warps into its second season. After escaping a distant prison planet and becoming Starfleet cadets under the watchful eye of Star Trek Voyager's Admiral Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the ragtag crew—led by aspiring captain Dal R'El and bolstered by astrolinguist Gwyndala, engineer Jankom Pog, energy being Zero, scientist Rok-Tahk, and indestructible, gelatinous Murf—find themselves cast through time on the most dangerous mission of their young lives. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe and its ethics, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkers to appreciate, particularly with a slate of returning Star Trek legends voiced by their original actors. Prodigy is something of a sleeper hit, but one of the best Trek shows in years.

Supacell

One by one, five Black Londoners awaken to strange superpowers. Struggling father Andre (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) develops superstrength, nurse Sabrina (Nadine Mills) unleashes phenomenal telekinetic might, drug dealer Rodney (Calvin Demba) races at superspeed, and wannabe gang leader Tazer (Josh Tedeku) turns invisible. But it's Michael (Tosin Cole, Doctor Who) who may be the most pivotal, realizing he can leap through time and space and learning he only has three months to save his fiancée's life. Created by Andrew “Rapman” Onwubolu, Supacell is a show about superpowers, but not necessarily superheroes, with its fantastic cast offering up a far more realistic and human exploration of now-familiar ideas than anything you'll find in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And the mystery of why—and how—only Black people seem to be gaining powers builds up to a more powerful punch than an Asgardian god of thunder. A smart, modern, and refreshing take on the genre.

The Good Place

After suffering an improbable and humiliating death, Eleanor (Kristen Bell) finds herself in “The Good Place,” a perfect neighborhood inhabited by the world's worthiest people. The only problem? She's not meant to be there. Desperate to not be sent to “The Bad Place,” she tries to correct her behavior in the afterlife, with the help of her assigned soulmate, philosophy professor Chidi (William Jackson Harper). A twist at the end of the first season remains one of the best ever, while the show's ability to sprinkle ethical and philosophical precepts into a sitcom format is frankly astounding. With a sensational cast rounded out by Manny Jacinto, Jameela Jamil, D'Arcy Carden, and Ted Danson, The Good Place more than earns its place in the good place of TV history.

3 Body Problem

In 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world—and humanity’s continued existence may rely on there being no “game over.” Game of Thrones’ creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu’s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza González, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga.

Ripley

Perhaps best known nowadays from 1999’s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith’s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman’s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle—and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date.

Beef

Ever been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you’re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then—after a few deep breaths—Beef is the show for you. It's a pressure valve for every petty grievance you’ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller—it's a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates—as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series.

Loudermilk

Something of a sleeper hit for years—its first two seasons debuted on AT&T's now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon—all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life's small frustrations—a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It's dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier.

Scott Pilgrim Takes Off

Adapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker's battles against lover Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that's as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it—just watch.

Blue Eye Samurai

In the 17th Century, Japan enforced its ""sakoku"" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between—so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated—which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic—and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix.

Pending Train

Netflix: License one of Japan’s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in—Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn’t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers’ first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group—including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae—begins to realize that there may be a reason they’ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go.

One Piece

Mark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from “awful” to “not too bad,” Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans’ fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda’s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast Iñaki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season—including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)—all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking.

The Chosen One

Based on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life—and potentially the world—changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader—also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!)",,"Matt Kamen, Wired Staff, Angela Watercutter, Adam Morgan","47, season, life, netflixs, cast, shows, netflix, series, world, good, right, best",pending,2025-08-16T13:29:28.825839+00:00,2cbc0bed127ec2d5d949e3b69590c214aa272b45276a837a26d6ace845f7b5e9

Mononoke The Movie II: The Ashes of Rage

Set a month after the events of The Phantom in the Rain, the second in a planned trilogy finds the mysterious Medicine Seller returning to the Inner Chambers of the Imperial Palace in Edo-era Japan. While conditions for the emperor’s lower-ranking concubines have improved, prickly political machinations make things more dangerous than ever for the upper tier, including warring favorites Fuki and Botan—and that’s before a new supernatural terror raises its head. Another masterclass in tension and otherworldly horror, Mononoke maintains its stunning visual approach evoking watercolors on parchment, making for one of the most sumptuous and visually striking pieces of animation you’ll ever see.

Ziam

There’s a lot to recommend about Ziam, but the elevator pitch is just four words: Muay Thai versus zombies. The literal translation of the Thai title gives us four more: “Biting Mouth, Kicking Feet.” If that doesn’t make you want to watch this action-horror outing, seek help. Set in an already dystopian future where the climate crisis has melted the ice caps, former professional fighter Singh (Prin Suparat) is desperate to reunite with his girlfriend Rin (Nuttanicha Dungwattanawanich), a doctor in his hometown of Chiang Dao. Cue one zombie outbreak courtesy of the shady VS Corporation, and soon Singh is punching, kicking, and elbowing his way through hordes of ravenous undead, trying to evacuate Rin and a young patient from her hospital—before it’s blown up to contain the infection! Think Ong Bak meets Dawn of the Dead meets The Raid, and throw in some of the most horrifying zombie designs in years, and Ziam makes for a schlocky but thrilling time.

Happy Gilmore 2

Thirty years after graduating from ice hockey washout to golfing glory, Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is down on his luck again. After his wife died in a freak golf accident, he’s now a single dad of five, struggling to send his talented dancer daughter to a ballet school in Paris. His only hope to scrape together the money he needs is to get back into the game. The only thing standing in his way are old rivals and a nefarious CEO trying to revamp the entire sport for the worst. Despite being packed with nods to the original film, in both returning cast members and general tone—expect peak ’90s Sandler crassness in places—Happy Gilmore 2 is a raucously funny sports comedy that sees Sandler playing well above par again.

The Old Guard 2

It’s been a long five years since the original The Old Guard dropped on Netflix, adapting the graphic novels by Greg Rucka and Leandro Fernández into a budding franchise. Centered on a roving gang of immortals fronted by Charlize Theron as Andromache of Scythia—Andy to her friends—this long-gestating sequel expands on the lore, throwing her modern-day allies into a centuries-old grudge match against old flame Quỳnh (Veronica Ngô). Meanwhile the newest immortal Nile (KiKi Layne) comes face-to-face with the very first, Discord (Uma Thurman, absolutely vamping it in a villainous role and seemingly loving it). The Old Guard 2 sadly doesn’t reach the same exhilarating heights as the first film—at its worst, it’s choppily edited and lacks focus—but it’s an entertaining outing that further cements Theron as an action megastar.

Brick

When workaholic game developer Tim (Matthias Schweighöfer, Army of the Dead) and his partner Liv (Ruby O. Fee) break up, Liv finds it hard to walk away. Quite literally, as their apartment block has been mysteriously surrounded by an impenetrable wall. Left with no choice but to smash through walls and ceilings to find a way out, teaming with other residents trapped inside as they do, the group desperately searches for an escape route—but the strange barrier and the building itself seems set on stopping them. Reminiscent at times of cult classic Cube, this German-language sci-fi thriller (there's an English language dub, but it's truly terrible—stick with subtitles) is schlocky but satisfying entertainment.

Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl

Twenty years after their last feature-length outing, not-so-intrepid inventor Wallace and his long-suffering canine companion Gromit are back. When criminal penguin Feathers McGraw—last seen in the classic The Wrong Trousers—learns of Wallace's easily-hackable robotic garden gnome Norbot, the nefarious villain hatches a plan for revenge, one that tears the heroes' friendship apart and leads to the greatest chase scene tranquil Yorkshire has ever seen. Irrepressibly charming and relentlessly daft, this stop-motion-animated comedy from the geniuses at Aardman—the studio behind Chicken Run—is a pure delight.

KPop Demon Hunters

Three-part harmony group Huntr/x are at the top of their game. Not only are they the world's best-loved girl group, but in their secret side role as Earth's defenders against demonic forces, they're about to permanently seal away an ancient evil. Unfortunately, lead singer Rumi (Arden Cho) is hiding something from bandmates Mira (May Hong) and Zoey (Ji-young Yoo), and her dark secret may tear them apart right as they face their strongest foes—an evil boyband fronted by the devilishly handsome Jinu (Ahn Hyo-seop). Blending the pastel-pop of Jem and the Holograms, the monster-slaying action of Buffy, and enough K-pop earworms to make Blackpink blink, Kpop Demon Hunters is a perfect summer movie for kids and families, a brilliantly animated adventure that's as fresh and memorable as its energetic musical numbers.

Always Be My Maybe

Written by and starring Ali Wong and Randall Park, Always Be My Maybe tells the story of two inseparable childhood friends whose lives veer dramatically apart after a grief-stricken rendezvous in their teenage years. Wong plays Sasha Tran, a superstar chef whose stratospheric career barely papers over the cracks in her faltering relationship. Park, meanwhile, plays Marcus Kim, whose ambitions have taken him no further than the local dive bar and his father's air conditioning firm. Fate—and a bizarre cameo from Keanu Reeves—conspire to bring the two leads back together in a film that at long last lifts Asian Americans outside of Hollywood's clichéd casting and into a thoughtful and hilarious romantic comedy.

Our Times

In 1966, husband and wife physicists Nora (Lucero) and Héctor (Benny Ibarra) are equal partners at the University of Mexico, even though their colleagues see Nora as little more than Héctor's lab assistant. Then they crack the secret of time travel, catapulting themselves forward to 2025—and strand themselves here. While both marvel at the leaps humanity has made in half a century, Nora is delighted to be reunited with her former protégé Julia (Ofelia Medina), now dean of the university. But as Héctor finds himself desperate to return to the comfort and prestige he enjoyed in the past, the pair's relationship begins to fall apart. More rom-com than sci-fi, this is time-travel with a bittersweet touch.

Barbarian

When Tess (Georgina Campbell) finds her Airbnb in a sketchy neighborhood double-booked with Keith (Bill Skarsgård), you will probably think you know where Barbarian is headed. You don't—and you should brace yourself for everything that follows. Written and directed by Zach Cregger (in a seismic departure from his comedy background), Barbarian constantly shifts, playing with—and regularly subverting—viewer expectations of horror movie clichés at every turn. Smartly written, brilliantly shot, and psychologically disturbing on multiple levels, Barbarian is a genuinely terrifying entry in the modern horror canon.

Lost in Starlight

Dr. Nan-young Joo is desperate to follow in her late astronaut mother's footsteps and make it all the way to Mars. Jay is a slacker part-timer, loosely aspiring to be a musician. In this Korean animated movie from director Han Ji-won, they become a pair of literally star-crossed lovers, linked by a love of music. While the sci-fi aspect of it all makes for some spectacular visuals, from the futuristic-but-plausible view of Seoul in 2051, to truly cosmic, almost psychedelic, sequences as Nan-young ventures into space, the story's heart lies in the quieter, meaningful moments between its leads. Absolutely exquisite.

Kill Boksoon

To her friends, Gil Bok-soon (Jeon Do-yeon) is a successful events executive and dedicated single mother to her daughter Jae-yeong (Kim Si-a). In reality, she's the star performer at MK Ent—an assassination bureau, where her almost superhuman ability to predict every step in a critical situation has earned her a 100 percent success rate and a legendary reputation. The only problem: She's considering retiring at the end of her contract, a decision that opens her to threats from disgruntled enemies and ambitious colleagues alike. While its title and premise not-so-subtly evokes Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, director Byun Sung-hyun takes this Korean action epic to giddy heights with some of the most impressive fights committed to screen since, well, Kill Bill.

Mary and the Witch’s Flower

When Mary Smith moves to her great aunt’s estate in rural England, she finds herself unspeakably bored—until she finds a rare flower that blooms only once every seven years, coveted by witches for its magical properties. Soon, she's transported to Endor College, an academy for witches hidden in the clouds—but the warm welcome she receives from the fanciful faculty hides sinister secrets, and a dark ambition on the part of headmistress Madam Mumblechook that puts Mary's only friend, Peter, in danger. Adapted from Mary Stewart's novel The Little Broomstick and directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi (Arrietty, When Marnie Was There), Mary and the Witch’s Flower is a wonderful piece of family viewing, thrilling for kids with enough complexity for older viewers, and gorgeously animated from start to finish.

Bullet Train Explosion

Kazuya Takaichi (Tsuyoshi Kusanagi) is conductor of the Hayabusa 60 shinkansen, zooming from Shin-Aomori to Tokyo. A perfectly normal job—until a terrorist reveals a bomb onboard, which will explode if the train slows below 100 kmph. As authorities race to stop the attacker and rescue the passengers, Kazuya is forced to keep everyone onboard safe. What's that? It's just Speed on a Japanese train? Nah, Speed was just the original 1975 The Bullet Train on an American bus—and this modern-day version is equal parts remake and sequel to that Sonny Chiba-starring classic. It's more than an entertaining action thriller, though—director Shinji Higuchi relishes the opportunity to poke fun at point-scoring politicians crippled by bureaucratic process in responding to the crisis (no surprise to anyone who's seen 2016's Shin Godzilla, which he codirected with Hideaki Anno). High-speed, literally explosive action, with a satirical edge, Bullet Train Explosion is a blast (sorry).

Behind the Curtain: Stranger Things the First Shadow

If there's a Stranger Things–shaped hole in your life thanks to the approximate 4,738-year wait between seasons, this behind-the-scenes documentary focused on production of the West End stage show The First Shadow might go some way to filling it. While the film doesn't give the whole production away—itself a prequel, set in 1959 and exploring how the sleepy town of Hawkins became ground zero for all things spooky—it's a fascinating look at the technical wizardry that went into bringing the show to life and how director Stephen Daldry (Billy Elliott, Netflix's The Crown) and legendary theater producer Sonia Friedman worked with the Duffer Brothers to root everything in the lore and history of the series.

The Imaginary

This gorgeously animated take on the concept of imaginary friends is a whimsical fable full of stunning visuals and big ideas. Adapted from the book by A. F. Harrold, The Imaginary follows young Amanda and her best friend Rudger—brought into being by her own mind—as they share countless adventures. But as Amanda ages, Rudger faces the fate of all Imaginaries: fading away as their humans forget them. The latest film from director Yoshiyuki Momose (Mary and the Witch’s Flower) and Studio Ponoc—spiritual successor to the mighty Studio Ghibli—this is a stunning ode to the power of imagination and friendship.

Dead Talents Society

When keeping the living terrified is the economy of the afterlife, death becomes a literal capitalist hellhole. Dead Talents Society sees warring ""ghostresses"" Catherine (Sandrine Pinna) and her former protégé Jessica (Eleven Yao) battling for glamour and prestige in the great beyond by innovating new ways of scaring mortals, while a newcomer known only as Rookie (Gingle Wang) struggles to make her mark with any scares at all—and risks fading away entirely if she can't earn her undead keep. A sharply satirical horror comedy poking fun at everything from reality TV to hustle culture, this Taiwanese outing from writer-director John Hsu beats Beetlejuice at its own game.

Leave the World Behind

A weekend getaway at a luxury vacation rental property for Amanda and Clay and their kids, Archie and Rose, takes a sinister turn in the wake of an inexplicable blackout. When the house's owner, George, and his daughter Ruth return early, suspicions mount—but a growing herd of deer lurking outside the house, failing vehicles, and scattered reports of attacks across the US force the two families to rely on each other in the face of what may be the end of the world. Adapted from the novel of same name by Rumaan Alam, and with a star-studded cast including Julia Roberts, Mahershala Ali, Ethan Hawke, Myha'la, and Kevin Bacon, this relishes in keeping the audiences as uncertain as its characters, explaining little, and leaving questions you'll be mulling for days.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

Miles Morales’ (Shameik Moore) growth as Spider-Man continues in this phenomenal sequel to the Academy Award–winning Into the Spider-Verse—but this time, the web-slinger's neighborhood is a lot bigger and a lot less friendly. Introduced to a multiversal “Spider Society” led by the imposing Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac), Miles finds he's the only Spider-Man not invited—and that an unavoidable tragedy lies in his future. Even more visually ambitious than its predecessor, with each alternate reality—and the heroes that call them home, including Gwen Stacey Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Man India (Karan Soni), and Spider-Punk (Daniel Kaluuya)—brought to life with distinctive design and animation styles, Across the Spider-Verse is an almost unspeakably ambitious outing. It's also one that balances sheer spectacle with darker, more emotional conflicts for Miles, offering neither him nor viewers any easy answers. A film so brilliant that the wait for the upcoming third installment, Beyond the Spider-Verse, becomes increasingly painful with every passing day.

Troll

This gleefully entertaining giant monster movie abandons tearing up Tokyo or New York in favor of director Roar Uthaug’s (2018's Tomb Raider) native Norway, with a titanic troll stomping its way toward Oslo after being roused by a drilling operation. Although the plot and characters will be familiar to any fan of kaiju cinema, the striking Nordic visuals and the titular menace’s ability to blend in with the landscape, allows for some impressively original twists along the way. Although Troll could have easily descended into near-parody, Uthaug steers clear of smug self-awareness and instead delivers, and with a sequel arriving later in 2025, now is the perfect time to revisit one of the freshest takes on the genre in years.

Y Tu Mamá También

It's uncommon to find much in the way of classic films on Netflix—the algorithm must ever be fed by the churn of the new—so the availability of Alfonso Cuarón's brilliant 2001 coming-of-age movie is a real delight. Set in Mexico in 1999, Y Tu Mamá También (“And your mother, too”) follows rich kid Tenoch (Diego Luna) and his working-class friend Julio (Gael García Bernal) on a road trip with Luisa (Maribel Verdú), the wife of Tenoch’s cousin. It's a journey that sees the young men—still boys, really—competing for attention from the beautiful older woman, trapping themselves in lies and trying to get by on unearned confidence, all while claiming to be heading to a picture-perfect beach that they made up. As for why the much more mature and experienced Luisa would go along with them in the first place? Pack tissues. While the film courted controversy for its frank depiction of sex and drugs (it's not one for family film night), it remains a masterpiece; a raucous and all-too-real examination of young friendships and fragile masculinity.

Parasite

Director Bong Joon-ho's searing 2019 thriller is the first non-English film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and it's abundantly clear why. Its bleak exploration of economic disparity and condemnation of capitalistic excess is focused on its South Korea setting, but it resonates with global audiences. Parasite follows the struggling Kim family as they each infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Parks, posing as household servants to live a life of proximate luxury before their deception spirals wildly out of control. Somehow, it's also darkly comedic, mocking the obliviousness of the rich classes, both to their own privileges and to the desperation of the poor. Throughout, it's exquisitely shot and expertly paced, with Bong deftly increasing the tension with every scene until everything approaches a seemingly inevitable conclusion—and then still manages to twist and subvert audience expectations. A spectacular piece of filmmaking that deserves the hype, this examination of class and inequality feels more relevant than ever.

Carry-On

Is a movie set at Christmas in itself a Christmas movie? That debate has surged around Die Hard for decades. Now Carry-On asks the same question. A zippy thriller from House of Wax and Black Adam director Jaume Collet-Serra, this sees TSA agent Ethan Kopek (Taron Egerton) caught in the Christmas Eve shift from hell when he’s blackmailed by a mercenary known only as the Traveler (Jason Bateman) into allowing a deadly package through security. Cue a lethal game of cat-and-mouse as Ethan tries to stop the Traveler—all with the life of Ethan’s girlfriend Nora (Sofia Carson) in the balance. It’s pulpy and schlocky in places, but this throwback action outing can’t help but entertain.

Joy

In vitro fertilization may seem like a relatively mundane medical procedure nowadays, one that's brought hope and family to countless people struggling to conceive, but when the procedure was developed by a trio of British scientists and medics in the 1960s and '70s, it was hugely controversial. That makes for powerful material for this dramatization, charting the work of nurse and embryologist Jean Purdy (Thomasin McKenzie), scientist Robert Edwards (James Norton), and surgeon Patrick Steptoe (Bill Nighy), even as they're demonized by the public, the UK government, and even—perhaps especially—the church. McKenzie in particular is brilliant as Purdy, torn by her own conflict of faith at being involved in the life-changing work, which also involved providing safe abortion care to women who needed it, and struggling to deal with the ostracizing she faces from her family and community as a result. A powerful and provocative drama, even now.

Woman of the Hour

A serial killer is cast as a bachelor on a dating game show, allowing him to size up his next potential victim right in front of the audience watching at home. That'd be a twisted setup for a slasher flick—but what's horrifying about Woman of the Hour is that it's based on the real-life case of Rodney Alcala, who was a contestant on The Dating Game in 1978 while in the midst of a string of murders. This dramatization isn't centered on the killer, though. In her directorial debut, Anna Kendrick focuses instead on Sheryl (played by Kendrick, based on the real life Cheryl Bradshaw), the one unfortunate enough to be matched with Alcala (Daniel Zovatto), and the women who reported or suspected the killer, only to be routinely ignored by authorities. A taut thriller that makes clear the real horror lies in how easily Acala eluded attention for so long.

Will & Harper

Will Ferrell likely needs no introduction, but as former head writer of Saturday Night Live, Harper Steele is more accustomed to life behind the camera. Joining the hit show in the same week back in 1995, the pair struck up a decades-long friendship—so when Harper wrote to tell Ferrell she was transitioning to live as a woman, it was a big change for them both. It also formed the basis for this beautiful, heartwarming, and often laugh-out-loud funny road trip documentary following the duo as they cross the US in an old Jeep Grand Wagoneer, reconnecting and learning what their friendship looks like now. It's awkward viewing at times—some of Ferrell's questions blur the line between bawdy and simply rude—but it's a raw and authentic journey for them both. Beyond the personal touches, Will & Harper is a timely view of what America looks like for a trans person right now, making it possibly one of the most important documentaries Netflix has produced.

His Three Daughters

As their father approaches the end of his life, sisters Rachel (Natasha Lyonne), Katie (Carrie Coon), and Christina (Elizabeth Olsen) are forced to reconnect while waiting for the inevitable. Bleak stuff, but also grounds for masterful performances from the lead trio, with Rachel having taken on the bulk of care for months, Katie casting imperious demands despite avoiding the situation, and new-agey Christina trying to keep the peace—despite being at a breaking point herself. This is almost a locked-room piece, the apartment trapping the women, forcing them to come to terms with not only their father's death but their own relationships with each other, all while Vincent (Jay O. Sanders) haunts them even before his passing. Death may loom over director Azazel Jacobs’ drama, but His Three Daughters ultimately proves oddly life-affirming.

Grave of the Fireflies

When Seita and his young sister Setsuko are orphaned in the wake of the fire-bombing of Kobe during the final days of World War II, the siblings are forced into terrible circumstances to survive. Stuck between abusive extended family and the sheer desperation of scavenging around the ruins of their destroyed hometown, it's a bleak existence—and also the basis for one of Studio Ghibli's finest works. Directed by Isao Takahata and based on a short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, Grave of the Fireflies is unapologetically harrowing in its exploration of how war and nationalism chew up the most vulnerable, yet peppered with moments of unwavering love as Seita attempts to protect Setsuko's innocence. This searing wartime drama is sobering but essential viewing, a film that's more than earned its ranking in the upper echelons of the Best Studio Ghibli films.

Rebel Ridge

When corrupt cops run ex-Marine Terry Richmond (Aaron Pierre) off the road for cycling while Black, they also seize the money he had been planning to use to post his cousin’s bail. Despite the injustice, Terry tries to do everything by the book but finds almost every aspect of the legal system against him. Out of patience, and fueled by immensely justified anger, he sets about tearing out the rot from the small town, aided only by court clerk Summer (AnnaSophia Robb). Writer-director Jeremy Saulnier could have made Rebel Ridge merely a modern day First Blood, but while there’s plenty of visceral, bone-breaking fight scenes, it’s the film’s righteously angry look at the baked-in failings of the American legal system that gives this its bite—all while cementing Pierre as an action star to watch.

Under Paris

This so-serious-it's-ludicrous French creature feature sees Bérénice Bejo as marine specialist Sophia Assalas, who is hunting down a mako shark that has not only spontaneously mutated to survive in the freshwater Seine but is also about to give birth to a host of baby man-eating sharks. Worse still? Paris is about to hold a triathlon, with the swim portion set to become an all-you-can-eat buffet! Look, not everything on this list needs to be high art—sometimes, you just need to see a mutant shark straight up chomping on people while increasingly desperate humans start blowing stuff up. Press Play, turn brain off, enjoy.

Hit Man

Gary Johnson (Glen Powell) is a mild-mannered professor of philosophy—and a contract killer. Well, not quite. He just poses as one, working with the New Orleans Police Department to trap people looking to hire a hit man. It's a role he's surprisingly good at, but when Madison (Adria Arjona) looks to have her abusive husband “dealt” with, Gary begins to fall for her—and the consequences could be fatal for real. In another creator’s hands, Hit Man might have been either overly grim or simply insubstantial (it's loosely based on a true story), but director Richard Linklater leverages his signature uses of sparkling dialog and brilliantly realized characters to deliver a smart action-comedy that explores the roles people play in society as much as it serves up mistaken-identity hijinks.

Godzilla Minus One

Despite the presence of the eponymous kaiju, Godzilla Minus One is a film rooted in the humanity of its protagonists, deserter kamikaze pilot Koichi Shikishima (Ryunosuke Kamiki) and Noriko Ōishi (Minami Hamabe), a survivor of the bombings of Tokyo. Thrown together as an ersatz family as they raise an orphaned baby, their attempts to build a new life turn chaotic when the irradiated reptile descends on the city just as it's beginning to recover. Director Takashi Yamazaki's reimagining of Japan's premier kaiju netted the King of Monsters its first-ever Oscar, picking up a statue for Best Visual Effects at the 2024 Academy Awards, but this is a film that exceeds mere spectacle—it's a searing examination of life after war, and how a nation grapples with being on the losing side.

Suzume

Suzume Iwato (voiced by Nanoka Hara in Japanese, Nichole Sakura in English) lives with her aunt on Japan's southern island, having lost her mother in the Tōhoku earthquake of 2011. When a handsome young stranger named Souta (Hokuto Matsumura, Josh Keaton) asks her for directions to some local ruins, she follows him out of curiosity but disturbs a living keystone, accidentally unleashing an ancient power that threatens to destroy the entire country. Drawn into Souta's world, the pair chase the keystone, now in the form of a cat, across Japan in a desperate bid to reseal the destructive entity—a quest that would be easier if Souta hadn't been transformed into a child's wooden chair. The latest film from Makoto Shinkai (Your Name, Weathering with You), Suzume is a breathtakingly animated slice of magical realism with a surrealist edge—but beyond the spectacle, it's a heart-warming tale of community and humanity, each stop on the unlikely pair's journey a snapshot of people and families coming together in the wake of tragedy.

Rustin

Directed by George C. Wolfe (Ma Rainey's Black Bottom), this biopic explores the life of civil rights activist Bayard Rustin. While perhaps best known as one of the chief organizers of 1963's March on Washington, Rustin was also openly, unapologetically gay at a time when that was phenomenally rare—and the film doesn't shy away from how that alienated many of the people he worked with, his sexuality often seen as a threat to the movement. A much-needed spotlight on an overlooked but pivotal figure in the Civil Rights Movement, elevated by a central performance from a spectacularly well-cast Colman Domingo as Rustin himself.

His House

Fleeing war-torn South Sudan, Bol (Ṣọpẹ́ Dìrísù) and Rial (Wunmi Mosaku) are now living in a run-down house at the edge of London, harassed by their neighbors even as they try to fit in. The couple are also haunted by the lives they left behind—both figuratively and (possibly) literally, with visions of their late daughter Nyagak, who did not survive the journey, fading in and out of the walls of their dismal new home. The real horror of His House isn't the strange visions, haunted house, or potential ghosts, though—it’s the bleakness of the lives Bol and Rial are forced into, the hostility and dehumanization of the UK asylum process, the racism both overt and casual, all coupled with the enormous sense of loss they carry with them. Blending the macabre with the mundane, director Remi Weekes delivers a tense, challenging film that will haunt viewers as much as its characters.

The Black Book

Paul Edima (Richard Mofe-Damijo) lives a peaceful life as a church deacon, trying to atone for—or at least forget—his former deeds as a highly trained special agent. Plans to leave his violent and bloody past behind fall apart when his son is framed for a murder and then killed by corrupt police, forcing him to fall back on old skills as he seeks vengeance. Shades of Taken, yes, but it's director Editi Effiong's raw energy and fresh takes on familiar action movie formulas that—backed by one of the highest budgets in ""Nollywood"" history—have this gritty outing topping the most-watched lists as far afield as South Korea. Expand your cinematic horizons and see what the fuss is about.

Eldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate

Centered on the eponymous Berlin nightclub, this documentary explores the lives of LGBTQ+ people during the interwar years, from the roaring 1920s through the rise of the Nazis and into the horrors of World War II. With a blend of archival footage, recreations, and first-person accounts, director Benjamin Cantu paints a picture of gleeful decadence, the Eldorado as an almost hallowed ground where performers and patrons alike experimented with gender expression and were free to openly display their sexuality. It's an ode to what was lost, but with an eye on the bizarre contradictions of the age, where openly gay club-goers would wear their own Nazi uniforms as the years went by. Everything the Nazis Hate is emotionally challenging viewing in places, but it serves up an important slice of queer history that many will be completely unaware of.

Marry My Dead Body

Wu Ming-han (Greg Hsu) is not a great guy. A homophobic police officer, his life—and prejudices—are changed when he picks up an unassuming red envelope while investigating a case. Now bound under “ghost marriage” customs to Mao Mao (Austin Lin), a gay man who died under mysterious circumstances, Wu has to solve his “husband's” death before he can get on with his life. Directed by Cheng Wei-hao, better known for his thrillers and horror movies, Marry My Dead Body sees the Taiwanese director bring his supernatural stylings to this ghostly absurdist comedy for a film that transcends borders.

They Cloned Tyrone

Drug dealer Fontaine (John Boyega) got shot to death last night. So why has he just woken up in bed as if nothing happened? That existential question leads Fontaine and two unlikely allies—prostitute Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris) and pimp Slick Charles (Jamie Foxx)—to uncovering a vast conspiracy centered on a Black-majority town called The Glen, where people are kept mollified by hypnotic rap music, dumbed down with drug-laced fried chicken and grape juice, and preached into obedience at church. But who’s using the town as a petri dish, and why is there a cloning lab buried underground? This lethally sharp satire from writer and debut director Juel Taylor masterfully blends genres, from the use of visual motifs and dated clichés from 1970s Blaxploitation cinema to its frequent steps into sci-fi territory and laugh-out-loud comedy. But it’s the powerhouse performances from its central cast that mark this as one to watch.

Nimona

Shapeshifter Nimona can become anything she wants, a gift that causes people to fear and shun her. If society is going to treat her like a villain, she's going to be one, so she decides to become the sidekick of the hated black knight, Ballister Blackheart. Unfortunately for the aspiring menace, Blackheart isn't quite the monster he's made out to be, and he instead tries to rein in Nimona's more murderous tendencies as he seeks to clear his name of a crime he didn't commit—and face down his old friend Ambrosius Goldenloin in the process. Adapted from N. D. Stevenson's groundbreaking graphic novel, Nimona is more than just another fanciful fantasy—it's a tale of outsiders and exiles, people trying to do right even when their community rejects them, and the joy of finding their own little band along the way. After an almost decade-long journey to the screen, this dazzlingly animated movie has become an instant classic.

Cargo

In a world already ravaged by a zombie-like plague, Andy Rose (Martin Freeman) only wants to keep his family safe, sticking to Australia’s rural back roads to avoid infection. After his wife is tragically bitten, and infects him in turn, Andy is desperate to find a safe haven for his infant daughter, Rosie. With a mere 48 hours until he succumbs himself, Andy finds an ally in Thoomi (Simone Landers), an Aboriginal girl looking to protect her own rabid father. But with threats from paranoid survivalists and Aboriginal communities hunting the infected, it may already be too late. A unique twist on the zombie apocalypse, Cargo abandons the familiar urban landscapes of the genre for the breathtaking wilds of Australia and offers a slower, character-led approach to the end of the world.

Call Me Chihiro

An idyllic slice-of-life movie with a twist, Call Me Chihiro follows a former sex worker—the eponymous Chihiro, played by Kasumi Arimura—after she moves to a seaside town to work in a bento restaurant. This isn’t a tale of a woman on the run or trying to escape her past—Chihiro is refreshingly forthright and unapologetic, and her warmth and openness soon begin to change the lives of her neighbors. Directed by Rikiya Imaizumi, this is an intimate, heartfelt character drama that alternates between moments of aching loneliness and sheer joy, packed with emotional beats that remind viewers of the importance of even the smallest connections.

Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery

Daniel Craig reprises his role as detective Benoit Blanc in this brilliant follow-up to 2019’s phenomenal whodunnit, Knives Out. Writer-director Rian Johnson crafts a fiendishly sharp new case for “the Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths,” taking Blanc to a Greek island getaway for a reclusive tech billionaire and his collection of friends and hangers-on, where a planned murder mystery weekend takes a deadly turn. While totally accessible for newcomers, fans of the first film will also be rewarded with some deeper character development for Blanc, a role that’s shaping up to be as iconic for Craig as 007. As cleverly written and meticulously constructed as its predecessor, and featuring the kind of all-star cast—Edward Norton! Janelle Monáe! Kathryn Hahn! Leslie Odom Jr.! Jessica Henwick! Madelyn Cline! Kate Hudson! Dave Bautista!—that cinema dreams are made of, Glass Onion might be the best thing Netflix has dropped all year.

The Wonder

Florence Pugh dazzles in this not-quite-horror film from Oscar-winning director Sebastián Lelio. Set in 1862, English nurse Lib Wright (Pugh) is sent to Ireland to observe Anna O’Donnell, a girl who claims to have not eaten in four months, subsisting instead on “manna from heaven.” Still grieving the loss of her own child, Lib is torn between investigating the medical impossibility and growing concern for Anna herself. Amid obstacles in the form of Anna’s deeply religious family and a local community that distrusts her, Lib’s watch descends into a tense, terrifying experience. Based on a book of the same name by Emma Donoghue, The Wonder is a beautiful yet bleakly shot period piece that explores the all-too-mortal horrors that unquestioning religious fervor and family secrets can wreak.

RRR

One of India’s biggest films of all time, RRR (or Rise, Roar, Revolt) redefines the notion of cinematic spectacle. Set in 1920, the historical epic follows real-life Indian revolutionaries Alluri Sitrama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.) but fictionalizes their lives and actions. Although they come from very different walks of life, their similarities draw them together as they face down sadistic governor Scott Buxton (Ray Stevenson) and his cruel wife, Catherine (Alison Doody). No mere period fluff, RRR is a bold, exciting, and often explosive piece of filmmaking that elevates its heroes to near-mythological status. Director S. S. Rajamouli deploys brilliantly shot action scenes—and an exquisitely choreographed dance number—that grab viewers’ attention and refuse to let go. Whether you’re a longtime fan of Indian cinema or just looking for an action flick beyond the Hollywood norm, RRR is not to be missed.

I Lost My Body

An award winner at Cannes in 2019, this tale of burgeoning young love, obsession, and autonomous body parts is every bit as weird as you might expect for a French adult animated film. Director Jérémy Clapin charts the life of Naoufel, a Moroccan immigrant in modern-day France who falls for the distant Gabrielle, and Naoufel’s severed hand, which makes its way across the city to try to reconnect. With intersecting timelines and complex discussions about fate, I Lost My Body is often mind-bending yet always captivating, and Clapin employs brilliantly detailed animation and phenomenal color choices throughout. Worth watching in both the original French and the solid English dub featuring Dev Patel and Alia Shawkat, this one dares you to make sense of it all.

Don’t Look Up

Frustrated by the world’s collective inaction on existential threats like climate change? Maybe don’t watch Don’t Look Up, director Adam McKay’s satirical black comedy. When two low-level astronomers discover a planet-killing comet on a collision course with Earth, they try to warn the authorities—only to be met with a collective “meh.” Matters only get worse when they attempt to leak the news themselves and have to navigate vapid TV hosts, celebrities looking for a signature cause, and an indifferent public. A bleakly funny indictment of our times, bolstered by a star-studded cast fronted by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence, Don’t Look Up is, somewhat depressingly, one of the best portraits of humanity since Idiocracy.",,"Matt Kamen, Wired Staff, Angela Watercutter, Emily Mullin","47, life, way, movies, action, movie, finds, lives, netflix, right, best, film, family, director",pending,2025-08-16T13:29:06.148022+00:00,31be143b0957d6e2729fcdece1517efc90cb29e4371396d6f1dbd4f4ccec8986

Ballard

A spin-off from Bosch, one of Prime’s biggest hits, Ballard is another creation of crime author Michael Connelly, seeing detective Renée Ballard (Maggie Q, Designated Survivor) stepping up as head of a newly formed cold-case unit. Left with no budget and no official support, Ballard hastily assembles a team of volunteers that includes her retired former partner Thomas Laffont (John Carroll Lynch) and disillusioned former cop Zamira Parker (Courtney Taylor). They soon find that diving into forgotten cases can mean unearthing secrets powerful people want to keep buried. A blend of crime-of-the-week cases and season-long mysteries make Ballard both a cozy procedural and a riveting longer-form drama, buoyed by a fantastic cast—including Titus Welliver reprising his role as Connellyverse staple Harry Bosch.

The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy

If about 300 seasons of Grey's Anatomy hasn't scratched your medical drama itch, then a visit to The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy might be just the treatment you need. Riffing on the hospital procedural genre and giving it a sci-fi twist, the show follows alien medics Dr. Sleech (Stephanie Hsu) and Dr. Klak (Keke Palmer) as they tackle the wildest diseases and injuries the universe can throw at them—from an anxiety-eating brain worm to a shape-shifting STI—all while navigating messy relationships and personal drama. See, just like Grey’s. Created by Russian Doll writer Cirocco Dunlap—bringing that show’s Natasha Lyonne along as the voice of occasionally invisible Nurse Tup—this Saharan-dry adult animated comedy will cure what ails you.

Overcompensating

Benny is so deep in the closet, he's found Narnia. And rather than using his freshman year of college as a chance to find himself, he's maintaining the illusion of heterosexuality by throwing himself into a campus life of partying, drinking, and chasing girls. The consequences, for Benny and his new best friend Carmen (Wally Beram), will be severe … but hilarious. Created by comedian Benito Skinner, who also stars as Benny, Overcompensating is a foul-mouthed and ferociously funny college comedy that's almost painfully authentic in its depiction of the fine line between self-exploration and weapons-grade cringe.

Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX

Prime Video doesn't tend to pick up as much anime as rival Netflix does, but when it does, it's often something big. Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX (it's pronounced “gee-kwux,” before you ask), takes things back to the very beginning of the iconic mecha franchise and asks a simple question: What if the bad guys, the “space Nazis” of the Principality of Zeon, won a crucial war? Don't worry if you can't tell a beam saber from a core fighter though—this alternate reality focuses on brand new character Amate Yuzuriha, a high school student thrust into a world of mounting military tensions after an experimental Gundam crashes into the space colony where she lives. GQuuuuuux also marks a creative high for Gundam, with Evangelion studio Khara bringing its dynamic style of animation to the series, but beyond the phenomenally flashy visuals, this has some real emotional depth, using a science fiction lens to explore how people can find hope and fight for freedom, even in the darkest of timelines. Weekly episodes drop on Tuesdays.

The Wheel of Time

The Wheel of Time has been a bit of a slow burn, but now this fantasy series is a raging fire. The first season introduced magic weaver Moiraine (Rosamund Pike) and her quest to uncover which of five unassuming young people is destined to save or destroy the world, then the second upped the stakes—returning ancient evils while scattering the only people able to stop them. The newly dropped third season pays it off in spades, though, opening with a ferocious battle between brutal woman warriors—a genre rarity—while setting the stage for Rand al’Thor (Josha Stradowski) to seize that dangerous destiny, one way or the other. Based on Robert Jordan’s sprawling novel series—one so vast it makes Game of Thrones look concise—this visually stunning series has cemented itself as the finest fantasy show around.

Reacher

Amazon has a way with action thrillers focused on military tough guys who answer to “Jack R.” First there was Jack Ryan, who also makes an appearance in this guide. Then there was Reacher, the sharp adaptation of Lee Child’s Jack Reacher novels, now in its third season. Alan Ritchson (Titans, Fast X) stars as the physically imposing Reacher, a former military policeman now drifting from town to town, trying to live a quiet life but unable to avoid conflict. Season one found him accused of a murder he didn't commit, before season two drew him into a vast conspiracy. The newly arrived third—based on the seventh novel, Persuader—sees him up against his biggest threat yet: Paulie, an even bigger hulk of muscle (played by 7′2″ Olivier Richters). Sure, Reacher is also working undercover for the DEA and tracking down an old enemy, but three seasons in, the show is confident enough to play to its pulpy strengths, with top-tier fight choreography and surprisingly sharp dialog helping it punch above its weight.

Invincible

Mark Grayson inherited the incredible powers and abilities of his father, Omni-Man—only to learn dear old dad wasn't a paragon of justice but the vanguard for an alien invasion. The newly dropped third season of Invincible finds Mark not only still struggling to escape his father's shadow, guiding his younger brother to use his own burgeoning powers responsibly, but also drowning in a world of murky politics, pushed toward darker, tougher choices to keep Earth safe. A brilliantly animated adaptation of the hit Image comic book by writer Robert Kirkman and artists Cory Walker and Ryan Ottley, Invincible’s more mature take on superheroes allows it to do something Marvel and DC characters rarely do: grow up.

The Man in the High Castle

This adaptation of sci-fi master Philip K. Dick’s novel about a world in which the Nazis won the Second World War was one of Amazon’s first forays into original content. The world-building is stunningly done—a divided, alternate-reality 1960s America never seemed so plausible—but be warned: There might be just a touch too much present-day resonance for some viewers.

The Rig

Back for its second season, sci-fi thriller The Rig finds the surviving crew of isolated North Sea oil rig Kinloch Bravo forcibly relocated to The Stac, an even more remote facility in the Arctic. While most are desperate for answers and a way home, the team’s loyalties are tested as the sinister Pictor corporation seeks to use them to unearth something ancient and powerful from the sea floor. While The Rig doesn’t even aspire to subtlety when it comes to its ecological metaphors (one character even says, “If you keep punching holes in the Earth, eventually the Earth’s going to punch back”), it’s all brilliantly shot to make use of both the claustrophobic settings and the terrifying expanses and underwater pressures of the ocean. With the material elevated by a phenomenal cast of Game of Thrones and Line of Duty veterans, including Iain Glen and Rochenda Sandall—and bolstered further by the addition of the always-watchable Alice Krige in season 2—The Rig is far more than the guilty pleasure it might otherwise be.

Cross

Aldis Hodge steps into the shoes of Washington, DC homicide detective Alex Cross in Prime's new series based on James Patterson's long-running series of crime novels. However, unlike the streamer's other thrillers Bosch and Reacher, Cross doesn't directly adapt any of Patterson's books—a risky move, but one that largely pays off, allowing this eight-episode first season to chart an unpredictable journey as Cross faces off against a twisted murderer who models each of his kills on another serial killer. Already renewed for a second season, Cross is a strong addition to Prime's roster of crime dramas.

Citadel: Diana

Amazon tried to make a splash with its $300 million spy thriller Citadel in 2023, but only half-succeeded. The Richard Madden- and Priyanka Chopra-starring action series was entertaining enough—and rode high on Prime Video’s most-watched lists—but didn’t exactly set the world alight. However, it did establish a sprawling shared universe, with rival organizations Citadel and Manticore engaged in a globe-spanning cold war setting the stage for international spin-offs. Citadel: Diana is the first, an Italian outing focusing on Diana (Matilda De Angelis), a woman out for revenge after her parents are killed, and drawn into the spy-fi underworld with violent results. Gorgeous location shoots, bone-crunching fight choreography, and, most importantly, a tighter focus help Diana improve on its parent series.

The Legend of Vox Machina

Bawdy, gory, and absolutely not for kids, The Legend of Vox Machina follows the eponymous adventurers' guild—consisting of gunslingers, druids, and the requisite horny bard—as they grow from a motley crew of usually-drunk mercenaries into unexpected heroes for the realm of Exandria. The newly arrived third season continues the team's battle against the Chroma Conclave, a horrifyingly powerful collective of dragons. It's a quest that sends them on a small diversion to Hell itself. Adapting the hit Critical Role—the livestreamed Dungeons & Dragons sessions of some of the biggest voice actors in animation and gaming—this exquisitely animated fantasy takes things in unexpected directions that keep things fresh for new or returning viewers alike. A love letter to D&D that's also unafraid to poke fun at the classic RPG, it's one of the most original adult animated shows on Prime.

The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power

Tapping into The Lord of the Rings creator J. R. R. Tolkien’s sprawling history of Middle-earth, The Rings of Power is set millennia before the events of the core books (or films, which is really where the visual language of this adaptation comes from), detailing the major events of Tolkien’s Second Age. While the first season was a slow burn, dwelling on the fractious politics of the era, the second ratchets up the pace considerably. From Galadriel (Morfydd Clark) trying to prevent the ascension of Dark Lord Sauron (Charlie Vickers) to the long-awaited introduction of fan-favorite character Tom Bombadil (Rory Kinnear), the new season feels far richer and deeper than before. It remains a feast for the eyes too, with the stratospheric budget apparent in every frame, from quiet moments in luxuriant shires to cinematic battles between armies of Orcs and Elves. For sheer high fantasy spectacle, there’s little else to rival this streaming right now.

Batman: Caped Crusader

The first new solo Batman animated series in a decade, Caped Crusader harkens back to Batman: The Animated Series from the 1990s, with showrunner Bruce Timm returning to the Dark Knight and Hamish Linklater voicing Bruce Wayne/Batman in an ode to the late, great Kevin Conroy. Unlike rival ‘90s revival X-Men ’97, though, this isn't a continuation but rather a wholly distinct take allowing for fresh interpretations of the iconic hero’s rogues’ gallery and allies—look out for drastically different takes on the Penguin and Harley Quinn in particular. Leaning heavily into a 1930s aesthetic that evokes Batman’s earliest comic book origins, this manages to be nostalgic and provocative at once—a fantastic outing that takes DC's original urban vigilante back to his gritty pulp noir roots.

The Boys

Superheroes are meant to represent hope and optimism—the best of us, given outsize form. In The Boys, adapted from the darkly satirical comic by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, they’re a reflection of humanity’s worst—greed and unrestrained power, marketed to a gullible public by vested corporate interests, operating without restraint and leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and his associates The Boys, gleefully dispatching “Supes” who’ve gone too far, often in extraordinarily violent ways. Unfortunately, the newly dropped fourth season finds the team in disarray, fractured by Butcher’s own lies, right as the world needs them most. Arch-manipulator Victoria Neuman (Claudia Doumit) is close to the Oval Office, while the sadistic, psychotic Homelander (Antony Starr) is planning a superhuman uprising. Probably Amazon’s goriest show, The Boys stands as a pertinent examination of the abuses of power, all wrapped in superhero drag.

Fallout

Maybe the end of the world is the secret sauce to making a great video game adaptation—between The Last of Us and now this spectacular interpretation of Bethesda's postapocalyptic RPG series, we're living in an unexpected golden era for the form. Yet unlike HBO's bleak but beautiful world, Fallout taps into the source material to craft an apocalypse with a very different feel, one dripping in cracked Americana, black comedy, razor-sharp social satire, and just a little bit of camp. Its greatest strength, though, lies in how it doesn’t directly adapt any one of the core Fallout games. Instead, it perfectly channels their tone and feel, focusing on a core trio—naive Lucy (Ella Purnell), born and raised in a subterranean vault; driven Maximus (Aaron Moten), a recruit in an army seeking technology from the old world; and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), a centuries-old bounty hunter mutated into a nigh-immortal zombie when the bombs fell—to showcase just how brilliantly twisted this nuclear wasteland really is.

Three-Body

No, you're not on the Netflix list—Prime Video has its own distinct adaptation of Cixin Liu's The Three-Body Problem. This take, originally released for Chinese audiences back in 2023, faithfully adapts Liu's award-winning novel of humanity's first contact with an almost unknowable alien species and the impact that their impending arrival on Earth has on humanity. Hopping between time periods, a galactic mystery unfurls after nanotech specialist Wang Miao (Luyi Zhang) is called in by detective Shi Qiang (Hewei Yu) to investigate a global spate of suicides among scientists, with the ominous phrase ""Physics doesn't exist"" being the only link between the deaths. Although Three-Body is a bit softer than Netflix's 3 Body Problem when dealing with some aspects of the story—notably anything related to China's Cultural Revolution—a hearty 30-episode run allows for far more space to explore Liu's complex themes and vast roster of characters. The pacing may take some getting used to for viewers more accustomed to western TV, and it's subtitled-only, but this C-drama is out of this world.

Mr. and Mrs. Smith

You likely know the concept from the name alone—a married couple operate as undercover agents, blurring the lines between their personal and professional relationship. Unlike the 2005 Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie, though, 2024's Mr. and Mrs. Smith does far more with the concept. Donald Glover (who cocreated this reboot) and Maya Erskine offer much more developed takes on the mysterious characters of “John” and “Jane” Smith over the course of this eight-episode series, exploring their true identities, why they signed up for their dangerous careers, and whether their growing feelings for each other are just part of the roles they're playing. It's all backed up with plenty of Mission: Impossible–style action, of course, but it’s the sparkling chemistry between the show's leads that will leave you thinking, “Brangelina who?”

Gen V

Spinning out of Amazon's hit The Boys, Gen V follows the next generation of supes, training their abilities at the Godolkin University School of Crimefighting. In keeping with its twisted parent show, this educational establishment is less Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters and more The Hunger Games with superpowers, as students battle for glory and a chance to join premier super-team The Seven. Lead Jaz Sinclair (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) impresses as freshman Marie Moreau, a haemokinetic with lofty ambitions who uncovers dark secrets at the college that challenge her entire world view. Factor in all the poor life choices college students are famed for and some extremely creative (if often disgusting) superpowers, then allow for The Boys' trademark ultraviolence, and one thing's for sure—the kids of Gen V are most definitely not alright.

Jack Ryan

There's no shortage of screen adaptations of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan books, but John Krasinski's turn as the CIA desk jockey turned field agent gets far more room to breathe than its predecessors. The prestige political thriller charts Ryan's rise from analyst to operative—and beyond—over four perfectly crafted seasons. The final season caps Ryan's career with his biggest challenge yet, investigating the convergence of a drug cartel and a terrorist organization set to create an unstoppable criminal enterprise, all while juggling the CIA's possible involvement in a political assassination in Nigeria. While the show hasn't been without controversies—season two attracted condemnation from Venezuela's government for supposedly condoning a US invasion of the country; big yikes there—its sharp writing, incredible performances, and cinematic action make it compelling viewing.

I'm a Virgo

A surrealist comedy with the sharp political and social edge viewers have come to expect from creator and director Boots Riley (Sorry to Bother You), I’m a Virgo follows Cootie (Jharrel Jerome), a regular 19-year-old who just happens to be 13 feet tall. Raised in secrecy by Aunt Lafrancine (Carmen Ejogo) and Uncle Martisse (Mike Epps), Cootie is thrust into the limelight when his larger-than-life existence is inevitably discovered. Experiencing friendships and the outside world for the first time, gentle giant Cootie has to navigate everything from romance to the public’s reaction to a giant Black man wandering around Oakland. Oh, and did we mention Cootie’s idol, The Hero, a real-life superhero with an authoritarian streak that would put some of the worst offenders on The Boys to shame? Told you this was surreal. Do yourself a favor and watch the behind-the-scenes episodes too, tucked under Prime Video’s “Explore” tab, for Riley’s insight into each episode.

Tales From the Loop

Despite being a couple of years old, Tales From the Loop remains one of the most mesmerizing shows on Prime Video. Loosely based on the work of Swedish artist Simon Stålenhag, the series blurs the line between ongoing narrative and anthology as it follows the residents of Mercer, Ohio, exploring how their intersecting lives are impacted by “the Loop,” an underground facility exploring experimental physics and making the impossible possible. Expect tales of frozen time, traded lives, and parallel worlds, all brought to life by a fantastic cast and directors—including Andrew Stanton and Jodie Foster. But it’s the visuals that really elevate this show, which captures the sublime aesthetic of Stålenhag’s work and juxtaposes neofuturism and rural communities for a world that looks and feels like almost nothing else. At only eight episodes, a visit to Mercer is brief but unforgettable.

The Underground Railroad

Based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning novel by Colson Whitehead, this limited series from Moonlight director Barry Jenkins sticks pretty closely to the premise of the book. It’s a work of historical fiction that takes the idea of the Underground Railroad—the network of smugglers who helped escaped slaves flee the South—and reimagines it as an actual subway system with trains and secretive station agents.

The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel

What is a New York lady to do when she finds out her husband is having an affair with his dim-witted secretary? If Mrs. Maisel is anything to go by, the answer is to head to a dingy watering hole in your nightgown, do a little standup comedy, and get hauled away by the police after flashing the entire audience. Set in the 1950s, this fast-talking fashionista hides her new life as a comedian from her family and ex while battling sexism, bad crowds, and big competition. Rachel Brosnahan stars as Midge Maisel in this subtle nod to Joan Rivers’ career. With four seasons and a host of awards and nominations to its name, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is one of Amazon’s sharpest comedies.",,"Matt Kamen, Wired Staff, Angela Watercutter, Adam Morgan","amazon, right, prime, 24, second, boys, newly, far, series, best, world, season, takes, shows",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:42.101941+00:00,c292468c4d0c615da7608ac0219507668ae21e232112e7159b5d1a8c7f573f0f

We’ve still got love for the console and its many millions of owners, so we’ll keep recommending the best controllers for the Switch right here. If you’re considering getting a Switch 2 in the future, all of the controllers below will work on the newer console.

Now, you may have already realized long ago that the best Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with the console. The removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient, given they can be detached for wireless use for up to two players with a pair, but their tiny shape doesn’t do them many favors. They aren’t comfortable to hold for long gaming sessions — especially if you have large hands. And, you’re definitely not alone if you’ve experienced Joy-Con drift.

In this buying guide, we’ll focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed that may match your unique play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock here, as they’re mostly similar to each other and the savings aren’t worth giving up wireless freedom for.

There are some things that are worth knowing if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), it may not support HD rumble, motion controls, NFC for Amiibo, or be able to wake the Switch remotely. However, there are some exceptions, which we feature below.

Featured in this article

What we’re looking for How we test Nintendo Switch controllers Collapse We test Nintendo Switch controllers by playing with them with a standard grip — the same way most gamers do. We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, racers like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and shooters like Overwatch 2. We pay attention to how everything feels — buttons, triggers, analog sticks, the D-pad — noting whether anything seems off. Connectivity Collapse Does it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz? Ideally (but not always), a controller we recommend is compatible with other platforms, too. Quality Collapse Do the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches? Extra features and customization Collapse Are there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macro settings? Can you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity? Value Collapse Is it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?

The best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode

Supported platforms: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes (but not the Switch 2)

Ever since the Switch launched, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller has been the best gamepad for the console. In many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality. And, it’s compatible with the Switch 2 (although it can’t wake the new console from sleep — you’ll need a Switch 2 Pro Controller for that).

Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s one of a few controllers we’ve tested (aside from the Joy-Con and 8BitDo’s Ultimate series) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.

The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, aside from Xbox and PlayStation.

Given the high price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t possible. If you really want the ability to listen via wired headphones without connecting your controller with a wire, you’ll need to get the Switch 2 and its Switch 2 Pro controller.

The best Switch controller for handheld mode

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch OLED / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No

I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re very comfortable. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Compact can help out.

The Split Pad Compact is a — you guessed it — a more compact alternative to the Split Pad Pro, which has unfortunately become tougher to find. Similarly, it comes in a variety of colorways, and it adds comfort to using the Switch in handheld mode. One half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides more grip than Joy-Con do, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast-paced gameplay, or to stay comfy over longer play sessions.

The Split Pad Compact fits in your Switch’s Joy-Con slots and doubles as a standalone controller with the optional attachment set. Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge

The Split Pad Compact doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Compact Attachment that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment usually (but not always) costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned features. It does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however.

The best Xbox-style controller for the Switch

Supported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes (only in KK3 Max) / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes

On the surface, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and KingKong 3 Max are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.

But there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).

Additionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge.

The longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.

In summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer a lot for the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.

The best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Android, macOS, Apple devices / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable buttons: Yes, four / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes, but not Switch 2

8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller is a minor step forward compared to the first iteration, but it comes with new features you might care about. It still feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. As for what’s changed internally, you’re getting more durable TMR joysticks, plus two new mappable buttons near the triggers (totaling four customizable buttons). Speaking of the triggers, they’re adjustable thanks to new switches that can alter how much you have to pull them to register an input. It’s particularly great for first-person shooters or action games where speed is paramount.

Its haptics are decent in some games, but not nearly as good as Nintendo’s HD Rumble, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. It’s a nice value compared to the Switch Pro, as well as most other third-party options because it also includes a charging dock with an integrated 2.4GHz transmitter.

The Ultimate 2 controller comes in two variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model for Switch owners because it’s the only version that’s compatible. Additionally, it’s compatible with the Switch 2, the Steam Deck, PC, macOS computers, and a slew of other Bluetooth-ready devices. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity, in case you need a more reliable connection for compatible devices.

As for any control scheme tweaks you may want to make, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software V2 app on PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for great third-party controllers, and this is one of its best.

A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock

Supported Platforms: Switch, Switch 2, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, and more / Connectivity: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable buttons: Yes, four / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes, but not Switch 2

The 8BitDo Pro 3 is the company’s latest high-end controller. On its face, the biggest difference between it and the similarly-priced Ultimate 2 is its PlayStation DualShock-esque stick layout, which alone might enough to convince some gamers to get it. The Pro 3 improves on its predecessor by featuring swappable buttons that can be detached with its included magnetic suction tool. With it, you can go from the Nintendo layout to the Xbox layout. Otherwise, this model’s internal specs and compatibility are very similar to that of the Ultimate 2.

The Pro 3 features TMR joysticks, plus Hall effect triggers with switches that toggle between full pulls or shorter clicks for either trigger. Just like the Ultimate 2, the Pro 3 has four customizable buttons that can be assigned almost any other button, or combination of buttons, through the company’s Ultimate V2 app on PC or by pressing certain buttons together, as listed in the manual. Additionally, the controller supports turbo mode.

Compared to most other Switch controllers, the Pro 3 stands out due to its PlayStation-style layout of D-pad and sticks. You may prefer this model if you play a lot of retro games that prioritize the D-pad, which is more easily accessible than on most other Switch controllers. One other fun perk of the Pro 3 is its swappable joystick caps. Two arcade stick-like knobs are included that make certain games feel more rewarding to play, such as fighting games.

It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Overwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming.

Each controller includes swappable arcade stick caps. Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge

On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, and DirectInput, each of which offers its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. One new addition for the Pro 3 is a charging dock that lets the controller recharge via contact pins. The dock also contains a 2.4GHz USB-C transmitter, letting you connect to some devices that route instead of Bluetooth.

An adapter that lets you use your own controllers

There are a few other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s is the best value. Instead of spending $70 on a Switch Pro controller, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn most Bluetooth controllers you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock (or directly into the console if you have a USB-A to USB-C adapter) and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model we’ve linked to.)

To our delight, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.

8BitDo’s dongle supports most Bluetooth controllers, including official Xbox and PlayStation gamepads. Image: 8BitDo

8BitDo has an extensive support page that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.

If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.

Other Switch controllers we tested

We like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).

We recently tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($49.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.

We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($44.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.

What’s coming next?

We’ll be doing more testing on the EasySMX S10 controller, as well as the GameSir Super Nove and GuliKit’s Elves 2 and ES Pro controllers for consideration.

Update, August 15th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability. We’ve added the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 and Pro 3 controllers as new recommended options. The next update will include impressions on new EasySMX, GameSir, and GuliKit controllers.",,"Quentyn Kennemer, Cameron Faulkner, Quentyn Kennemer Cameron Faulkner","right, nintendo, console, controller, buy, yes, bluetooth, best, buttons, pro, rumble, wireless, switch, controllers",pending,2025-08-15T23:52:20.710177+00:00,6d2e35d6451ad8e3238b62edb7f2aabf9f60dda2029250a0e6c67dd7a2055ce2

Music by John Williams

With all the hoopla surrounding the 50th anniversary of Jaws, now seems like the perfect time to show our appreciation for composer John Williams—without whom, that Steven Spielberg classic (and pretty much any Spielberg classic) would not feel the same. The second-most-nominated person in Oscar history (his 54 nominations are only bested by Walt Disney, who earned 59 nods), Williams has been producing memorable movie scores for nearly 70 years now and has quietly helped to turn movies into cinema. This original documentary gathers up some of the 93-year-old’s closest collaborators, including Spielberg and George Lucas—who swears that “Star Wars would basically not be Star Wars without Johnny Williams’ music.” It’s a touching, and perhaps long overdue, tribute to a true Hollywood titan.

Jaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story

As the original “summer blockbuster,” one might imagine that there are few behind-the-scenes stories fans have yet to hear from Steven Spielberg and Co. about the making of Jaws. But this Nat Geo documentary proves that even the movie’s most diehard fans might still have a thing or two to learn about the film that scared millions of beachgoers away from the water. In celebration of the film’s 50th anniversary, this 90-minute doc features interviews with Spielberg—and many people who have been inspired by the movie over the years—to help you see it in a whole new light.

Sally

More than 40 years after Sally Ride became the first American woman to go into space, Tam O’Shaughnessy—Ride’s life partner for 27 years—is telling the real story of Ride’s life. And the many sacrifices she felt forced to make to both pursue her dreams of conquering the final frontier and live life as a gay woman. Emmy-winning documentarian Cristina Costantini directs the film, which is the first time the true life of one of the world’s most famous women is told.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

In 2018, when Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse hit theaters, it changed perceptions of what Spider-Man movies, and animated films, could be. No longer led by Peter Parker, a kid from Queens who gets bit by a radioactive spider, it was fronted by Miles Morales, a kid from Brooklyn who met a similar fate in another part of the multiverse. Across the Spider-Verse continues Miles’ story and his quest to save the multiverse, and his timeline, from a terrible fate. Fun, heartbreaking, and a thrill to watch, it’s one of the best Spider-Man movies ever.

The Abyss

In many ways, The Abyss is the ultimate James Cameron movie. The idea for it first came to the filmmaker as a teenager, and it features all the storytelling and visual hallmarks of Cameron’s more famous movies. In a way, it’s essentially an underwater version of Aliens: A US submarine has been ambushed and sunk to the bottom of the ocean in the Caribbean. A Navy SEAL (Michael Biehn) and two petroleum engineers with a sticky romantic past (Ed Harris and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) are sent on a rescue mission, but are racing against the clock as a storm is gathering above the water and Soviet ships attempt to the reach the sunken sub before their American counterparts arrive. As one might expect in a Cameron flick, all is not as straightforward as it seems, and the rescuers encounter what is deemed “non-terrestrial intelligence.” Though originally released in 1989, this new 4K restoration gives new life to Cameron’s underwater sci-fi classic.

Elton John: Never Too Late

Slowly but surely, filmmaker R. J. Cutler is becoming America's foremost chronicler of celebrity. After covering Billie Eilish, Martha Stewart, and James Belushi, the documentarian has now trained his lens on Elton John. Following the hitmaker as he prepares for his final North American show at Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium in 2022, which livestreamed on Disney+, Elton John: Never Too Late jumps back and forth in time, using archival interviews and previously unseen footage to unearth a full picture of the musician's decades-long career. If nothing else, think of it as a companion piece to the 2019 biopic Rocketman.

Deadpool & Wolverine

The Deadpool movies have always stood out for being proudly anti–superhero movie and boldly R-rated. Even though Deadpool & Wolverine is the first film in the series that’s officially part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (it only took several years of production delays and one massive studio acquisition to make that happen), it's just as raunchy as the installments that came before. Six years after Ryan Reynolds last graced screens as the Merc with a Mouth, Deadpool has hit what might be his rock bottom. When he’s given the opportunity to regain the lives and loves he lost in another timeline, he must enlist the help of an extremely disinterested Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to make it happen. Reynolds and Jackman’s onscreen chemistry is electric, making this one (foul-mouthed) team-up you don’t want to miss.

Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band

Bruce Springsteen came out of the Covid-19 lockdowns revved up and ready to put on one hell of a show. For Road Diary, The Boss gave director Thom Zimny an all-access pass to the creation of the tour he and and the E Street Band have been on since 2024, including archival footage and interviews with the band and Springsteen himself. Zimny has been documenting the rocker’s life on the road for more than two decades now—and won two Emmy Awards for his efforts (for 2001’s Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band: Live in New York City and 2018’s Springsteen on Broadway)—making this documentary essential viewing for any fan.

Inside Out 2

Though it’s been 10 years since the release of Pixar’s Oscar-winning Inside Out, this sequel picks up just two years after the original film's ending. Riley, now 13 years old, is officially a teenager—and not quite ready to contend with the various new emotions that come with that phase. Among them: Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser). Fortunately for all of them, not to mention Riley’s parents, Joy (Amy Poehler) is still there to help balance these emotions out. Yet again, Pixar triumphs in making a movie with a message that is also fun for the whole family.

Inside Out

Don’t cry. But also cry. A lot. Inside Out is the perfect realization of what every Pixar film strives to achieve. On the surface, it’s a comedic look at human emotion, the complexity of a child growing up, and the delicate balance of family life. But by literally getting inside the head of 11-year-old Riley, the film finds a way to bring emotion to life in a way that is at once comedic, profound, and often ingenious.

The Beach Boys

“There’s definitely been ups and downs,” says singer/songwriter Mike Love in The Beach Boys. “We’ve probably been counted out half a dozen times.” Yet more than 60 years after the band’s founding, these California Dreamers have managed to defy audience expectations just as many times—and redefine what pop music can be in the process. Frank Marshall and Thom Zimny codirect this insightful documentary, which features brand-new interviews with Love, the late Brian Wilson, and Al Jardine—not to mention the many artists they have inspired (Lindsey Buckingham, Janelle Monae, Don Was, and Ryan Tedder among them).

Fantastic Mr. Fox

Wes Anderson assembled an all-star cast and crew for this gorgeous stop-motion animation adaptation of Roald Dahl’s children’s novel. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) makes a promise to his wife (Meryl Streep) that he’ll stop his farm-raiding ways when she reveals that she is pregnant. Years later, the crafty canine is feeling angsty and tempted to return to his criminal pastimes when temptation comes knocking right next door. But Mrs. Fox starts to suspect something is amiss when a bounty of fresh food starts finding its way into their home. Even worse, the local farmers are none too happy about being raided by a pesky fox—and band together to do something about it. Noah Baumbach cowrote the script with Anderson, and the cast includes many of Anderson’s most frequent collaborators, including Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Owen Wilson.

Jim Henson: Idea Man

Watching the trailer for Jim Henson: Idea Man, it strikes you: How has there not been an exhaustive documentary about Jim Henson before now? Muppets, The Dark Crystal, Sesame Street—the puppeteer had a hand in all of them. In this documentary, Ron Howard looks at Henson's (tireless) work, his incredible impact, and the legacy he left behind.

Let It Be

If Peter Jackson’s three-part 2021 docuseries Get Back (which is also on Disney+) left you wanting even more unfiltered access to the Beatles, we’ve got both good news and bad news: Let It Be is the 1970 documentary from which much of the footage seen within that series was taken. On the plus side, the original 16-mm print of the film—which has gone mostly unseen for the past 50 years—has undergone a painstaking restoration, courtesy of Jackson (yet again). While it lacks some of the emotional nuance of the series, as we see less of the sometimes-uncomfortable interactions of a band on the verge of their breaking point, it serves as a wonderful time capsule in which it was created. Feel free to pair the two together for one long binge (and throw in Abbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing for good measure).

Summer of Soul

Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson made his directorial debut with this feature documentary, which recounts the groundbreaking Harlem Cultural Festival—a six-week-long celebration of Black culture, including music, history, fashion, and beyond. The film features rarely-seen clips of performers such as Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Sly & the Family Stone. Why have you never heard of the event? Possibly because it was overshadowed by Woodstock, which took place during the same time in the summer of 1969. Ironically, when the film won the Oscar for Best Documentary at the 2022 Academy Awards, it was overshadowed yet again: It’s the award that was being handed out when Will Smith infamously slapped Chris Rock on the stage. (Here’s your chance to rectify missing that acceptance speech.)

Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version)

Were you one of the lucky ones who saw Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in person? Did you see Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour in theaters? Well guess what? You can now also watch it on Disney+! Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (Taylor's Version) is kind of like the one that played at AMC cinemas, but it's also got four new acoustic songs: “You Are in Love,” “Death by a Thousand Cuts,” “I Can See You,” and “Maroon.” It also features the folklore track “Cardigan.” So, whether you saw the tour, the movie theater experience—or neither—there's now yet another way to take in Taylor. Are you ready for it?

X-Men

Any property as beloved as X-Men is bound to have more than a few detractors when it makes the leap from page to screen. But the first X-Men movie managed to impress skeptical comic book fans and newcomers to the mutant war with its compelling storyline and stellar cast, which included Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, and then-newcomer Hugh Jackman. The film kicked off the first in an ever-growing franchise of the battle between mutants and humans, which now totals 13 films and more than $6 billion in box office receipts. With X-Men now officially part of Marvel Studios, expect to see lots more of this expanded cast of characters (beginning with the aforementioned Deadpool & Wolverine and 2026’s highly anticipated Avengers: Doomsday). Until then, though, go back and watch this 2000 classic, and prepare for the future.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny

It may be impossible to reach the heights achieved by timeless classics like Temple of Doom or Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this latest installment in the Indiana. Jones franchise puts the whip back in Harrison Ford’s hands, letting him fight Nazis and finally get (maybe) some closure to his artifact-hunting life. The movie, directed by James Mangold, also gets some fantastic humor and verve from Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who plays Helena, the daughter of an old ally of Indy’s who has perhaps less-than-pure interest in the Dial of Destiny, an ancient time-travel device that Dr. Jones, of course, thinks belongs in a museum.

Spider-Man: Far From Home

Far From Home, which stars Tom Holland as the Spandex-wearing superhero, is notable for being the first film in Phase Four of the MCU—and the first time we see an Avenger attempting to pick up the pieces following the events of Avengers: Endgame. For Peter Parker, that means taking a boring old class trip to Europe, which turns into anything but when Earth is attacked by a villainous group of Elementals, which Spidey can only fight with the help of the mysterious—and appropriately named—Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal).

Mrs. Doubtfire

Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is a lightly employed voice actor and devoted dad of three who has just been dumped by his wife and is only allowed to see his children one day per week. So he does what any rational person would do: asks his brother, who just happens to be a makeup artist, to dress him up as an older woman and applies to become a nanny working for his ex-wife Miranda (Sally Field). That Miranda doesn’t realize the person she has entrusted her children with is the man she was married to for more than a decade might speak more about her character. Ignore the ridiculous setup and instead enjoy more than two hours of Robin Williams going full Robin Williams. Bon appétit!

Big

Teenager Josh Baskin (David Moscow) wishes on a Zoltar machine that he could grow up overnight—and comes to find his older self (Tom Hanks) staring him back in the mirror the next morning. In an effort to hide his fast-forwarded body, Baskin hides out in New York City, where he falls backward into his dream job at a toy company and meets the woman of his dreams (Elizabeth Perkins). Big is the movie that made Tom Hanks, well, Tom Hanks (it also marked his first Oscar nomination). But it’s Robert De Niro who was originally set to star; when he was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, Hanks stepped in.

Finding Nemo

Nemo (Alexander Gould) is a young clown fish with an imperfect fin and a dad (Albert Brooks) who worries endlessly about his son’s safety. Which is forgivable, given that Nemo’s mom—and all his siblings—were victims of a barracuda shortly before their eggs hatched. So when Nemo is captured while the duo are swimming in the Great Barrier Reef, it’s up to Marlin to find and save his only son. With an all-star cast of voice actors—led by the always-perfect Brooks, and Ellen DeGeneres as a forgetful blue tang named Dory (who would go on to star in her own adventure)—Finding Nemo is part of the heyday of Pixar filmmaking where each film seemed to surpass the absolutely perfect one that preceded it.

The Princess Bride

Rob Reiner directs this adventure-comedy-fairytale, written by William Goldman (the legendary screenwriter who once famously said of Hollywood that “nobody knows anything”) from his own novel. The ever-quotable tale tells the story of a young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) who is engaged to marry a prince (Chris Sarandon) but is really in love with former farmhand Westley (Carey Elwes), who she believes was killed in a pirate attack. When Buttercup is kidnapped just days ahead of her wedding, a chain of events proceed to possibly reunite the in-love couple, or spell death for one (or both) of them. Goldman was famously critical of his own work, but didn’t mind taking credit for two of his movies. The Princess Bride was one of them (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was the other).

The Little Mermaid

Does the live-action version of The Little Mermaid improve upon the beloved 1989 animated classic? Of course not. But Disney is on a tear when it comes to reimagining the movies you loved as a kid, and this is one of the Mouse House’s better efforts. Oscar nominee Rob Marshall (Chicago, Mary Poppins Returns, Into the Woods) is behind the camera for this tale of a young mermaid who longs to be (sing it with us) “part of your world.” Yet it’s Halle Bailey, delivering a powerhouse performance as Ariel, who truly makes The Little Mermaid worth watching.

The Nightmare Before Christmas

Whether you think of Henry Selick’s imaginative stop-motion adventure as a Halloween film or a Christmas movie doesn’t really matter, as there’s never a bad time to add The Nightmare Before Christmas to your watch (or watch-again) list. When the mischief-makers in Halloweentown, including pumpkin king Jack Skellington, discover the magic of Christmas, they decide to kidnap Santa Claus and claim both holidays for themselves. Even in today’s CGI-soaked world, the artistry behind The Nightmare Before Christmas remains painfully impressive—and the macabre yet kid-friendly tone makes it a fun watch for the entire family. There’s also a sing-along version if you’re in the mood.

Cinderella

In case you don’t know the story: After Cinderella loses her beloved mother, her father marries a nasty woman with two equally nasty daughters. While they spend their days tormenting the kind-hearted Cinderella, Prince Charming, the most eligible bachelor in all the land, only has eyes for her. Seventy-five years after its original release, Cinderella remains a Disney classic for a reason. Now it’s back with an impressive 4K restoration that has been several years in the making.

Avatar: The Way of Water

One week before Avatar hit theaters (for the first time) in late 2009, James Cameron announced his intention to turn the movie into a full-on franchise. But the director took his sweet time in following through. Avatar: The Way of Water—which checks in on blue lovebirds Jake (Sam Worthington) and Neytiri (Zoe Saldaña), now married with children—was released in late 2022, a full 13 years after the original made its debut. But Cameron smartly bought himself some time by setting the film 16 years after the events of Avatar. And while the critical reviews were mixed, it still ended up becoming the third-highest-grossing movie of all time, proving yet again that Cameron has some sort of Midas touch at the box office. We’ll see if that still holds true when the franchise’s third film, Avatar: Fire and Ash, arrives in December.

The Incredible Hulk

To Marvel fans, Mark Ruffalo is the only Bruce Banner. But that’s only after Eric Bana tried on the supersized superhero’s tiny purple pants in 2003’s Hulk—and then passed them on to Edward Norton for this 2008 flick, which had the misfortune of hitting theaters just one month after Iron Man. The MCU has always had a messy timeline, but audiences shouldn’t be too quick to write this movie off, particularly those looking to kick back with a solid summer popcorn flick. Norton may lack Ruffalo’s effortless charm, but he’s got the Doc Green part of the character down. While the movie has been largely (and wrongly) forgotten, it did get a bump in February when Liv Tyler found her way into (the new) Bruce's arms when she reprised her roles as love interest Betty Ross in Captain America: Brave New World.

The Skeleton Dance

Fans of classic animation will love every second of the more than two dozen freshly restored old shorts that are part of the Disney+ library. One of the most exciting titles among them is The Skeleton Dance, which revolutionized cartoon culture in 1929. Walt Disney himself wrote, directed, and produced this macabre comedy in which a group of resurrected skeletons rise from their graves and, yep, dance. This is actually much funnier and/or more impressive than it sounds.

Stan Lee

Easily the most recognizable name in comics, Stan Lee has had an impact on the medium—and on pop culture broadly—that simply can’t be overstated. Director David Gelb’s documentary about “The Man” delves into not only his legacy, but also his history. Tracing the comics maestro’s life from his early years in New York City to his work cocreating iconic characters like Spider-Man and Black Panther to his time as everyone’s favorite Marvel movie cameo, Stan Lee is essential viewing for any fan.

Spider-Man

While Sam Raimi’s Tobey Maguire-starring Spider-Man movies predate the official MCU, the famed director really set the stage for what that future universe would look like, with its mix of solid storytelling, genuine laughs, and impressive visuals. Maguire is perfectly cast as the awkwardly charming Peter Parker, who—having just discovered his superhero powers—is learning to harness them.

Venom

Venom may not have been a hit with critics, but WIRED senior editor Angela Watercutter nailed exactly what the movie was when she called it “a bad movie with great cult-movie potential.” While it rivals Doctor Strange for its stacked cast of serious talent—Tom Hardy in the lead, with Michelle Williams and Riz Ahmed costarring, plus Zombieland’s Reuben Fleischer as director—the end result was, well, a bit of a jumbled mess. Nonetheless, it somehow manages to be compelling, even if you just turn it on to watch Hardy mumble, eat Tater Tots, and almost literally chew scenery for 112 minutes.

The Original Star Wars Trilogy

Naturally, Star Wars is one of the big attractions on Disney+. And it goes without saying, or at least it should, that the films that comprise the original trilogy are the best of the bunch—and the only Star Wars movies you should watch if you’re opting not to binge all dozen or so features. The caveat for pickier fans is that these are the versions that have been messed with by George Lucas post-release. Some things, like the improved visuals in and around Cloud City, are thoughtful additions, but others are more controversial.

The Star Wars Prequel Trilogy

More than 20 years after Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope (aka simply Star Wars) helped to define the Hollywood blockbuster, George Lucas returned to the space opera well with an all-new trilogy for an all-new generation of moviegoers. It went about as well as you’d expect. We won’t pretend that The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and/or Revenge of the Sith (2005) have even an ounce of the heart, humor, or heroism of the original films. But they’ve become essential pop culture viewing, and a rite of passage for sci-fi fans, if only to get what all the Jar Jar Binks hate is about.

The Star Wars Sequel Trilogy

When Disney purchased Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012, it was essentially George Lucas handing over the keys to the Millennium Falcon. While fans were rightly skeptical about whether the Mouse House would be able—or even want—to recapture the slightly countercultural environment in which the series was originally created, one hopeful thought united them all: Whatever Disney concocted could not be worse than the Prequel Trilogy. And they were right. By giving the reins to J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens), Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi), then Abrams once again (The Rise of Skywalker), the series became more of a love letter to the original films and the generations of filmmakers—and fans—they inspired. Happily, actors Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver proved worthy successors to the smugglers, scavengers, Jedi masters, and Sith Lords who preceded them.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever

As WIRED senior writer Jason Parham wrote in his review of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, this movie is haunted by the absence of Chadwick Boseman, the Marvel Cinematic Universe's original King T’Challa who died following a battle with colon cancer in 2020. To that end, writer-director Ryan Coogler had to make a much different kind of superhero film, one that addressed the loss of its main character while also pushing Marvel's cinematic storyline forward into its next phase. “It's rare for MCU films to channel the turbulence of grief with such unflinching focus,” Parham wrote. “Coogler has equipped his sequel with a changed vocabulary: It speaks equally from a place of loss as it does triumph. Grief is its mother tongue.” To that end, the director uses the death of T'Challa to usher in a new Black Panther as well as new heroes (Ironheart) and adversaries-turned-allies (Namor).

Turning Red

Mei Lee is a 13-year-old with a problem: Whenever she’s overcome with any sort of overwhelming emotion, which is just about every emotion at that age, she transforms into a giant red panda. Eventually, Mei comes to learn that it’s an inherited family trait. And while there are people who would like to exploit her supernatural powers, she slowly learns that only she has the power to control them. Think of this as a spiritual sequel to 2015’s Inside Out, which explored the complex inner workings of an 11-year-old’s constantly changing emotions.

Abbey Road: If These Walls Could Sing

Abbey Road Studios is best known as the place where the Beatles recorded some of their most iconic albums, including 1969’s Abbey Road. But the hallowed halls of this legendary music studio have played a much bigger role in the music industry, as it has hosted the likes of everyone from Elton John, Pink Floyd, and Aretha Franklin to Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Radiohead, Adele, Oasis, Kate Bush, and Frank Ocean. This documentary, which arrived on the heels of Peter Jackson’s docuseries The Beatles: Get Back (which is also streaming on Disney+ and is highly recommended), is directed by Mary McCartney—daughter of Sir Paul—who practically grew up in the studio and, as such, is able to treat her subject with the reverence it deserves.

Avatar

James Cameron’s Avatar was all anyone could talk about when it was released in theaters in 2009 and promptly went on to make more than $1 billion, becoming the cinematic iceberg that sank another Cameron epic, 1997’s Titanic, from its place as the highest-grossing movie of all time. For a movie that made so much bank, however, it never occupied a huge space in the cultural conversation about movies. Like so many of Cameron’s works, much of its innovation came from the technology that essentially had to be invented to make it possible.

Iron Man

The MCU has released nearly three dozen films since 2008, yet the very first of them—Iron Man—remains one of the best. It’s almost impossible to believe how hard director Jon Favreau had to fight to get Robert Downey Jr. the leading role, as he’s arguably one of the MCU’s most beloved figures. Before there was a whole franchise plus a shared TV universe, Downey, as Tony Stark/Iron Man, was just allowed to do his thing. It was a gamble that paid off for all involved.

West Side Story

From Martin Scorsese to Spike Lee, pretty much every great director has made—or at least tried to make—a grand Hollywood musical, perhaps one of the toughest genres to successfully pull off. Steven Spielberg made the task even more difficult when he decided to adapt Jerome Robbins, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, and ​​Arthur Laurents’ West Side Story—which Robert Wise already did to great acclaim in 1961. But, Spielberg (being Spielberg) managed to create an updated take on the story of Tony (Ansel Elgort) and Maria (Rachel Zegler), two love-struck teens caught in the middle of an escalating rivalry between two street gangs, the Sharks and the Jets. The update gives nods to the original (like casting Rita Moreno, who won an Oscar for her role as Anita in Wise’s film) while improving on some of its controversial aspects (like casting Natalie Wood in the role of a Puerto Rican teen).

Lady and the Tramp

Sure, you can watch the live-action/CGI version that Disney+ released shortly after it launched, but why bother when the 1955 original is here too? Put aside the rather vulgar stereotypes that were common at the time (the movie now comes with a warning, though it was recently reworded) and Lady and the Tramp remains one of the most iconic Disney animations, and a love story for the ages. When a spoiled cocker spaniel named Lady finds herself competing with a new baby for the attention of her parents, she ends up getting loose and befriending a mangy but charming mutt named Tramp. Ultimately, Lady needs to choose between the pampered life she’s always known with Jim Dear and Darling, or a life of spaghetti dinner discards with the hopelessly romantic Tramp—unless there’s another way.

The Muppet Movie

Between The Muppet Show and The Muppet Movie, Jim Henson and the Muppets were everywhere in 1979. Their first big-screen outing serves as more of a prequel, as it follows Kermit the Frog’s journey from a swamp in Florida to Hollywood, where he’s headed to pursue his dreams of becoming a movie star. Along the way, we get to witness where and how he meets the fellow members of his felt-made crew, from Fozzie Bear to Miss Piggy. Hijinks ensue when a restaurateur named Doc Hopper doesn’t take too kindly to Kermit turning down his offer to serve as the official legs of his chain’s famous fried frog legs, and follows the frog in order to seek revenge.

Luca

Enrico Casarosa’s Luca earned an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature in 2022 for its sweet and soulful story about a young boy named Luca who is hiding a dark secret: He's a sea monster living in a town on the Italian Riviera that absolutely despises his kind. Ultimately, Luca is a moving coming-of-age film about friendship, family, and overcoming our own prejudices—and truly one of Pixar’s best features.

Captain Marvel

Marvel's biggest mistake in the entire MCU canon (so far) was not commissioning Captain Marvel sooner. The film, set in the past, sees the rise of Marvel (Brie Larson) as she discovers her origin story and develops her powers. The film, the first entry in the Marvel universe with a female lead, channels the spirit of the 1990s both in its setting and in style, with heaping spoonfuls of Samuel L. Jackson and all the plot and subtlety of a blockbuster action movie. Larson adds a healthy dose of sarcasm to undercut her character’s immense power, and Jackson is eerily brilliant, making for a super fun 123 minutes.

Ant-Man

Who doesn’t love a heist movie? Paul Rudd’s MCU debut acted as something of a palate cleanser after the heavy, literally Earth-shattering events of Age of Ultron. Rudd plays Scott Lang, a reformed criminal who teams up with Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter (Evangeline Lily) to keep Pym’s shrinking technology from falling into the wrong hands. The film’s depiction of quantum physics wouldn’t hold much water at CERN, but it’s terrific fun—thanks in part to Michael Peña’s star turn as Lang’s former cellmate Luis and, of course, Rudd’s legendary likability. If you want to make it a Rudd-athon, both Ant-Man and the Wasp and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania are streaming, too.

Mulan

In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and its shutdown of almost the entire movie industry, Disney decided to try something new with its live-action version of Mulan by making it available to Disney+ subscribers instead of releasing it in theaters. The film itself is one of the latest in Disney’s recent string of live-action remakes and sees Liu Yifei in the title role, with reviews praising the cast, visuals, and action sequences.

Avengers: Endgame

There's a moment in the event-movie-to-endgame-all-event-movies when you realize that writers Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus have gone full Harry Potter and the Cursed Child all over the MCU. Once you get past the rather glum beginning, you can settle in for what you have come to expect from any Avengers movie: Tony Stark cracking wise; Doctor Strange doing weird things with his hands; Professor Hulk explaining the science of what’s going on; and Black Widow and Captain Marvel kicking ass, both emotionally and physically. It's a messy but epic baton-pass in the form of an angsty portal-powered mega-battle. And we're not going to lie: We've watched those audience reaction videos, and they too are a thing of joy.

Hamilton

If you only know Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical from the obscenely high ticket prices and snippets of the soundtrack, here’s your chance to find out what all the fuss is about. A version of the production, recorded via a six-camera setup over two performances by the original Broadway cast, was put on Disney+ after plans to release it in cinemas were scrapped. Aside from a couple of censored swear words and the fact that it's directed (by Thomas Kail), it's essentially the same show—an energetic, empathetic, witty, quippy hip-hop musical about US founding father Alexander Hamilton.

Moana

One of the potential answers to “What, oh, what to put on after Frozen and Frozen 2?” Moana is in fact better than Frozen. By that we simply mean better soundtrack, better heroine, better visuals, and better side quests. There's also 100 percent more Dwayne Johnson as a tattooed demigod and Jemaine Clement as a giant crab doing a Bowie impression. Set thousands of years ago on the fictional, Polynesia-inspired island of Motunui, Moana's hero's journey is fairly classic, but the sumptuous animation and Lin-Manuel Miranda tunes are top-tier Disney. (Sure, we'd love to see Taika Waititi's original script, but we can live without it.) Moana 2, last year’s less well-received sequel, is now also streaming on Disney+ (as are sing-along versions for both films).

Free Solo

If your friend told you they'd decided to solo-climb up the sheer 3,000-foot granite El Capitan wall in Yosemite, California, with no rope, you’d think they had gone mad. But that’s exactly what Alex Honnold set out to do back in 2017. Honnold’s quest to climb the vertical wall was documented by his two director friends, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, as he took on the ascent to become the world’s first person to free-climb El Capitan. But it’s not just about the ascent, it’s also about Honnold’s complicated life, his emotional issues, and all the things that have driven him to pursue one of the most dangerous missions ever attempted by any free climber. The cinematography in Free Solo is also dizzyingly beautiful, and the entire thing will have you gripping the arm of your chair in terror.

Honey, I Shrunk the Kids

Wayne Szalinski (Rick Moranis) is an experimental inventor who creates an electromagnetic shrinking machine. Naturally, he accidentally shrinks his own children (if you didn’t already guess that from the title), plus the kids from next door, then unwittingly throws them in the trash. To have any chance of becoming their normal size again, the teeny tots must navigate their way across the family's (now seemingly gigantic) yard and back to the house. It's something fraught with peril when you're half the size of an aspirin.

Toy Story (All of Them)

While it initially might have seemed as if Pixar could never make anything as good as the original 1995 Toy Story, each of the three subsequent films add depth to the franchise's canon. All of the movies are critically acclaimed—and they're all available on Disney+. When combined, the four films tell a story about growing up and how everything in life, inevitably, changes. Woody (Tom Hanks) and the gang go from learning how to deal with new people to understanding loss. It's something that's also followed the cast: In Toy Story 4, the voice of Mr. Potato Head was created through archive recordings after Don Rickles, as the man behind the voice, died ahead of the film's release.

The Lion King

Remember the terrifying wildebeest stampede in the 1994 version of The Lion King? That was actually computer animated, because drawing them by hand would have taken a long, long time. Special attention was taken to blend it into the cel-shaded backgrounds, and this was all before Toy Story came out the following year. Which is all to say that not only is the '90s version a perfect movie that had absolutely zero need for a charm-deficient 2019 remake (which is also streaming on Disney+ in case you want to compare), it’s also the best Lion King to use CG animation.

10 Things I Hate About You

Heath Ledger singing “Can’t Take My Eyes off You” on the bleachers. That’s the iconic scene in this top-caliber high school romcom. The plot is taken from The Taming of the Shrew, the cast—including Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt—are all adorable, and the late '90s nostalgia is potent. Offering some much-needed variety from the sci-fi and animation that dominates the Disney+ launch catalog, 10 Things I Hate About You is as good as comfort-food movies get.

Tron & Tron: Legacy

Tron and its modern sequel, Tron: Legacy, aren't your typical Disney films. The original sees a programmer (Jeff Bridges) become trapped inside a computer system where he meets and befriends programs, including the eponymous hero Tron, who are resisting the power of a growing artificial intelligence, the Master Control Program. It became a sci-fi cult classic, leading to the creation of a modern sequel that continues the story and features an epic score cowritten by Daft Punk. Both are watchable distractions, even if the sequel feels a little thin in places.

Willow

Another nostalgia fest, this time for fans of '80s fantasy. Willow is a family-friendly, mythic quest that’s best seen as George Lucas and Ron Howard’s fun, $35 million Tolkien fan fiction. The story of a farmer tasked with protecting a magic baby from an evil queen is not exactly the most original story in the world, but that hasn’t stopped this from becoming a classic, with Warwick Davis as Willow Ufgood and Val Kilmer waving a sword around. Classic Sunday afternoon fare.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier

Winter Soldier is among the best Marvel movies. It makes time for quieter character moments, and the action, while still spectacular, feels a little more grounded and real than the CGI-fueled shock and awe of the mainline movies. In this outing, Captain America faces off against a rogue element of SHIELD led by Robert Redford's Alexander Pierce.

Thor: Ragnarok

The first two Thor films were among the worst in the whole series—Chris Hemsworth’s thunder god was dour and charmless. But here, director Taika Waititi injected some much-needed color into the proceedings, borrowing heavily from the Planet Hulk storyline from the comics. Thor finds himself stranded on a bizarre planet, ruled over by Jeff Goldblum (who is pretty much playing himself). There, he crosses paths with Bruce Banner’s Hulk, who has been missing since the events of Civil War. It’s hugely funny, and arguably the best film of the series.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story

The newer Star Wars one-off films attract strong opinions, and Rogue One is no different. But while it has its issues, it fills an important hole in the universe and features some of the best action sequences in the entire saga. Its main black mark is the rather iffy CGI recreation of Peter Cushing's Grand Moff Tarkin, but it's still a fun romp that lacks the narrative baggage of the new trilogy.

Black Panther

Black Panther had a huge cultural impact. It was refreshingly unusual to see a blockbuster superhero film with such a diverse cast—and the Afrofuturist setting was unlike anything Marvel had ever done before. Michael B. Jordan steals the show as Killmonger, who returns to his father’s home to claim the throne from T’Challa (the late Chadwick Boseman).

WALL·E

Released in 2008, a time when, for many, the climate crisis felt like a distant, abstract threat, WALL·E is classic Pixar. It’s a love story—sort of—that focuses on two robots. But it’s also a story about survival, believing in yourself, and dancing through the vacuum of space propelled by a fire extinguisher. The animation, especially on the desolate, barren Earth, is a sight to behold. The opening scenes of the film are also basically a silent film, with the score and robotic sound effects doing a fantastic job bringing out the emotion and drama of what’s happening.

Up

Pixar's Up can claim one of the most moving opening scenes of any movie. Despite being released more than a decade ago, in 2009, the animation hasn't aged or lost any of its charm. In a little over 90 minutes, director Pete Docter takes us on the journey of Carl, an old widower who is seeking out Paradise Falls. Carl's trip in his flying house is made in memory of his wife, Ellie, who had always wanted to visit the falls. The film won two Oscars—Best Animated Feature and Best Original Score—but was also nominated for three more. These included Best Picture, which at the time made it only the second animated film to have received the nomination (1991’s Beauty and the Beast—which is also streaming on Disney+, and most definitely worth a rewatch—was the first).

The Jungle Book

Whatever mood you're in, Disney+ has The Jungle Book to suit it. The streaming service has both the 1967 animated classic, with its catchy soundtrack and moments of humor, plus the live-action version released in 2016. The two films couldn't be more different. If you want to go for full family entertainment, pick the original, but if you're after something a little darker, the modern remake is where you should head. (Bonus fact: The entire live-action film was shot in a warehouse.)

Guardians of the Galaxy

The first volume of Guardians of the Galaxy didn't burst into the MCU until 2014, which is relatively late considering Phase One began with Iron Man in 2008. However, it's become a firm fan favorite, providing some of the Universe's most memorable (and important) characters. Quill, Rocket, Groot, Gamora, and Nebula are all distinctive and in many ways more likable than other key MCU characters. Guardians is worth returning to if you want to remember a slightly simpler time before Thanos' Snap.",,"Jennifer M.

Eyes of Wakanda

Disney is betting big on the Black Panther universe. Just one month after the premiere of the new live-action series Ironheart (see below) comes this new animated anthology series that delves even further into the Wakanda mythology. Two-time Oscar nominee Ryan Coogler—the man behind both Black Panther movies—developed this four-episode prequel in which the Hatut Zaraze, aka Wakanda’s “War Dogs,” embark on adventure-filled missions to retrieve long-lost Vibranium artifacts.

Ironheart

Ryan Coogler is responsible for what is arguably the best movie in the MCU (2018’s Black Panther), and now he’s executive producing one of its most interesting small-screen endeavors. Playwright Chinaka Hodge created this series, which picks up right after the events featured in 2022’s Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It stars Dominique Thorne, who reprises her role as Riri Williams, aka Ironheart, a brilliant MIT student who has successfully managed to create a Tony Stark–like suit of armor. It gives her the kind of invincibility that changes her outlook on the world—and leads her down a pothole-filled path that could see her heroic character go the way of the antihero in a way that critics have described as being similar to The Sopranos’ Tony Soprano and Breaking Bad’s Walter White.

Underdogs

Ryan Reynolds brings his penchant for turning genres on their heads to National Geographic with a brand-new kind of nature special. The Deadpool star narrates and serves as executive producer on this fun docuseries which puts the spotlight on the “underdogs” of the animal kingdom—those creatures and critters who don’t always warrant the same amount of respect as the kings and queens they share real estate with. Or, as Reynolds calls them, the “super zeroes.”

Doctor Who

Spring 2024 marked the beginning of a new era for Doctor Who fans when Ncuti Gatwa was officially handed the sonic screwdriver to take the legendary sci-fi series in new directions as the Fifteenth Doctor. He did it all over again with a second season, which aired a game-changing finale on May 31 that has viewers wondering where the Doctor will be headed next. Russell T. Davies is also back to oversee all the time-traveling shenanigans as the latest incarnation of the Time Lord journeys through space and time with companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), and new addition Belinda Chandra (Varada Sethu). While the series will keep its standing as a BBC staple in the UK and Ireland, American audiences will need to head to Disney+ to experience it all.

Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld

There are two types of people in this world: those who think there are more Star Wars movies and TV shows that one person needs and those who are counting down the days until The Mandalorian & Grogu arrives in theaters next year. If you’re part of that latter group, you’re in good company—and have plenty of series to choose from, including this six-part anthology that follows 2022’s Tales of the Jedi and last year’s Tales of the Empire (see below). In true Star Wars style, it tells the story of two villains, former assassin/bounty hunter Asajj Ventress and outlaw Cad Bane, who form an unlikely alliance in an attempt to build new lives for themselves, until Bane catches up with an old colleague, who has switched sides to become a law-abiding marshal. Dark versus light battle it out once more.

Andor

Andor, which just scored 14 Emmy nominations, including one for Outstanding Drama Series, is something of a miracle. Created by Tony Gilroy, the two-time Oscar nominee behind Michael Clayton and a writer on the Bourne movies, it’s the origin story of one of Rogue One's most beloved characters, Cassian Andor (Diego Luna). Set in the early years of the Rebellion, it charts Andor’s path to becoming one of the most integral of the Rebels. With a supporting cast that includes Fiona Shaw and Stellan Skarsgård, it features a fantastic score from Nicholas Britell (Moonlight, Succession). After spending so much time with Mandalorians and Jedis, it’s a welcome reprieve and perhaps the closest thing to prestige TV the Star Wars universe has released.

Oklahoma City Bombing: One Day in America

Thirty years after the Oklahoma City Bombing, Nat Geo takes a look back at the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in US history. The three-part docuseries features rarely seen archival footage and interviews with survivors who are sharing their harrowing stories for the first time. While it’s undoubtedly a tragic story, the series also recounts the inspiring way in which it united Americans.

Daredevil: Born Again

Daredevil fans were devastated when the original Netflix series was canceled in 2018, but Charlie Cox never strayed far from his title role for too long. He popped up as Matt Murdock/Daredevil in MCU movies (Spider-Man: No Way Home) and TV shows (She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, Echo, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man), all the while biding his time until his eponymous series came back. Seven years and one massive overhaul later, fans seem to think it was worth the wait. Born Again sees Cox facing off against crime lord turned mayoral candidate Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) once more. There’s also a darkness to the series that seems to borrow a page from Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight playbook, though it’s not as elegant in its execution. Still, it’s a solid crime drama that sets itself apart from many other MCU series thanks to its more mature tone. Whether you were into the Netflix series or not, it might be time to dig in.

Win or Lose

Will Forte, Rhea Seehorn, Ian Chen, Melissa Villaseñor, and Izaac Wang are among the dozens of actors and comedians who lend their voices to Pixar’s very first original animated series. Over the course of eight episodes, this charming series plays out the same events that occur in the week leading up to a middle school softball team’s championship game from the perspective of various characters, including a wise bead of sweat known as Sweaty (and voiced by comedian Jo Firestone). If the title sounds familiar to you, it might be because the series created some controversy back in December when it was revealed that a transgender character’s storyline had been cut from the series. Disney’s reasoning? “When it comes to animated content for a younger audience, we recognize that many parents would prefer to discuss certain subjects with their children on their own terms and timeline.”

Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man

Four years after it was first announced, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man arrived early this year. The animated series dares to imagine what kind of chaos might have ensued if Peter Parker (Hudson Thames) had been mentored by baddie Norman Osborn/Green Goblin (Colman Domingo) instead of Tony Stark/Iron Man. Oh, the horror (and fun)! A second season has already been confirmed, though likely won’t premiere until 2026.

Goosebumps: The Vanishing

For more than 30 years, R. L. Stine’s Goosebumps books have fed the nightmares of young readers—much to their delight (well, usually). Now Disney is inspiring a whole new generation of horror lovers with this fun series, which follows the lives of a group of high schoolers who begin to unravel the terrifying truth about a decades-old murder—and the roles their nearest and dearest might have played in it—in their otherwise picture-perfect hometown. The always-affable Justin Long starred as a teacher who may or may not be possessed in season 1 of this anthology series. Its second, and final, season brought an extended title (Goosebumps: The Vanishing), a new cast (including Friends star David Schwimmer), and a whole new set of nightmares.

Star Wars: Skeleton Crew

Do you love Star Wars but wish it had more Warriors/The Wizard of Oz/The Brave Little Toaster energy? Lucasfilm has heard your cries and is here to oblige. For Skeleton Crew, they assembled a gang of four youths who get lost in the Star Wars universe and try to find their way home with the help of Jude Law, who plays an “enigmatic scoundrel"" named Jod. OK, so Star Wars probably already has enough of those, but who cares? The real treasure is the friends you'll make along the way.

Luther

Add DCI John Luther (Idris Elba) to the long list of “conflicted cops who mean well.” It's a character archetype that TV viewers have seen dozens of times before, but few actors take it to the level that Elba does. Forget bending the rules—Luther dismantles them and has no regrets. Planting evidence? Killing a criminal? Buddying up to a homicidal sociopath who can take the real “bad guys” out on your behalf? Luther has seen and done it all in the name of justice. Somehow it’s hard not to root for him at every turn.

Lego Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy

Sig Greebling (Stranger Things’ Gaten Matarazzo) discovers an ancient relic that alters the history of the universe—turning Jar Jar Binks into a lightsaber-wielding Sith and Luke Skywalker into Just Some Guy. With the help of a wise old Jedi, Sig must do what he can to piece things back together. Sure, the plotline has all the makings of a typical Star Wars story, but with Mark Hamill and Ahmed Best lending their voices to the minifig versions of the characters that made them famous, it also does so in a way that pokes just the right amount of fun at the canon.

Agatha All Along

After Kathryn Hahn became the (not-so-surprising) breakout star of 2021’s WandaVision miniseries (more on that below), MCU fans were thrilled—but, again, not surprised—when she nabbed her own series with Agatha All Along. The long-awaited spinoff takes place three years after the events of WandaVision, with witch Agatha (now stripped of all her magical powers) enlisting a teenager (Joe Locke) and a new coven to help her regain her status as HWIC. Aubrey Plaza, Patti LuPone, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp round out the stellar cast.

Bluey

Yes, Bluey is technically a children’s show. But everyone is welcome to enjoy this animated series from Australia, which centers around an endlessly curious blue heeler pup named Bluey and her family (mom, dad, and little sister). The show’s brevity—each episode clocks in at around eight minutes, and there are also mini episodes that are half that run time—is part of what makes it such a fun and easy watch. But the exploration of everyday feelings and emotions that everyone can relate to (humans, too) have made it a bona fide cultural phenomenon. Rose Byrne, Natalie Portman, and Eva Mendes are among the stars who have lent their voices to the show.

Arctic Ascent With Alex Honnold

In Free Solo (which is also streaming on Disney+), climber Alex Honnold dared to do the unthinkable, becoming the first person to free solo climb the 3,000-foot rock wall of Yosemite’s El Capitan. For most people, that dauntless endeavor would have been enough adventure for one lifetime. But Alex Honnold is not most people, as this three-part National Geographic docuseries makes clear. Here, he travels to Greenland with fellow climbers to conquer more unclimbed spaces in one of the most remote corners of the world. Vicarious anxiety never felt so exciting.

Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures

If helping to raise a new generation of Star Wars geeks was even a small part of your reason for having kids, this animated series, which is basically the Star Wars version of Muppet Babies, is a great place to start their education. Set during the High Republic era, approximately 200 years before the events of The Phantom Menace, it follows a group of young Jedis—Jedi Lites—who are sometimes stumbling their way through learning the ways of the Force. Like any good kid series, it also teaches important lessons about life and making a positive difference in the world.

The Acolyte

A Jedi turning to the Dark Side is a concept as old as the Star Wars franchise itself, and not something fans have given much thought to in terms of the “why.” But this Disney+ series dares to ask that question, and plays out a bit like a true crime procedural in a sci-fi landscape. Carrie-Anne Moss stars as a Jedi Master, and if her character seems a bit like Trinity from The Matrix series, that’s by design. Series creator Leslye Headland told Empire that the character owes much of its inspiration to the Wachowskis’ movies and that Moss’ Indara is basically “Trinity with a lightsaber.” In August, Disney announced that one season is all we’re going to get of The Acolyte, so savor all eight episodes.

Star Wars: Tales of the Empire

It’s been more than five years since Disney released the last Star Wars movie, and The Mandalorian & Grogu won't arrive until May 22, 2026. Fortunately, Disney+ has plenty of TV series to fill the void, including this animated anthology that adds new stories about the franchise’s Galactic empire, in the same time period in which the original trilogy existed. It follows the very different journeys of two characters: Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto), a Force-sensitive human and member of the Nightsister coven who, after being one of the few of her people to survive the Clone Wars, is seeking revenge. Meanwhile, Barriss Offee (Meredith Salenger) is a former Jedi who is questioning her own disillusionment with the order and what her road ahead looks like. Both are forced to make decisions that will change their individual destinies, and the galaxy far, far away with it.

X-Men '97

Of all the big-budget X-Men movies and TV shows that have existed over the years, it’s hard to believe that a cartoon series from the ’90s is one of the most beloved entries. But it’s true—and has a near-perfect Rotten Tomatoes score to prove it. When the revival arrived in 2024, many of the original voice actors returned to reclaim their characters, who must learn how to navigate a world without Professor Xavier to guide them. The events of this series pick up just one year after the point where the original show (which you can read more about below) ended.

Renegade Nell

Louisa Harland shines as Nell Jackson, the renegade of the title, who accidentally becomes one of the most feared highwaywomen in 18th-century England after she is framed for murder. Of course, this being a Disney series, it’s best to expect something a little magical—which in Nell’s case is Billy Blind, a magical sprite sent to help her realize her true destiny. What is surprising is that the series, which is perfectly suited to teens and their families, was created by Sally Wainwright, the brilliant mind behind such adult-themed series as Happy Valley and Gentleman Jack.

Dinosaurs

Nineties kids no doubt remember this sitcom about a family of dinosaurs. Earl Sinclair is a fortysomething megalosaurus living with his family in Pangaea circa 60,000,000 BC. While his days are spent working as a tree pusher (yep, he pushes over trees), he lives for his family: wife Fran and kids Robbie, Charlene, and Baby Sinclair, whose running gag of hitting his dad over the head with a frying pan and shouting “Gotta love me!” never gets old. Not even three decades on.

Echo

This Marvel series continues the studio’s recent trend of shining a spotlight on its fearless—and complicated—female characters. In this case, that character is Maya Lopez (Alaqua Cox), aka Echo, who is best known to audiences as a baddie from Hawkeye. But over the course of its relatively short five episodes, we learn why Maya—one of the MCU’s few deaf characters—must reconcile the events of her past and reconnect with her Native American roots in order to confront the future she has created for herself. Cox may be a relative newcomer to Hollywood, but she deftly manages to shoulder the weight of an entire MCU series.

Percy Jackson and the Olympians

Nearly 20 years after the release of the first book in Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series, this small-screen adaptation of that first title is being praised for how faithful it has remained to Riordan’s beloved words. Being a tween is hard enough, but for 12-year-old Perseus “Percy” Jackson (Walker Scobell) it gets even harder when he learns he's the son of Poseidon, god of the sea, and that he has pissed off his uncle, Zeus, who believes that Percy has stolen his thunderbolt. (And you thought having a zit was bad!) Fortunately for Percy there is Camp Half-Blood—a place where demigods like himself can learn to harness their powers and use them for good. It’s there that Percy learns the whole “with great power comes great responsibility” thing and embraces it—even if he'd rather be playing video games with his friends. A second season is set to arrive in December, with Season 3 already in the works.

Behind the Attraction

Disneyland, Walt Disney’s very first theme park, opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955. In the 70 years since, Disney parks have become a worldwide phenomenon and inspired rabid fan bases who make annual (if not more frequent) pilgrimages to these so-called Happiest Places on Earth. But what goes on behind the scenes? From the creation of major attractions like the Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean to its bustling food scene (Dole Whip, anyone?), this docuseries goes behind the scenes of the world’s most famous amusement parks.

Loki

The MCU is exhaustingly huge. Yet while Loki is undoubtedly part of that universe, the series could just as easily work as a stand-alone piece, and it's all the more fun and surprising as a result. There are enough plot twists, silly one-liners, and time-travel antics to keep everyone entertained, and even a wisecracking alligator. If that doesn’t do it, Loki has a visual effects budget that would put most Hollywood blockbusters to shame. Sure, it’s not the most intellectually stimulating show out there, but Tom Hiddleston does a great job of turning Loki into a fairly complex, interesting character. No word yet on whether there might be a third season in Loki’s future—and even Hiddleston is in the dark. “I truly don’t know,” he admitted to Variety in 2024, adding: “There have been other times when I thought that it was the end and I have been mistaken. But if this is the end, I'm so proud of where we ended up.”

Daredevil

Before Disney+ became the home for all of Marvel’s TV content, Netflix was the place to find it—beginning with Daredevil, in which blind attorney Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) spends his days seeking justice and his nights looking for revenge as a masked vigilante attempting to rid his Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of its criminal element. While the series ended in 2018, Cox has reprised his role for a new series, Daredevil: Born Again, which arrived in early March (see above).

Ahsoka

We know what you’re thinking: Wait, another Star Wars series? And we don’t blame you for asking the question. But for old-school franchise fans, Ahsoka just might surprise you. Rosario Dawson reprises the title role as Ahsoka Tano, a former Jedi who studied under Anakin Skywalker, which she first played in season 2 of The Mandalorian. Here, Ahsoka sets off on a journey to locate Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen, Mads’ brother)—a master manipulator who seems to be on a mission to become the grand ruler of the galaxy. A second season is scheduled to begin production in April, and will welcome Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker back into the Star Wars fold.

The Wonder Years

In 2021, writer-producer Saladin K. Patterson (Frasier, The Bernie Mac Show) rebooted the award-winning, and much beloved, series The Wonder Years for a new generation. Don Cheadle narrates the adventures of Dean Williams (Elisha “EJ” Williams), as he comes of age in Montgomery, Alabama, in the final years of the Civil Rights Movement. Both seasons of the worthwhile series are now streaming—as are all six seasons of the original series, which premiered in 1988.

Kizazi Moto: Generation Fire

While Black Panther may have gotten an official sequel with 2022’s Wakanda Forever (which is, of course, available to stream on Disney+), this animated anthology series is in many ways a spiritual successor to that Oscar-winning MCU flick. More than a dozen up-and-coming African storytellers were handpicked to write and/or direct these 10 short films, which build on the makers’ cultures and histories to paint a fascinating, gorgeously animated—and often dystopian—picture of Afrofuturism.

American Born Chinese

Oscar winners—and Everything Everywhere All at Once costars—Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan reunite for this Disney+ original series. Jin Wang (Ben Wang) is your typical teenager who’s just trying to get through the day of dealing with high school social hierarchies. But his life is forever altered when he’s asked to serve as a mentor to Wei-Chen (Jimmy Liu), a foreign exchange student who is hiding some pretty big secrets. Like that he’s actually on an otherworldly mission from the heavenly realm and has chosen Jin to serve as his guide. Part coming-of-age tale and part mythological fantasy, the single-season series is a formidable adaptation of Gene Yang’s graphic novel.

Star Wars: Visions

For a franchise as varied and diverse as Star Wars, sometimes its output can feel a little same-y. That’s not the case with Visions. The point of the anthology series is to provide “all-new, creative” takes on the Star Wars universe. The first series, which premiered in 2021, featured nine installments from some of the best anime studios in Japan, including Kamikaze Douga and Trigger. The second anthology, which arrived in 2023, broadens the scope further, incorporating work from studios in India, Ireland, Spain, Chile, France, South Africa, the US, and the UK. If you’re looking for the best one-off tales from the Star Wars universe, look no further.

The Mandalorian

The Mandalorian was, and is, exactly what the Star Wars franchise needed. Everything about this Jon Favreau series feels like classic TV—from the episodic adventures to the cameos. Set in the outer reaches of the galaxy, it follows a moody, masked Mandalorian bounty hunter (WIRED cover star Pedro Pascal) and really delivers on the hype with its retro-futuristic robots, salty Space Western vibes, lack of Skywalker baggage, and, of course, Grogu (aka Baby Yoda). The Mandalorian really set the tone for what a great Star Wars series could be, and while not every subsequent show has been as good, others, like Andor, have lived up to the precedent it set—and proved Star Wars stories can make for great TV. There's still no official word on a fourth season, but there is one more exciting adventure on the horizon: a movie, The Mandalorian & Grogu, which just got a May 22, 2026 release date.

Ms. Marvel

With Ms. Marvel, Disney manages to combine its knack for producing coming-of-age tween fare with its new role as caretaker of the MCU. Iman Vellani charms as Kamala Khan, an Avengers-obsessed high schooler from Jersey City who feels like an outsider in most areas of her life. But when a gold bangle arrives from her grandmother in Pakistan, Kamala begins to realize that all the time she's spent fantasizing about what life would be like with superpowers might have been preparing her for real life. With one foot in the teen drama world and the other in the comic book universe, Ms. Marvel—which just happens to feature Marvel’s first Muslim superhero—marks yet another admirable step forward for the company in both innovation and inclusion. In 2023, Vellani’s Ms. Marvel made the leap to the big screen to star alongside Brie Larson in The Marvels.

Obi-Wan Kenobi

Ewan McGregor has not always had the kindest words for the Star Wars prequels in which he first played the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi—a role he inherited from Alec Guinness, who also had plenty of less-than-favorable things to say about the franchise. So it was somewhat surprising when Lucasfilm announced that McGregor would be donning his Jedi gear again to star in a stand-alone Star Wars series for Disney+. (Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy has already said there will not be a second season.) In many ways, however, it allowed McGregor and former costar Hayden Christensen to course-correct some of their earlier work, as it follows a downtrodden Obi-Wan attempting to process his personal and professional disappointment over losing Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) to the Dark Side.

The Beatles: Get Back

In January 1969, just more than a year before they announced they were breaking up, the Beatles allowed a film crew unprecedented access to the creative process and recording of Let It Be, which would be their final studio album. Fifty years later, Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson was presented with the nearly 60 hours of film footage and more than 150 hours of audio that resulted from this project, and he remastered it and turned it into a three-part docuseries. Whether you’re already a Beatles fan or not, the documentary is a fascinating look at the creative process of one of the music world’s most influential bands as they work against the clock to finish recording an album, decide to have a free concert on their label’s rooftop, and occasionally butt heads. Knowing what the subjects do not know—that this will be the last time they perform live together or record an album—only adds to the project’s intimacy. The miniseries won all five Emmys it was nominated for in 2022, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series.

Moon Knight

Oscar Isaac brings yet another marquee name to Marvel’s growing roster of all-star talents with Moon Night. Here, Isaac plays a man with dissociative identity disorder, giving us not one but three distinct characters: mercenary Mark Spector, British gift shop employee Steven Grant, and the mysterious—and seemingly ominous—Jake Lockley. Ultimately, he must face off against himself to get the answers he’s seeking. For Moon Knight, Isaac told Empire that he was thrilled to be able to do something “really fucking nutty on a major stage”—and he delivers.

The Muppet Show

While The Muppet Show, which ran for five seasons between 1976 and 1981, is considered a piece of classic television today, it wasn’t always smooth sailing for creator Jim Henson. Henson produced two one-off Muppet specials that were intended to take the show into prime time, but neither came to fruition. Fortunately, the Muppets did have a recurring gig in “The Land of Gorch” sketches that aired during Saturday Night Live’s first season, as viewers of Jason Reitman's Saturday Night learned. When SNL became a hit, Henson knew that there was a potentially massive audience for an adult-oriented Muppet show (not to mention celebrity connections to entice plenty of A-list names to host). The rest is Muppet history.

The Punisher

The Punisher is yet another Netflix-turned-Disney+ Marvel series that also happens to be a spinoff of Daredevil. Like Daredevil, the Punisher (real name: Frank Castle, played by Jon Bernthal) is a vigilante who seems to relish exacting revenge, regardless of the results. He and Daredevil operate within the same universe, and while the Punisher sort of admires Daredevil’s quest for true justice, Daredevil despises the Punisher’s by-any-means-necessary methods. Bernthal brings an intensity to the role that, while undoubtedly violent, also has a sense of humor about it.

Boy Meets World

If ABC’s TGIF lineup wasn’t a part of your night as a kid, you clearly didn’t grow up in the ’90s. But Disney+ is happy to right that wrong by housing all seven seasons of the teen sitcom in its library. Corey Matthews (Ben Savage) deals with the ups and downs of growing up and ever-evolving relationships with friends and family—plus that one teacher, Mr. Feeny (William Daniels)—who always has the right answer to your problems, whether you like it or not. As the show progressed and the kids grew up, serious issues like drugs and sex were thrown into the mix, which didn’t always please the network. When the show aired on the original Disney Channel, a few episodes weren’t included in the lineup because of the more mature subject matter. You can also check out all three seasons of Girl Meets World, the series reboot (which features Corey as the parent and Mr. Feeny) when you’re done.

Jessica Jones

Just about six months after Daredevil arrived on the scene, Netflix took another chance on a Marvel property with Jessica Jones. In this dark dive into the world of superheroes, Krysten Ritter plays a private investigator who gave up her days as a superhero after a major catastrophe. But you can’t deny who you are, as Jessica discovers when it seems like every case that comes her way forces her to confront her past—and the supervillain Kilgrave (David Tennant), who turned her into a shell of her former self.

Hawkeye

Yet another in an ever growing string of spinoff TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Hawkeye gives some long overdue attention to Jeremy Renner’s Clint Barton, who in many ways has often seemed like the forgotten Avenger. The supernaturally skilled archer is in most of the ensemble Avengers films, but this Disney+ series marks his first solo outing. The show sees Hawkeye teaming up with Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), a precocious twentysomething who shares his skills for slinging arrows but lacks his eye for danger. It’s set during the holidays, and there are shades of Die Hard as the eponymous character tries to save the day and make it home in time for Christmas. Let the arguments about whether it’s a Christmas TV show begin.

Monsters at Work

Monsters at Work is the Monsters, Inc. spinoff you didn’t know you needed. It picks up the action six months after the end of the iconic Pixar movie—after Sully and his friend and colleague Mike (a giant green eyeball) have reworked the Monstropolis energy grid to run on laughter instead of children’s screams.

The Bad Batch

Yes, Disney really is milking its Star Wars properties for all they’re worth. The Bad Batch is an animated spinoff series set in the aftermath of the Clone Wars, between the prequel trilogy and the original trilogy in the overarching timeline. It follows a group of clone soldiers with genetic defects that give them individual traits and personalities, making them well suited to taking on daring mercenary missions. All three seasons are available to stream.

WandaVision

This slow-burning sitcom parody is unexpectedly compelling. For the first couple of episodes, even hardened Marvel fans will have very little idea what’s going on, as Avengers Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) live out an idyllic family life in black-and-white 1950s suburbia. Quickly, it becomes clear that something is wrong in the quiet town of Westview, as the world of the show ties into the wider MCU. Olsen reprises her role in Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, which picks up right after the events of WandaVision.

The Falcon and the Winter Soldier

After the surreal sitcom stylings of WandaVision, the second Marvel show to land on Disney+ covers more familiar ground. It's an action-packed thriller that follows Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) as they try to fill the void left by Captain America in the months after the events of Avengers: Endgame.

Star Wars Rebels

Accessible for kids and adults alike—and undoubtedly one of the best Star Wars TV series on Disney+—this animated series follows a group of rebels led by the former Jedi Kanan Jarrus (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and featuring his force-sensitive Padawan, Ezra Bridger (Ezra Gray). Fan favorite Ahsoka Tano (Ashley Eckstein) is another regular character across its four seasons, which do a neat job of fleshing out the time between the end of the prequel trilogy and the beginning of the original one.

The Simpsons

Have you got some time on your hands? Well, the 36 seasons of The Simpsons currently streaming on Disney+ should keep you busy. What can be said about one of the longest-running—and arguably most famous—animated TV shows ever made? While the first season is a little patchy by today’s standards, and there are ongoing arguments about when the show went from essential viewing to neglected cash cow, whatever your view, there are literally weeks worth of entertainment here.

X-Men: The Animated Series

If you really want to nerd out, this critically acclaimed animated X-Men series from the ’90s is worth a watch. In fact, the first two films in the live-action movie franchise drew heavily from this cartoon, which serves as a nice reminder of what can be done with rich source material.

Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

This seven-season series, which is for serious Marvel fans, revolves around S.H.I.E.L.D.’s less super agents, led by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg). The first season takes a while to warm up, but it really hits its stride in its second and especially third seasons, and it eventually ramps up with a complex plot that ties into the films.

Agent Carter

Agent Carter is a better show than Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but it struggled to find an audience during its two seasons. Hayley Atwell reprises her role as Peggy Carter from several MCU films in this 1940s-set series, where she doubles as an agent for the US government while helping Howard Stark (Tony’s dad) out of more than one jam. The two seasons stretch to only 18 episodes, so it’s a quick watch, but one worth making the time for.

Star Wars: The Clone Wars

This is another Star Wars animated show worth seeking out, though it’s not to be confused with the equally worthy 2003 animated series Star Wars: Clone Wars from legendary Samurai Jack creator Genndy Tartakovsky. Both series deal with the period between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith and chronicle the rise of Anakin Skywalker from arrogant Padawan to powerful Jedi Master.

Inside Pixar

There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes content on Disney+. These are short clips that, in another age, would have been confined to the DVD extras menu. But this series of 20-minute documentaries on different Pixar movies offers a fascinating insight into the animated hit machine.

What If …?

Here’s an animated series based on one simple question: What if? The Watcher, played by Jeffrey Wright, is an extraterrestrial being who observes the multiverse, occasionally making minor changes to influence events. This series looks at how events in the Marvel movies would have turned out differently if they’d had a Sliding Doors moment. The first episode follows an alternate timeline in which Steve Rogers remains a scrawny sidekick and Agent Carter becomes a Union Jack-draped super soldier. Actors from the films reprise their roles, including Josh Brolin as Thanos, Chris Hemsworth as Thor, and Karen Gillan as Nebula.",,"Jennifer M.

The gamepads on the market now are of higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from even one console generation ago. If you play games on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you have the unenviable task of choosing between several high-quality controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, Nacon, and Turtle Beach. Some of them have drift-resistant Hall effect or TMR-based joysticks for improved longevity, yet all of them are good for one reason or another. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool, but barely worked, are over.

We’ve spent a ton of time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard, Xbox Wireless Controller is the best option for most folks. It makes for a great PC and Steam Deck controller, too. The default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, but there are several alternatives worth considering.

Featured in this article

What we’re looking for How we test Xbox controllers Collapse We test Xbox controllers by playing with them for an extended period of time across a variety of genres. Our test targets include team-based arena games like Marvel Rivals, competitive shooters like Call of Duty, fighters like Tekken 8, and role-playing titles like Elden Ring. When doing so, we pay close attention to how all of the components feel. Are the triggers satisfying to pull? Do the analog sticks offer the right level of resistance? Are the D-pads and face buttons too mushy, or just right? If a controller includes customization options — such as adjustable trigger stops and sensitivity, and / or remappable back buttons — we test how easy they are to configure, then judge their impact on our gameplay experience. Connectivity Collapse Is it wireless? Does it support Bluetooth? Or is it wired only? If so, is the cable replaceable? Quality Collapse Does it feel cheap or nicely made? Any glitches or reliability issues while testing? Extra features Collapse Does it have handy extras, like remappable buttons or fancy triggers? Customization Collapse Can you remap buttons or tune it with custom software profiles? Value Collapse Is it priced affordably, about average, or does it come at a steep premium?

The best Xbox controller for most people

Connectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable

Okay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of all that has made the last 20 years of Xbox gamepads great, and it shows.

Thanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, this is the only affordable wireless Xbox controller out there. (Third-party wireless options have been trickling out in recent years, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox wireless controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C wired connection.

You won’t find a better wireless controller at this price. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge

But the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its varied connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $65 (and often less) asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you’ll probably be best served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like Hori’s Horipad Pro — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is otherwise an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.

The only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity (button remapping is available), though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which bumps the price from $79.99 to $116.95 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors that Microsoft offers.

The best cheap Xbox controller

Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: Yes / Power: Wired

The 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $44.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99. The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.

On the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks with satisfying tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the PowerA Advantage Wired. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we’d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers. You can download the 8BitDo Ultimate Software X app on PC or Xbox to fully customize this controller.

8BitDo controllers may be inexpensive, but that doesn’t mean they should be considered cheap. Photo: Quentyn Kennemer / The Verge

The 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a three-mode wireless version for $69.99 with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles.

The best “pro” Xbox controller

Connectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable

The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fanciest controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and as a result, it just feels nicer in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $199.99 (or sometimes less, if it’s on sale).

There’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $149.99, which ditches the add-ons but is equally customizable. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.

A pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of a splurge purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels that require its high-end features. Nevertheless, it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your liking, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc., while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool or easy as when using an Elite.

While the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).

The Elite Series 2 offers unprecedented customization with analog sticks and a D-pad you can pluck right off. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge

Even so, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.

A formidable alternative to the Elite

Connectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable

At $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is as expensive (or more, depending on available deals) than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, yielding a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours).

Other than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.

It’s not every day you see six buttons on top of a controller. Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge

The Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its more basic software customization, its lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its high price, which, unlike the Series 2, is rarely subjected to discounts. Luckily, if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired configuration.

Other Xbox controllers we tested

What’s coming next?

We’re testing GameSir’s G7 Pro, a $79.99 controller that’s compatible with Xbox (wired), PC (wired and wireless via an included 2.4GHz dongle), and Android (wireless via Bluetooth). The G7 Pro has drift-resistant TMR joysticks, Hall effect analog triggers, four customizable buttons, four rumble motors, and a 3.5mm audio jack.

Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.

It used to be easy to pick an Apple Watch. All you had to do was choose whether you wanted the larger model or the smaller one. Then Apple added optional cellular connectivity. Then, a more affordable Watch SE (now in its second generation) and, in 2022, the rugged Apple Watch Ultra (also now in its second generation). Suddenly, there are lots of options.

Now that the Series 10 has been out for nearly a year, perfectly good older versions of the Apple Watch are regularly getting discounted as retailers try to empty their inventory. You may also see more refurbished versions of these older models pop up. If you’re interested in more premium materials, like stainless steel, this is a great way to get a fancier version of last year’s watch. You won’t be missing out on too much, either. The past few years have seen iterative updates in terms of hardware — and the bulk of new features come from software updates. With that said, keep in mind that the latest version of watchOS, watchOS 11, doesn’t support the Series 4, 5, and first-gen SE. The same can be said of watchOS 26, which is slated to arrive in the fall.

What we’re looking for How we test Apple Watches Collapse Apple Watches do a lot of things, from tracking your health and fitness to fielding notifications. As with other wearables, we do a mix of year-round experiential testing and benchmarks. So while we may not take a tumble down a flight of stairs, we’ll note if organically tripping during a walk triggers Fall Detection. (Or doesn’t.) We also check to see how accurate sleep tracking, heart rate, and GPS are versus long-term control devices, like the Oura Ring or a Garmin. We’ll also note how the various Apple Watch models compare to each other on factors like durability, performance, and battery life. Who is it for? Collapse We’re not going to recommend an Apple Watch Ultra for a couch potato — unless you want the best battery life possible. The idea is to guide you to the right Apple Watch for your needs. Price Collapse Should you buy new? You can often save on an Apple Watch by buying refurbished, especially since there generally aren’t a ton of changes year to year. Feature set Collapse Do you want to shell out extra for LTE? Which models have what sensors, and how does that apply to you? LTE or GPS Collapse Some scenarios call for you to buy cellular models, others you can get away with just having GPS.

Buying refurbished is one way that you may be able to upgrade from an older model without sacrificing blood oxygen. Due to a patent battle with Masimo, new Series 9 and Ultra 2 models sold in the US after January 18th, 2024, no longer have this feature. This is not a big deal for most people, but if it’s important to you, older watches and Series 9 and Ultra 2 units sold by Apple before January 18th, 2024, still retain the feature. (As do watches overseas. The ban only impacts US units.)

What about the newer Series 10? In a nutshell, it’s got a bigger screen, it’s about 10 percent thinner, and it’s lighter than previous models. It’s also got an FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature. There are a ton of new colors and finishes, with titanium replacing stainless steel. All in all, it’s an iterative update but one we find meaningful in terms of readability and wearability.

So much choice can lead to analysis paralysis. But don’t worry. I’ve tested every single version of the Apple Watch you can buy right now — in addition to basically every other fitness watch and smartwatch on the market — and can steer you in the right direction. Just keep in mind that Apple typically announces new Apple Watch models in September, meaning it might be wise to hold off just a bit longer before making your decision.

Should you get an Apple Watch?

The Apple Watch is the best overall smartwatch for iPhone users. Many smartwatches are better than the Apple Watch for hardcore athletes, even with the Ultra models in the mix. But other watches fall short when it comes to productivity, safety features, controlling your smart home, and interacting with other Apple devices and services. And the Apple Watch has the most robust third-party app ecosystem of any smartwatch on the market.

By their nature, wearables are incredibly personal devices — and you won’t get the benefits of an Apple Watch if you don’t wear it regularly. The last thing you want is to spend hundreds of dollars on a thing that ends up collecting dust in a drawer. The best way to avoid this is to stack the deck in your favor and prioritize comfort. Before you try to start mulling over which Apple Watch model you should get, take a second to figure out which size and strap material will best fit your wrist.

The SE and Series watches come in two sizes each. The SE comes in 40mm and 44mm, while the Series 7, 8, and 9 are 41mm and 45mm. The new Series 10 ups the size again to 42mm and 46mm. The larger models are better for readability, while the smaller ones are more comfortable for those with petite wrists. Both the SE and the Series watches have aluminum cases, but the Series 10 now comes in titanium, too. (Older models come in stainless steel.) Most people will be fine with aluminum, but if you’re clumsy or very active, you’ll benefit from the extra durability offered by stainless steel or titanium. You might also just like the look better — and that’s valid since watches are a personal piece of tech. Just be prepared to pay a few hundred bucks more for that.

As for straps, we recommend the nylon sport loop, as it’s the most breathable option, has the easiest clasp, and is less irritating than the silicone options, which is great for sensitive skin. If you’re looking for more fashionable options, we recommend checking out Amazon or Etsy for a wider variety of styles and more affordable pricing. You’ll want to check third parties for leather accessories, too, as Apple announced in 2023 that it would no longer make leather accessories in a bid to achieve carbon neutrality.

The Ultra and Ultra 2 both come in one size — 49mm — and with titanium cases. They come with their own special straps, too: the Trail Loop, Alpine Loop, and Ocean Band. As their names suggest, they’re geared toward runners, hikers, and divers, but you can pick whichever one suits your fancy. We recommend the Trail Loop, as it’s the lightest and most versatile of the three. All the Ultra straps work with any 44mm or 45mm Series watch, and the Ultra is compatible with any 44mm or 45mm Apple Watch strap.

And while the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch you can get as an iPhone user, you can also always check out our fitness tracker buying guide.

Apple Watch Series, SE, or Ultra?

The latest Apple Watch, the Series 10, is a more modest update. It primarily focuses on making the watches more comfortable while adding a larger, wide-angle OLED display. If you’re upgrading from an older model, you’ll definitely notice that you can see more from the wrist. The speakers now play music and podcasts, and voice isolation on calls has been improved. There’s an added depth and water temperature sensor, which makes it a better companion for water sports as well. Fast charging has also been meaningfully improved. On the health front, Apple has brought FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection to the watch, along with the Series 9 and Ultra 2.

We recommend the second-gen Apple Watch SE for younger people and first-time smartwatch buyers. If you’re upgrading from an earlier Apple Watch, you want an always-on display, or you want more advanced health tracking, you should consider the Series 10. And if you want the brightest screen, the best durability and battery life, and even more advanced fitness features, we recommend the Ultra 2.

The Series 10 is Apple’s flagship smartwatch. Compared to earlier models, it’s going to get you the fastest processor, quick charging, a larger display, and all the latest sensors. Prices start at $399 for the 42mm version and $429 for the 46mm, but you can often find both models on sale. Adding LTE connectivity will add $100 to the price, plus whatever your carrier charges for the service. Prices start at $699 for the polished titanium models.

The second-gen SE has a nylon composite back, which helps shave $30 off the original’s price. You can get a cellular version, and it supports many of the same advanced features as the last-last-gen Series 8, like fall detection, emergency calling, Fitness Plus, Apple Pay, and Apple Watch For Your Kids. The biggest difference is that it lacks an always-on display, an EKG sensor, temperature sensors, and a SpO2 sensor. The display is also slightly smaller on both sizes of the SE. It starts at $249 for the 40mm and $279 for the 44mm, but you can regularly find them for cheaper. Adding LTE will tack on an extra $50 in addition to your carrier’s fees.

To be perfectly honest, if you’re young and healthy, you’re not really missing out on EKG or SpO2. (Also, newer watches sold in the US currently have the SpO2 feature disabled anyway.) The SE’s heart rate sensor is still capable of providing abnormal heart rate alerts. Right now, Apple’s SpO2 features are limited to spot checks. There’s not much you can do with that information, and unlike the EKGs, this is only cleared for general wellness purposes. It will not be able to replace a fingertip pulse oximeter, and you should never use it in this way.

The main purpose of the EKG sensor is to enable atrial fibrillation detection — and if your doctor’s given you a clean bill of health, you will likely only use this feature once or twice. According to the American Heart Association, the biggest risk factors for AFib are advanced age, underlying heart conditions, high blood pressure, family history, and sleep apnea, among other lifestyle choices. If this doesn’t apply to you, the SE is still going to give you an excellent health tracking experience and all the same smart features. Young, first-time buyers may as well save the extra cash — so long as the lack of an always-on display isn’t a deal-breaker.

You can’t really see much of a difference between the Ultra on the left and the Ultra 2 on the right.

There are some situations where opting for the Series 10 is the better choice, however, like if you want an always-on display or need to have the latest and greatest. The larger, wide-angle OLED display also provides much better readability for anyone with bad eyesight. It’s also the better choice if you have a heart condition or are at a higher risk of developing AFib. If you suspect you may have sleep apnea, you’ll also need a Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 to access that feature.

The Ultra 2 currently sits atop the lineup as Apple’s premium smartwatch. It’s visually distinct from both the Series and SE — and at 49mm, it’s the biggest of them all. Not only that, it has increased durability, water resistance, and a raised lip to protect the flat display. It also has an additional water temperature and depth sensor for divers, three microphones, and two speakers, which enable the Siren. It’s also got the Action button, which can be programmed for various activities, pause workouts, and trigger the Siren.

At $799, the Ultra 2 is the most expensive Apple Watch, but every model comes equipped with LTE capability. If you have an Ultra and are wondering if you should upgrade to the second-gen model, the answer is no. If you have an Ultra 2 and are wondering if you should upgrade to the new black color, the answer is also no. (Admittedly, it does look quite nice.) It’s too soon, and there’s not enough of a difference. We recommend the Ultra 2 for new buyers only.

What about blood oxygen? As of January 18th, 2024, Apple no longer sells new Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 models with the blood oxygen feature in the US. That’s because Apple is currently undergoing a patent dispute with medical device maker Masimo. The International Trade Commission has ruled that Apple Watches with the blood oxygen feature infringe on two of Masimo’s patents — and are therefore subject to an import ban. This doesn’t affect watches sold outside of the US, or the Apple Watch SE, which doesn’t have the blood oxygen sensor in question. Watches sold by third-party retailers like Best Buy or Amazon may be unaffected if they’re selling refurbished models or happen to have pre-ban Series 9 or Ultra 2 inventory. You can tell if a model doesn’t have the blood oxygen feature if the part numbers end in LW/A. It also does not affect the newer sleep apnea detection feature, which utilizes the accelerometer. That said, the blood oxygen feature is not that vital a feature on any wearable just yet. Many either have spot check features only or passively track your SpO2 overnight and give you an average in the morning. They cannot and should not replace fingertip pulse oximeters. But if the feature is important to you, you may want to look into alternatives from Garmin, the Fitbit Charge 6, the Withings ScanWatch 2, or the Oura Ring.

If battery life is your highest priority, getting either Ultra is the best choice. In testing, we got up to 60 hours without Low Power Mode enabled. However, if you use about one hour of GPS tracking a day or take calls, you’re more likely to get around two days. It’s also the better choice if you frequently hike, dive, or run trails. While marketed as a hardcore watch for explorers, in our opinion, it’s more of an aspirational watch for weekend warriors and intermediate athletes — or anyone who wants to be at that level.

You’re not going to beat either Ultra on battery life, but you can stretch out the battery life on the Series 4 or later with Low Power Mode. You can even sleep track with Low Power Mode on, though it’ll turn off background health sensors. With the Series 10, Apple has improved fast charging as well. Official estimates are that you can get 0 to 80 percent in 30 minutes, which roughly matches our real-world testing. Just be sure you’re using the correct charging accessories.

If you have smaller wrists, you may want to opt for the Series 10 as it has fast charging and is more comfortable to wear long-term. Faster charging comes in clutch when you’re about to head to bed and you’ve only got 15 percent battery. Also, if you’re the type that values futureproofing, the Series 10’s hardware will be able to support newer features for a longer period of time thanks to its newer processor. This is why folks who love their watch and are looking to upgrade from a Series 4 or older should also pick the Series 10. If you’re already in the habit of wearing the watch daily, you’ll get more mileage out of it as the SE is more of a gateway device, and the Ultra is overkill for the average Joe.

The best Apple Watch if you’re on a budget

The latest Watch SE is the way to go for people who want to futureproof their hardware without breaking the bank (so long as you’re okay forgoing a larger display). You’re getting the same processor as the Series 8 and original Ultra, plus Crash Detection.

While the second-gen SE is an excellent watch, it’s not always the right choice. It’s meant to be a gateway watch, so it’s best suited to folks who are completely new to the Apple Watch and want to spend as little as possible. If you’re looking to upgrade from an older watch but don’t want to pony up for the Series 10, there’s another option: buying a used or refurbished Apple Watch.

Buying secondhand devices is also better for the environment and a more affordable way to get more expensive materials. Materials like sapphire glass, stainless steel, or titanium can add hundreds to the price of a new watch. It’s also a good way to save money if you’re just not excited by the Series 10’s features but want more than what the SE offers.

It’ll take some patience to find the best price and the model you want. After all, you’re limited by what’s available. However, there are several sites that offer older models. Sometimes, you can also find deals and sales as well. If you’re worried about getting scammed, look for deals recommended by sources you trust (cough, cough, Verge Deals). Apple also sells its own refurbished models, which come with a full Apple warranty and are generally in a “like new” condition, though the selection can be limited, and you likely won’t pay less than a new SE. Sites like Back Market will also allow you to sort by condition and obtain a 12-month warranty.

If you’re considering a used or refurbished model, we recommend the Series 7 or Series 8, as they offer a larger screen for improved readability. We also recommend that you use $250 as a benchmark since that’s the price of a base model Watch SE. With that said, if you’re getting premium materials, going a little higher is fine. Do not get a refurbished Series 5 or older. Although you can find them for $100 (sometimes less!), they can’t run the latest software and even struggle to update the newest software they do support.

The best Apple Watch for kids

If you want your child to have an Apple Watch, we recommend picking a cellular Apple Watch SE or, if you can find one, a refurbished Series 4, 5, or 6 with cellular. All of these watches come in smaller sizes than the Series 7, 8, or 9, which will likely better fit their wrist. Also, the lower price will give you better peace of mind if you have a rambunctious kid. They likely won’t need many of the marquee features found in watchOS 11, either. That being said, if you want the most futureproof options, the second-gen SE and Series 6 are the best choices.

Since you’re buying for children, you’ll likely want to use Apple Watch For Your Kids — formerly known as Family Setup — as it will give you greater parental controls. However, there are technical specifications that you’ll need to match in order to use it. You’ll need a cellular version of the device, and it must at least support watchOS 7. Apple’s support page also states that you need a Series 4 or later or an Apple Watch SE to use it.

The second-gen SE is a good option to give to your kids. Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge

If you opt for the family route, not every feature will be available. While you can get Apple Pay and certain health features, you will not get the following: health data sharing, respiratory rate, irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, Blood Oxygen, Podcasts, Remote, News, Home, and Shortcuts.

The best Apple Watch for older relatives

This can be a tricky one, but we recommend a cellular Series 9 or 10.

For starters, the larger screen is much easier on the eyes. You can also increase the text size to be larger than on the SE or older Apple Watches. The always-on display aids accessibility, especially if arm mobility is a consideration. You’ll also get the full suite of health features, including irregular heartbeat alerts, walking steadiness, EKGs, fall detection, sleep apnea detection, and emergency calling. These models also have the double tap feature and improved Siri functionality, which may be helpful for elderly relatives with dexterity issues.

You can use the Ultra, but you should keep its size and weight in mind. Depending on your loved one’s wrist size and health, it may not make sense. Both sizes of the Series 10 have comparable screen sizes but are much lighter and more comfortable to wear.

If your older relative has an iPhone and you’re hoping to use this for health reasons, we also don’t recommend using Apple’s family setup. That’s because you cannot use features like irregular heart rhythm notifications, EKG, and health data sharing. If your relative doesn’t have an iPhone, however, it’s a fine option. You’ll still get high and low heart rate notifications, walking steadiness, and fall detection.

What’s coming next

In previous years, Apple has held an event in early September to show off its forthcoming product lineup. While the latest iPhones usually hog the spotlight, the fall event remains a prime time for the company to trot out the newest Apple Watch models, many of which launch shortly thereafter alongside Apple’s latest OS updates.

So, what can we expect this year? The Apple Watch Series 11 seems like a sure bet, and there have been murmurs regarding an Apple Watch Ultra 3 and a third-gen Apple Watch SE. Recently uncovered evidence in the fifth iOS 26 developer beta lends some credence to this report, suggesting the Ultra 3 could have a display resolution of 422 x 514, which is slightly bigger than the 410 x 502 resolution on the Ultra 2. The rumor mill has been pretty quiet outside of that, but if previous events are anything to go by, we can expect Apple’s refreshed lineup to offer updated design elements, better battery life, and new health features.

As the aircraft circles the dusty landscape dotted with shrubbery, it throws up clouds of sand and grit, through which he can just make out a bull elephant, running.

The colossal creature bounds around, a bundle of muscle and terror. It’s been hit twice on the flank with tranquilizer darts but is fighting the numbness and won’t fall down. Instead it panics, heading towards a nearby watering hole. The helicopter hovers in its path to stop it: if the elephant collapses in the water, it will die. The standoff soon ends as the animal falls to its knees, crushing a bush on its way down, and the helicopter descends alongside several trucks. What follows is a peculiar scene.

A group of people flip the elephant, which landed on its stomach, onto its side, so that it can breathe. Matson, a 53-year-old man from Shropshire, approaches, dressed in khaki trousers and sunglasses, like a safari ranger. He kneels next to the elephant and hooks its penis into a device that looks like a huge condom. A conservationist inserts a probe that emits small electrical shocks to stimulate the elephant’s prostate in a process known as electroejaculation. They start to pump. When they finish collecting the semen, they pack up their equipment and hover overhead in the helicopter until the elephant wakes up and canters off.

I watch this strange series of events, which happened in October 2019, in a video sent by Matson over WhatsApp. The experience, he says, was one of the best of his life.

After collection, the elephant’s semen was brought back to Matson’s farm to be stored and later used in breeding programs. Elephants in captivity have a high rate of stillbirths and infant mortality, according to the RSPCA. As the endangered animals face extinction in the coming decades, conservationists are working with elephant sanctuaries to gather semen samples in the wild, transport it to other locations, and hopefully improve the survival rate of calves born through artificial insemination.

But Matson is no park ranger or elephant conservationist. He runs an artificial insemination company for race horses from his family’s farm in Shropshire, England, which collects and stores semen from prizewinning studs for breeding purposes. He may not be an obvious choice to save the animal kingdom, but that is what he’s setting out to do.

By transferring his skills from horses to endangered species, Matson is planning to build the biggest biobank of animal cells in Europe. Nature’s SAFE, a charity which he founded in December 2020, aims to collect 50 million genetic samples and “freeze them in time,” storing cells from critically endangered species including the Amur leopard, black rhino and mountain chicken frog in cryogenic tanks. Working with partners including Chester Zoo, the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, and researchers at the University of Oxford, his idea is to harvest and preserve samples of semen—as well as ova and other tissue—that could one day be used to regenerate dwindling animal populations and prevent them from going extinct.",,"Natasha Bernal, Alex Christian, Lexi Pandell, Katie Drummond, Emily Mullin, Andrea J.

It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the 2020 laptop starting at $599 ($50 off) at Walmart — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro.

Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.bot

Although Macs may not get perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $800. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.

But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.

The best MacBook Air deals

M1 MacBook Air

The M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while the redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air (which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in our guide to the best laptops.

The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $599 ($50 off), which is its lowest price to date.

2020 MacBook Air with M1 (256GB) $ 599 $ 649 8 % off $ 599 The 2020 MacBook Air has been discontinued but remains a great value. It comes outfitted with the company’s original M1 chip in one of three different colors (silver, space gray, and gold). Read More $599 at Walmart

M2 MacBook Air

The M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads.

It does have some slight downsides, though, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the best laptops.

The M2-powered MacBook Air from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at Best Buy starting at $699 ($100 off). B&H Photo is offering a souped up 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air with a 10-core GPU, 24GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD for $1,699 ($800 off).

It’s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15.3-inch MacBook Air M2, however. While it’s in short supply at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M4 model.

M3 MacBook Air

The M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the M3 MacBook Air to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in 2024 in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port. Apple discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM last year and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.

The entry-level 13-inch M3 MacBook Air configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is tough to find in stock. However, you can get the 24GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) in select colors at Best Buy. Given the relatively small price difference between these two models, it’s great that you’re getting double the amount of internal storage and additional memory.

As for the M3-powered 15-inch MacBook Air, you can buy it with 512GB of storage, 16GB of RAM, and a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) at Best Buy.

M4 MacBook Air

In March, along with an updated Mac Studio, Apple released an updated MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with a M4 processor. Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. There’s a lot to like.

Both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving some good discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $799 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage is on sale for $999 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.

The best MacBook Pro deals

During its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October 2024, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.

M3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro

The entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).

The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.

We’re finding it challenging to spot the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock. However, Best Buy is selling the 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, 10-core GPU for $1,299 ($300 off). You can also grab a 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 18GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 14-core GPU for $1,499 ($400 off) at Best Buy. If you need more space, you can also get a 14-inch, M3-powered MacBook Pro with 18GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and 18-core GPU for $1,799 ($500 off) at Best Buy.

M4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro

Apple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is open. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.

The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.

Deals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,299 ($300 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,699 ($300 off) at Best Buy and B&H Photo.

The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,223 ($277 off) at Amazon and $2,249 ($250 off) at Best Buy.

The best Mac Mini deals

The newest Mac Mini in town are the M4-based models which arrived late last year. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint of its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.

M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini

Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.

In addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three Thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit Ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit Ethernet for another $100.

Right now, you can get the base Mac Mini at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for around $546 ($54 off). If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for around $719 ($80 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.

Meanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale at Amazon starting at $1,255 ($144 off).

157,theverge.com,https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap,The best budget smartphone you can buy,2020-11-03T18:30:00+00:00,"is a reviewer with over a decade of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview.

Some of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets. They’re tools that help you get things done, not something you want to invest a lot of time or money in. If that’s you — and there’s no judgment here from a certifiable gadget nerd — then you can probably think of more worthwhile ways to spend $1,000 than on a phone.

Budget phones to the rescue. These devices are roughly $500 or under, though not all of them, and they’re more capable than ever. You won’t get all the bells and whistles, but you will save a little money to spend on, I don’t know, actual bells and whistles. It’s your world.

What I’m looking for How we test Collapse There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless. Strong software support Collapse At least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There’s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches. A good screen Collapse Since you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone’s screen is one place you shouldn’t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today’s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens; however, for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn’t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate. Serviceable storage space Collapse If you plan to hang onto your phone for a while, you’ll want enough storage space to accommodate all the system files, photos, and videos you’ll accumulate over the years. Ideally, you’ll get at least 128GB built in. One good rear camera, not four mediocre ones Collapse Upgrades like telephoto cameras and optical image stabilization are rare in the under-$500 class, but you can still expect good, basic performance in good lighting from any modern smartphone. Low light is trickier. Phones in this class should offer a night mode to help with non-moving subjects in very dim light. And there are no bonus points awarded for adding extra macro and depth cameras to pad out the rear camera array — those 2- and 5-megapixel sensors are pretty much useless.

What compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.

The best cheap iPhone

Screen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

If I were making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.

There’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.

Another heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.

The best Android phone under $500

Screen: 6.3-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G4 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,100mAh / Charging: 23W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68

Google’s Pixel A-series phones have been my go-to recommendation for a cheap Android phone for years, but there was still room for improvement. With the 9A, Google made some modest tweaks that make it even easier to recommend — and at $499, the price is right.

The phone uses a Tensor G4 chipset that doesn’t run as hot as some of its predecessors, and performance is reliable. The 6.3-inch OLED screen is a little bigger and a bit brighter than last year’s, which makes a noticeable difference when you use the phone outside. Durability also received a slight boost to IP68, which means it can withstand a drop in deeper water than the IP67-rated Pixel 8A.

The 9A’s camera is fine, though it comes up short against the rest of the Pixel 9 series in low light. Portrait mode could be better, too, and if you care a lot about image quality, then that might be a good reason to consider stepping up to a Pixel 9. But it does the trick for everyday snaps, and for the price, the 9A’s better qualities outweigh its shortcomings by a wide margin.

The budget phone with a big, beautiful screen

Screen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 50-megapixel 2x telephoto, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP65

The OnePlus 13R isn’t quite as well-rounded as my pick for the best overall budget Android phone, the Pixel 9A. It’s also a little pricier at $599 — although we’ve seen it on sale for $499 for extended periods of time — but for some people, the 13R’s upgrades will make it a better choice. It comes with one of the best big screens in its class, and many people love a big screen. The 13R also offers very strong battery performance; unless you’re a power user, you can probably manage two full days on a single charge.

There’s also very fast charging with the included charger, though you won’t find wireless charging at any speed. The 13R also lacks full water resistance; it should hold up fine against sprays and rain showers, but it isn’t rated to withstand full immersion. Plenty of people won’t find those omissions bothersome, but they make it harder to recommend to a general audience, especially at a higher price than the Pixel 9A.

But what's the best Apple Watch to buy? Just a little while ago, this question was more complicated. In 2024, a court ruling dictated that Apple could no longer sell the latest watches—the Series 9, the Watch Ultra 2, and the Series 10—with a blood oxygen sensor. The medical technology company Masimo alleged that Apple had infringed on its patent. However, in August 2025, Apple redesigned the sensor via a software update, and you now have this feature again. Blood oxygen sensing is back, baby!

The current model is the Apple Watch Series 10, but are last year’s Series 9 and Ultra Watch 2 still worth it? Yes, if you're looking for specific features and not others. I love the Apple Watch. 10 years on, it's still the beautiful, Jony Ive–designed wearable that everyone who has an iPhone has to have. It is the watch I'd wear if I weren't constantly testing other fitness trackers. (Now my children test them as well.) But how can you tell them apart when all of these watches look pretty similar and share a rotating stable of features? We break down which one is best for you and whether older models are worth the price.

Wondering what the operating system for these watches will look like? Check out our breakdown of WatchOS 26 and our other relevant buying guides, including the Best Smartwatches, Best Fitness Trackers, and Best iPhones.

Both the newer AirPods Max and AirPods 4 (with and without ANC) now consistently receive discounts, as do the latest AirPods Pro with USB-C. Events like Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday often bring the steepest discounts, though you can still find great deals throughout the year.

Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals currently available on each model, including both iterations of the AirPods 4, the latest AirPods Pro, and the AirPods Max.

The best AirPods 4 deals

At its September 2024 event, Apple introduced the AirPods 4, a pair of wireless earbuds available in two variations: a $129 standard model and a $179 noise-canceling model. Both versions represent significant upgrades over the third-gen AirPods, with a more comfortable design and improved audio performance. They’re also better for taking calls thanks to Apple’s Voice Isolation feature, which focuses the mics on your voice so you can be heard more clearly in noisy environments.

The $179 AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation offer a surprisingly effective noise-canceling mode, a helpful transparency mode, and several other Pro-level features. The latest AirPods Pro do a better job of tuning out noise, but the AirPods 4 with ANC still do a good job of reducing sound. They also feature other perks formerly reserved for Apple’s top-of-the-line earbuds, including wireless charging and a case with a built-in speaker that allows you to easily track it down via Apple’s Find My app.

Given they’ve been out for nearly a year, we consistently see discounts on both versions of the AirPods 4. Right now, for instance, the standard AirPods 4 are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $99 ($30 off), which is just $10 shy of their all-time low. The AirPods 4 with ANC, meanwhile, are matching their second-best price to date at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can currently pick them up starting at $148.99 (also $30 off).

The best AirPods Pro (second-gen) deals

In 2022, Apple released the second-gen AirPods Pro, which feature a similar build to the first-gen model but offer better noise cancellation, swipe-based controls, and an extra-small pair of swappable silicone ear tips for smaller ears. Apple followed up a year later with a minor refresh, one that features a USB-C charging case and an upgraded IP54 rating for water and dust resistance. The newest model also supports lossless audio when used with Apple’s new Vision Pro headset and doubles as a pair of FDA-approved hearing aids.

As far as deals go, Apple’s updated AirPods Pro with USB-C are currently available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $169 ($80 off), which remains the best price we’ve seen this year outside of Prime Day.

The best AirPods Max deals

The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and expansive, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response and features. They’re not the best noise-canceling headphones for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a better pair of Bluetooth headphones if you’re an iPhone user.

Toward the end of last year, Apple replaced the first-gen Max with a new model that features support for USB-C charging and a few new color options. As of writing, they’re on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in all six colors for $479.99 ($70 off) — not quite the $399 low we saw during Prime Day.

Bike Friday All-Day Photograph: Adrienne So

Bike Friday All-Day for $5,200: Bike Friday bills the irresistibly tiny All-Day (7/10, WIRED Review) as the world's lightest Bosch-powered ebike, and it's true. You can customize all the colors and components of this folding electric bike, and it has a surprisingly powerful motor for its size. The Brompton above is more widely available and easier to use, but I love this little bike a lot.

Radio Flyer Via Pro for $2,899: Editor Julian Chokkattu could not have had a better experience than this easy-to-use and easy-to-assemble class 2 electric cargo bike. For more info, check out our guide to the Best Electric Cargo Bikes.

Aventon Level 3 for $1,899: The Aventon Level 3 is an easy-to-ride ebike that features a clean, step-through design and every feature you could want in a standard-size ebike for riding around town. There are built-in fenders and lights, and a big color display shows you how much of the up to 70 miles of advertised range you have remaining. I have ridden it up to about 25 miles at a time with my heavy 6'2"" frame, easily ending my rides with 20 percent of battery left. The frame feels comfortable and sturdy, thanks to a double-walled construction and improved Shimano gears and brakes. The front suspension fork and semi-hidden suspension seat post add to comfort relative to other bikes I’ve tested in this price range, and I like that the Aventon app lets you set up things like remote locking and geofencing, so you can keep an eye on your expensive bike from afar. The built-in turn signals, which use the bike’s rear lights, are another bonus when riding in cities at night. —Parker Hall

Tenways CGO800S for $1,999: This is a budget step-through city ebike. It boasts up to 50 miles of battery life, and I got more than 30. The torque sensor is smooth and responsive to pedaling at various speeds. However, there's no throttle, and because this bike is meant to fit riders of a huge range of sizes (they say 5'1'' to 6'3''), the frame was not as comfortable to pedal for me (5'11"") as some large-size bikes. —Martin Cizmar

Engwe LE20 for $1,899: The selling point of this bike is that for $1,500, you get a cargo bike with room for a massive payload and two high-capacity batteries, which is theoretically able to traverse 211 miles while carrying a 165-pound rider. The batteries only carried me about 80 miles on a single charge (I weigh a lot more and didn't pedal as much as I could have) during three days of testing on America's longest rail-to-trail project, but still, that's a wow stat. This is the roughest assembly job I've had with a DTC ebike, and I ultimately did take it into a shop where the owner congratulated me on the wise decision to not ride it as-is. With weight pushing 100 pounds, it's not easy to load up for travel—you're not putting this thing on a rack. It carries cargo with ease, and with the $170 fast-charger upgrade, you can cover serious mileage in a day. —Martin Cizmar

Aventon Ramblas for $2,599: Aventon made a mountain bike! It's a lot of bike for an affordable price, but just a little too heavy to take out for its intended use case. It makes a nice, rugged commuter, however.

Linus eDutchi for $1,799: Need a comfy cruiser? The Linus eDutchi is a comfy class 1 ebike with beautiful colors and loads of proprietary accessories.

Electra Loft Go! Photograph: Electra

Electra Loft Go! for $1,200: I also love the Electra Loft Go! (7/10, WIRED Recommends), which is another comfy sit-up beach cruiser, but the Priority has a slightly more powerful motor for the same price.

Xtracycle Estoker for $4,499: This is probably the bike that I see most often in my Portland, Oregon, neighborhood. It has a durable, sturdy Chromoly steel frame and larger 24-inch wheels, along with a Shimano mid-drive motor that makes it perfect for more grueling conditions. Unfortunately, you do have to be over 5'6"" (which I am not) to ride it.

Gazelle Eclipse for $6,399: If you want to know just how great the Bosch system can be, the Eclipse (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the more expensive version of the Radster Road above. It has a nicer shifter, a smarter motor—even the paint job is nicer. It's just much more expensive.

Heybike Tyson for $1,399: You get a lot of stuff for not very much money with the Tyson (6/10, WIRED Review), a fat-tire, folding ebike that includes suspension, blinkers, a throttle, and one of the most obnoxious horns I've ever heard. The components are not super-high-quality, but it's an affordable, comfortable way to dip your toes into ebike waters.

The Gocycle G4I+ for $5,999: Gocycle's high-end, fast-folding luxury bikes are designed by a former McLaren engineer. This quieter, lighter iteration has better torque, a new carbon-fiber front fork, and an even more painful price.

The Bunch Original Electric Cargo Bike for $6,499: I didn't care for the Bunch (5/10, WIRED Review), but my family did. It's a standard, if slightly expensive, box bike as you might see in Europe. It'll work well if you live in a flat area and don't have to go very fast.

Bikes We Dislike

Pass on the left.

The Retrospec Jax Rev Photograph: Retrospec

The Retrospec Jax Rev for $1,000: We wanted to love this sleek, stylish folding bike, but we couldn't help worrying about its durability.

Niu Electric Bike BQi-C3 Pro for $1.699: Commerce director Martin Cizmar tested this bike and had a litany of complaints. The riding position is too aggressive, and the bike frame doesn't fit common components like a water bottle and his pannier. The disc brakes weren't suited to stopping it from 28 mph.

FAQs How Does WIRED Procure Ebikes? Bike companies reach out to me, and I request testers in my size. Once I have finished testing, I either return the bikes to the manufacturer, the shop that assembled them, or donate them to nonprofit organizations. How Do You Secure an Ebike? Many ebikes have removable batteries, displays, or built-in wheel locks that make securing your bike much easier. Other bikes, like the Specialized Turbo Vado SL 2, are also compatible with Apple Find My. Check out our Best Ebike Locks guide for more options. Should I Build My Own Bike? Many affordable bikes now come direct-to-consumer—meaning that they are pre-tuned or partially assembled in a box. As Peter Flax recently noted in Bicycling magazine, these bikes do not get nearly the testing or vetting that bikes from a bigger manufacturer get. Unless you're not riding much or for many miles, or are experienced with modifying your own bike, I recommend working with an established manufacturer that has a dealer network. What Terrain Do You Live On? If you live in a flat area, you're probably fine with a 250-watt motor, which is the European speed standard. However, if you live near hills or haul a lot of stuff, you might want to consider a 500-watt or 750-watt motor and a few extras, like hydraulic disc brakes, which will help prevent you from skidding into traffic. How Do I Prevent Bike Fires? The idea of your garage suddenly setting alight is terrifying, but don't worry—the batteries that manufacturers use today are much safer than those of yore. We only write about bikes that have been certified safe by a third-party organization. Also, exercise a bit of common sense. Do not leave your bike battery charging overnight in a boiling hot garage. Don't use aftermarket accessories to charge your bike. And don't plug in a battery that has deformed or smells weird, or try to turn on a bike with a cracked display or computer. Follow Some Basic Safety Tips Not sure where to start? The biking advocacy group PeopleForBikes has a safety education program, E-Bike Smart, which it created in collaboration with the League of American Bicyclists and Bicycle Colorado. Do not let your children ride your bike unsupervised. An 80-pound child should not be piloting a 65-pound bike, even if the motor makes it possible for them to do so. And always wear a helmet, but you already know that. Right? How We Test AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Over the past few years, WIRED's Reviews team has tried almost every kind of electric bike, from the best heavy-duty cargo bikes to high-end mountain bikes. We review upward of 50 new ebikes a year by riding them on a variety of terrain for at least 40 miles over the course of at least two weeks. We test cargo bikes by hauling kids and groceries, we ride mountain and gravel bikes on trails, and we test commuter bikes while running errands on regular city streets (including up and down steep hills). In addition to our real-life testing, we also evaluate specs like weight, tire size, battery life, motor power, and the sourcing of key components. It Costs What Now? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Whenever I talk to anyone about a possible ebike purchase, the biggest deterrent is usually the price. If this is you, check out our guide to the Best Cheap Ebikes. But I do want to say here that these are vehicles, not toys. When I'm carrying my kids to school or flying down a hill at 25 mph, I want the safest possible ride, and I think you should too. Reasonable auto financing options are the only reason a $2,000 electric bike can feel prohibitively expensive while a $6,000 beater gas-powered car has easy monthly payments. Many states now feature incentive programs that offer rebates or tax credits for ebike purchases. Some bike manufacturers and retailers offer financing through companies like Affirm or PayPal. Your bank might cover ebikes under its vehicle loan program, and I also recommend looking at eBay locally, Craigslist, or local Facebook groups. You probably have more options than you think. Ebike Classifications and Rules AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Before you buy your electric bike, make sure you can actually use it! Many cities and states have laws regulating when and where you can ride an ebike. Check out our guide on the three classes of ebikes. At least 22 states now use this three-class system, and they may restrict when and where different classes of ebikes are used, depending on whether they have a throttle or can assist above 20 mph. Cities may also have laws about whether mountain ebikes are allowed on single-track trails. If your state classifies ebikes under the same laws governing motorcycles and mopeds, you may need a license to ride one.

247,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/story/quest-to-make-robot-smell-cancer-dog/,The Quest to Make a Bot That Can Smell as Well as a Dog,2019-05-16T10:00:00+00:00,"The dogs still make Andreas Mershin angry. “I mean, I love dogs,” says the Greek-Russian scientist, in his office at MIT. “But the dogs are slapping me in the face.”

He pulls up a video to show me what he means. In it, a black dog named Lucy approaches a series of six stations, each separated by a small barrier. At every one, a glass cup of human urine with a screened lid sits at the level of the animal’s nose. Lucy takes a brief sniff of each sample, sometimes digging her snout in to get a better whiff. She is performing a kind of diagnostic test: searching for the telltale scent of prostate cancer, which, it turns out, leaves a volatile, discernible signature in a man’s pee. Discernible if you’re a dog, anyway. When Lucy finds what she’s looking for, she sits down and receives a treat.

Among humans—whose toolmaking prowess has given the world self-driving suitcases and reusable rocket boosters—prostate cancer is notoriously difficult to detect. The prevailing method is to check a patient’s blood for elevated levels of a protein called prostate-specific antigen. But the test has a miserable track record. The scientist who first discovered PSA has described the test as “hardly more effective than a coin toss.” A false positive can lead to a prostate biopsy, a harrowing procedure that involves inserting a large, hollow needle through the wall of the rectum to retrieve a tissue sample from the prostate itself.

Properly trained dogs, on the other hand, can detect prostate cancer with better than 90 percent accuracy, and with sleek, tail-­wagging efficiency. In the video, Lucy works her way through six samples in just a couple of minutes. This drives Mershin up the wall. “We have $100 million worth of equipment downstairs. And the dog can beat me?” he says. “That is pissing me off.”

Mershin is not a doctor. He’s a physicist by training. He runs a lab called the Label Free Research Group, which exists to spite the boundaries between physics, biology, materials science, and information science. In his office, Mershin keeps a pair of sunglasses that can measure brain waves, along with magazines on aviation and books on urology, the physics of consciousness, and coding in Python. He speaks rapidly in an accent that sits somewhere between his two native languages, and he changes subjects at the slightest provocation. He refuses to wear matching socks, because why should socks match? He is short and round, with a mane of strawberry blond curls that bounce when he gets excited.

Mershin’s lab, where he keeps that $100 million worth of equipment, sits a few floors down from his office at MIT. In one room, researchers are trying to invent new colors; in another, to create the lightest, strongest materials on earth. But I’m here because this facility is doing some of the most important research in the world toward developing AO—artificial olfaction.

Plenty of robots these days can see, hear, speak, and (crudely) think. But good luck finding one that can smell. In part, that’s simply because olfaction has always been deeply underrated by humans—a species of cerebral, hypervisual snobs. Kant dismissed smell as the “most dispensable” of our five senses. One 2011 poll found that 53 percent of people ages 16 to 22 would rather give up their sense of smell than give up their smartphones and computers.",,"Sara Harrison, Meg Wilcox, Veronique Greenwood, Emily Mullin, Molly Taft, Elise Cutts, Tik Root, Anthony Lydgate, John Semley, Lily Hay Newman","office, dog, lucy, quest, mershin, test, cancer, sits, bot, smell, prostate, dogs",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:51.603620+00:00,955342f36150e38b3efa35001c0c5daa2d424ecab3aa89836c09c5c6ccbd4401

Honorable Mentions

We have tested 100+ mattresses over the years and have removed many that are out-of-stock or out-of-date. Here are a few more products that are still available which we liked but didn't love as much as the ones above.

The Saatva Contour5 for $2,999: The Contour5 is a new offering from Saatva, replacing the popular Loom & Leaf in the company's lineup. Like other Saatva mattresses, but unlike most others on this list, it is not roll-packed and comes delivered on a moving truck. The Contour5 has two firmness options and updated cooling tech that uses airflow channels in its gel foam layer, which is thinner than its predecessor, meaning it retains less heat. In my two weeks of testing, I found the Contour 5 was very good at remaining cool through summer nights, which is extra impressive given that it uses very dense 5-pound-weight memory foam. The Contour5 is soft enough for side sleeping without feeling like a saggy hammock and has excellent build quality, which is impressive for an all-foam mattress without springs. I prefer a hybrid with microcoils, but Saatva is popular for a reason, and as all-foam mattresses go, it has a true luxury feel. —Martin Cizmar. $1,899 to $3,599

The Big Fig Classic for $1,899: The Big Fig is designed for larger body frames. Being a bit overweight myself, I was eager to see how well this mattress, which is advertised as comfortably handling 550 pounds per sleeper, performed. It is a well-built mattress with an effective gel cooling layer; however, the aggressive edge support created a hammock-like feel despite the sturdy springs and three layers of high-density foam in the middle of the mattress. This was true both on my back and on my side. Others may appreciate the effect of sinking a bit into the center of the bed more than I do. —Martin Cizmar. $1,499 to $2,699

The Boring Hybrid Mattress for $799: Boring Mattress is a new company founded by two alums from Tuft & Needle. Simplicity is the company's selling point. There is just one option: the Boring Hybrid Mattress. (You are allowed to pick a size.) This 10-inch hybrid has four layers of both foam and springs. I’m very sensitive to joint pain, and certain beds tend to make it worse, which is why pressure relief is super important for me. Having slept on a variety of different mattresses throughout the years, I was doubtful that this one would work. But I’ve slept on the hybrid mattress for months now and have yet to feel any pain at all. It strikes an excellent balance between firmness and support that my very particular self hasn’t been able to find with other options on the market. It’s worth noting, however, that its layers come equipped with an open-cell design that’s designed to move heat from your body while sleeping. I’m usually cold, so this feature isn’t that important to me. But on nights when I’ve cranked the heat up in my room and woken up sweating a bit, I can’t say it worked all that well for me. This isn’t a deal breaker, but I wouldn’t buy it solely for that. —Brenda Stolyar. $599 to $999

Casper The One for $799: Casper was a leader in the first wave of bed-in-a-box makers in 2014. The company has changed ownership and design a few times over the past decade but last year's launch of The One finds the company keeping pace with competitors. This is an all-foam mattress that stands 11 inches tall. Because it's all foam, it’s on the light side, with a queen weighing an easily movable 66 pounds. One of the main issues with all-foam beds is that they get too hot, but Casper’s The One uses an open-cell foam layer called Breathe Flex Foam on the top, which makes it both pleasantly squishy and breathable. Two more layers of foam add up to a medium-firm feel, with the middle layer designed to cradle your hips, and the base layer designed to provide support. —Martin Cizmar. $749 to $1,698

The Winkbed for $1,499: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu slept on the luxury firm version of the WinkBed for almost two years and he was quite happy in that time. His favorite perk? The edge support is fantastic, so his partner never wakes when he slips into bed late at night. The plush pillowtop also adds a luxe, hotel-like feel to a relatively firm bed. —Martin Cizmar. $1,149 to $2,049

S&S Organic for $1,000: I wouldn't expect this to feel silky-soft, but the latex is something even more supportive for sleep. I love how responsive (read: bouncy) this bed is, especially as someone who tosses and turns often. It's able to move with me so I never feel unsupported, or overheated for that matter. Latex and coils are breathable, as are the organic cotton cover and wool fire barrier are. —Julia Forbes. $800 to $1,300

Nest Bedding Quail for $1,299: When it comes to all-foam mattresses from classic bed-in-a-box brands, I prefer the Casper above, but the Quail by Nest is a nice option if you want an all-foam bed that's a little firmer and you're willing to pay a little more. My biggest issue with the Nest was that despite its claimed cooling system—the foam is infused with minerals and designed with an airflow layer—I did sleep a little hot on it during my week of testing. —Martin Cizmar. $849 to $1,499

Courtesy of Helix Sleep

Helix Sunset Elite for $3,748: Our top pick, Helix, also has an Elite collection that consists of seven mattresses along a spectrum of softness. At 16 inches high, this is ""the tallest mattress on the internet,"" and comes shipped in two separate boxes, each heavy enough to max out FedEx requirements. The firmness is dictated by the foam density of the upper layer, which zips into a larger support system. This makes the mattress adjustable if you end up regretting your order. The bottom section has two separate layers of microcoils. I spent a month sleeping on the softest model from the Elite line, dubbed the Sunset, and appreciated the deep cradling effect. Helix offers a 100-day trial period on all of its mattresses. —Martin Cizmar. $2,499 to $4,499

DreamCloud Hybrid for $1,698: Don't be turned off by that price just yet. This is one mattress that my husband begged me to keep, because the support and pressure relief set the bar so high. It's been one of the most consistently performing mattresses I've tested over the years. And that seemingly high price? DreamCloud runs sales often, so expect to slash that in half. —Julia Forbes. $1,148 to $2,562

Wayfair Sleep 14-Inch Plush Cooling Gel Hybrid Mattress for $410: This plush mattress has a top layer of cooling gel that conforms to your body for comfort and has classic pocket coils below for structure and support, with layers of memory foams with varying thickness surrounding the coils for extra support (the coils and memory foam mixture helps with low motion transfer, too). The top knit cover and sides help with breathability and the overall cooling effect. The mattress is also compatible with an adjustable bed base, has solid edge support, is CertiPUR-US and Oeko-Tex Certified (ensuring no harmful toxins), and has a 10-year warranty. This bed is super comfy if you like a more plush mattress. —Molly Higgins. $400 to $700

Mattresses to Avoid

There are some models you should avoid. Many of these beds are extremely affordable, and if you aren't picky, they may feel fine. In other cases, the mattress is decent but the price is not.

Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Adapt for $2,199: Tempur-Pedic is one of the country's best-known and loved mattress brands, but two separate WIRED reviewers (Martin Cizmar and Nena Farrell) have both disliked different mattresses from the company over the past two years. Nena found the Tempur-Adapt totally lacking in support, and felt like she was sinking into a void when she lay on it. Her spine and muscles both ached after sleeping on it so she gave it to her sister who also hated it, describing it as like sleeping on a leaky air mattress. —Martin Cizmar. $1,699 to $3,398

Magniflex Magnistretch 12 for $4,399: This mattress is Italian-made and advertises itself as stretching the spine. It’s endorsed by retired Italian soccer player Giorgio Chiellini and current pro basketballer Stefano Tonut, who plays for the Italian equivalent of the Boston Celtics. Well, the Magniflex definitely does something to the spine, though I found it very unwelcome. (It's worth noting that I am not the same Martin Cizmar who played a little pro soccer in Slovakia.) I lasted only two nights on the Magnistretch before crying uncle and limping over to my next tester. The morning-after sensation was as if I'd slept on a hammock made of chainlink fence, and my lower back was left feeling weak and creaky—very possibly it was stretched, and if so, it turns out I don't like having my back stretched. —Martin Cizmar. $3,699 to $5,299

Sleep Number Climate360 Smart Bed for $10,249: This bed can be temperature-controlled, which is amazing. The adjustable base means you can be comfortable when watching TV, reading, or sleeping. Unfortunately, the price tag has too many digits, and sleep experts recommend avoiding electronic usage before bed—advice the Sleep IQ app defies. Did we mention it costs as much as a used Buick and the weight is not far behind? —Martin Cizmar. $10,249 to $14,449

Amazon Basics mattress for $170 (Twin): This one is made of cheap foam that isn't dense enough, causing too much sinkage. —Martin Cizmar. $170 to $436

Parachute Eco Comfort Mattress for $2,650: This mattress just doesn't live up to its extravagant price. The model we tested didn't have enough proper padding above its coils. —Martin Cizmar. $1,550 to $2,850

Frequently Asked Questions How We Test Mattresses AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED has tested mattresses since 2019. The very first version of our buying guide was made by sourcing two dozen beds and having our staff lay on them in a conference room to pick a favorite. But anyone who has bought a few beds in person from a mattress store can tell you the mattress you prefer when lounging in a well-lit store at 4 pm may not be the mattress you want while trying to get a few last winks at 4 am. We subsequently learned that there is no substitute for actually sleeping on tester mattresses in our own homes. We don't rely on surveys of random shoppers or labs with falling bowling balls to make our recommendations. We bring each bed into our homes for at least seven nights of real-life testing. Only after a week of good, restful sleep—as our lead reviewer I have personally tested 40-plus beds in the past two years—will we recommend a product. Everything we test gets at least a few nights to make a positive impression, but when we decide we hate a product we will stop short of testing it for seven nights and get ourselves some better sleep. How Firm or Soft Should Your Mattress Be? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The biggest decision in every mattress purchase is how firm to go. Generally, heavier people and back sleepers or stomach sleepers will do better with firmer beds, while lighter people and side sleepers enjoy softer. Temperature is also an issue: Softer mattresses sleep warmer since your body is sinking into a layer of fabric and foam. Keep in mind that all mattresses have a break-in period, and the way the mattress feels on your first night won't be how it feels after a week or two. It's also worth considering that if you buy a firmer mattress and want to soften it up, a mattress topper is a great option—we've got a full guide to the best—but it's much harder to make a soft mattress firmer. Should You Wait for a Sale? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Mattresses go on sale often—Presidents’ Day has somehow become the biggest sale day of the year, as famously mentioned on Nate Bargatze's Saturday Night Live skit. Labor Day and Memorial Day also somehow become mattress sale holidays. Additionally, online mattresses are often advertised as being on sale perennially. There's a strong chance you can save hundreds of dollars by waiting for the next big sale event. WIRED covers all of these sales and carefully tracks prices throughout the year so we can alert you to the best actual deals as opposed to “sales” that are not much different than the normal asking price. Can You Set Up a Bed-in-a-Box by Yourself? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Take it from someone who has dealt with dozens over the past year: Bed-in-a-box mattresses delivered by FedEx are relatively easy to deal with. Most of these mattresses are delivered vacuum-sealed and rolled up. Some are pretty heavy—up to 150 pounds—and if you're ordering one of those, be sure someone is there to help you. After you unroll your bed-in-a-box mattress and cut the vacuum bag open, it'll immediately begin to inflate, so unbox it on your bed frame or near it. We have a helpful guide on how to set up the mattress you bought online with more tips. The mattresses are usually ready to go in a few hours, but most manufacturers recommend giving them two days to reach their normal state. What if You Don't Like the Mattress You Bought Online? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Most of the picks we've tested and recommend have at least a 100-night testing period and a 10-year warranty. Before you buy, be sure to look at the company's policy as you may be on the hook for a nominal return fee. Set yourself a reminder a few days before the return deadline to make a final assessment. Should You Buy a Hybrid or an All-Foam? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Old school mattresses were made of springs with thin layers of foam and cloth and usually sat on a box spring. Bed-in-a-box mattresses, on the other hand, are either foam or hybrids that layer foam with built-in springs. (I have never tested one that required a box spring.) We tend to recommend hybrids because they are more stable and supportive, and they usually stay cooler because the springs leave room for airflow. Hybrids are often slightly pricier. Foam mattresses tend to be softer, lighter, and cheaper. What Size Mattress Should You Buy? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron The prices in our guide are based on the queen size, which is the most popular size in the US. But everything we've included comes in various standard sizes, usually standard twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, and California king. You'll want to buy based on the size of your bed frame. Are Online Mattresses Safe? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Mattresses sold in the US are subject to consumer protection rules on things like flammability and have requirements for tags that show when and where they were made (you remember the verbiage that says you can't remove tags under penalty of law, which has inspired generations of comedians). Any mattress you buy online should be safe, but it's always better to do business with reputable companies. How does WIRED acquire the mattresses to test? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron There are a couple of ways we get mattresses into our testing queue. Often brands reach out to introduce themselves. Sometimes we see a mattress has been given a great review by a competitor and we want to test for ourselves. All of the beds on the current vesion of this story were provided as free samples by each of the brands you see here, with the exception of Wayfair and Amazon Basics which WIRED purchased. What does WIRED do with the mattresses after testing them? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron WIRED's Reviews team is always testing new mattresses, cycling through about 50 in a year. We recently hired a dedicated sleep writer, Julia Forbes, to help keep pace with testing needs. The majority of beds are considered “samples” and are sent to us for free by companies hoping to be given a good review. We don't keep them though. We are happy to send them back. Mattress companies cannot resell used mattresses and shipping is expensive, so this is rarely the path them choose. Once testing is through and all data has been recorded, our team passes them on to the community without getting any personal benefit. Commerce director Martin Cizmar has given away dozens of mattresses on Facebook Mareketplace—if you're in Kansas City and need a free lightly used mattress keep your eyes peeled. We also purchase (and expense) some mattresses we want to test. We won't say we like something we don't based on the commission rate. What should you look for when buying a mattress? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron This may seem like a vague question, but it's actually requiring you to do some introspection. You'll need to honestly ask yourself about your body type, sleeping position(s) of choice, the materials you want, and other checklist items. From there, this will help you hone in on the bed that best fits you—with expert advice from our team along the way, of course. What are mattress certifications? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We actually have a whole article outlining the various certifications associated with different mattress materials. In a nutshell though, these are the baseline qualifications ensured by a third-party evaluation so that there is no sway. Qualifications ensure things like memory foam don't contain chemicals that could harm you, or that questionable substances aren't present in a finished mattress.

It wasn’t. The former corporate executive from Colorado retired in 2006 after an MRI revealed his spine was riddled with a dozen tumors called hemangiomas, which later spread to his brain. Todd was told he would die before the end of 2008.

Somehow, Todd has survived—he credits medical marijuana, which he now uses daily—but he is still considered terminal. “It could be tomorrow. It could be five years from now,” he says in a call.

However, the 54-year-old spent the past decade plagued by a host of mental health problems, including PTSD and treatment-resistant depression. He was suicidal and tormented by violent night terrors. Nothing, not even massive doses of Xanax or Valium, could temper his panic attacks or end-of-life anxiety.

“My mental condition was deteriorating rapidly, and I was on [antidepressant] medication No. 14 and it wasn’t working,” Todd says. “My psychiatrist said, ‘I honestly think you're a big candidate for psychedelics.’”

That was about a year ago. Todd began taking homegrown psilocybin, the highly illegal alkaloid in so-called magic mushrooms. Known for prompting profound hallucinations, psilocybin was placed in the restrictive Schedule I category in 1970, meaning the US government recognizes no medical use for the drug and says that it carries a high risk of abuse.

Todd says there have been clear benefits from psilocybin with few side effects. He hasn’t had a single PTSD episode since he began taking it. His depression evaporated. The mushrooms even help ease the pain—agony that feels like being “shot in the back”—from the nerve-crushing tumors in his spine and skull.

“It’s knocked that out, it’s wiped that slate clean,” Todd says. The day before we talked, he’d eaten eight grams of fungus. A heavy dose is considered five grams, so this was no psychedelic snack—but Todd ingests this much about every week.

The experience is positively hypnagogic, allowing trippers to enter a dreamlike conscious state where time is distorted, color is amplified, and depth perception is warped. Euphoric, unbridled laughter is common, as are oddly introspective thoughts about existence and reality, and even synesthetic sensations, such as being able to “see” sounds. A trip can last four to six hours.

There can be negative effects as well, such as nausea, dizziness, paranoia, or panic attacks, but Todd doesn’t experience those. He still takes 10 milligrams of escitalopram, an antidepressant, and when the mushrooms wear off, 30 milligrams of the opioid oxycodone, but otherwise his prescription drug intake has drastically decreased.

Todd asked me not to use his real name, fearful that his health insurance provider could sever benefits because he uses illicit substances. But his doctors are aware and supportive of his psychedelic drug use, he says, which may legally exempt him under the federal Right To Try Act for terminally ill patients, signed by President Trump last May.

Indeed, magic mushrooms are having a therapeutic moment. In North America, at least four organizations, each with unique strategies, are working to expand access to psilocybin for anyone with mental health issues, dying or not. These groups hope to undo decades of psilocybin prohibition by removing criminal penalties for possession or cultivation, or by providing access to psilocybin in a therapist’s offices, or both.",,"Troy Farah, John Semley, Lexi Pandell, Emily Mullin, Veronique Greenwood, Molly Taft, Will Knight, Anthony Lydgate, Jake Lahut, Vittoria Elliott","legalize, wasnt, uses, psilocybin, mental, ptsd, depression, taking, push, health, todd, magic, drug, mushrooms, working",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:50.791971+00:00,03043ba4e4d3f2d9a83f63bcef58347b3113d2999cf83ac66d50224ebe050ab5

He was holding a radio. “Oh, shit,” Farmer thought, figuring the border police had sent word up the road. He put his head down. All Ward could make out were heated words between the taxi driver and the stranger. “What’s going on?” he asked. “Shut up,” Farmer said, “I’m trying to listen.” Karl was completely still in the back seat, wondering how he’d gotten himself into this situation. The yelling stopped and the car started moving again. “Turned out that was a politician trying to commandeer this taxi,” Farmer explained to Ward and Karl. “He had no idea who we were.”

They carried on along the road and eventually reached a border crossing on the shore of Lake Titicaca, where they stepped onto a ferry that would take them to Bolivia. By now the sun was rising over the Andes, bringing up the blue of the lake. Below, the water was visible through the warped deck boards of the ancient barge. The crossing takes more than an hour, and by the time they stopped at Isla del Sol, an island just inside of Bolivia, they started to feel safe.

Seventeen days earlier, a massive stone had careened over this lake, a fittingly Empyrean setting for such a grand celestial appearance. Farmer, Ward, and Karl had come all this way to find a visitor from the stars, only to be confronted by a small but swift maelstrom of very terrestrial habits: fear and anger, hope and disappointment, opportunism and greed. Farmer had been at such pains to reassure everyone else that the rock was not dangerous, but in the end it had summoned enough danger to force him and his partners to flee.

The Aymara pray to their gods at this lake. In the distance was Amantani, an island where Pachamama receives offerings for a bountiful harvest. The meteorite hunters might not talk about it this way, but they too were here to find fortune from the sky. And for a brief moment they thought they’d found it. Feast or famine from above, the enduring human tradition.

In a way, the hunters’ obsession is almost mystical itself, imbuing their rocks with an aura built on belief. Both science and superstition attributed something special to the meteorite, and therein resided its spiritual or material worth. Its value was an expression of faith. Even at their deepest rationalist moments, the meteorite hunters are hoping for life to be changed by celestial intervention.

They were here to find fortune falling from the sky. Feast or famine from above, the enduring human tradition.

The group arrived on the Bolivian shore in a small town that they were surprised to discover was called Copacabana. “Quite unlike the one in Rio,” Farmer said. His joke was greeted with silence. They headed for La Paz, where they checked into their hotel and found an email from the vice consul to the US embassy in Lima. It turned out the US authorities thought the trio had been arrested, and Peruvian news was claiming that they were already in custody there. Farmer assured the consul they were not, in fact, in jail; they had evaded capture and were heading back to the United States.

It wasn’t until Farmer got to Miami that he reached Melody, who was glad to hear from him, even if they were coming home practically empty-handed. After all, they had not made the career-­defining recovery they imagined. They lamented what was lost. But if the desire for divine intervention is eternal, so is the wait. Everyone, in some way, is hoping that their own rock will fall from the sky—that thing which brings riches and fame or transforms failures into successes and sorrows into joy, the existential alembic that makes ordinary life extraordinary. And for all their smarts and pluck, Farmer, Ward, and Karl had just learned what we already know deep in our hearts: Destiny is not determined by the stars. The odds of that stone landing where it did were calculated at 1 in 182 trillion. They didn’t get the rock—and typically we don’t get ours either.",,"Joshuah Bearman, Allison Keeley, Molly Longman, Katie Drummond, Becky Ferreira, Emily Mullin, Luca Nardi, Mark Harris, Lexi Pandell, Molly Taft","road, reached, lake, way, scramble, mad, claim, ward, karl, thought, taxi, farmer, worlds, meteorite, coveted",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:49.964830+00:00,7f0f7b451d527db6cf2752e963befa879d8e9279e856c1ee30a8d8912dc1f9dc

There are so many good TVs available, we can't add them all to our top list. Here are some great options that either missed the cut or got knocked off our top list by their replacements.

Hisense U8QG: The U8QG (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great buy at its lowest price (around $1,000 for a 65-inch model) and a solid pick above that price, especially if you want eye-searing brightness above all else. I noticed some SDR color accuracy issues (some images looked way too red) and found it difficult to keep it from wildly over-brightening some content. Thankfully, you can always turn it down, and its nuclear power plant is paired with excellent black levels, deep contrast, and plenty of features. I actually prefer last year's similarly punchy U8N (8/10, WIRED Recommends), but it's getting harder to find in stock.

TCL QM7K (2025): I’ve had a love/hate relationship with the QM7K. Part of TCL's new Precise Dimming series, its opulent black levels and contrast reach toward OLED heights, matched by good brightness for some spectacular moments. The problem? My review model’s colors were off-kilter, with an odd green tint in select black and grayscale content. Thankfully, I confirmed that TCL's latest firmware update fixed the issue. The TV's picture processing and colors still don't catch premium TVs, and this is the second year in a row I've found a troubling performance issue with the QM7. You shouldn't buy it at full price, but if you can get the 65-inch model for $1,000 or less, it's an enticing choice.

Hisense U7N: If you’re after a TV at similar pricing to the QM6K but with some extra eye tingle, last year's Hisense U7N (8/10, WIRED Recommends) offers a serious brightness boost over our top pick and still ranks among our favorite options for your money. Its blooming control and screen uniformity aren’t as refined as the QM6K's but it’s got plenty of features, including great gaming credentials and a streamlined Google TV interface. It's still a great buy while stock lasts, especially at $700 or less.

Sony A95L: Sony finally replaced this sweet screen with the 2025 Bravia 8 II, which offers similarly incredible picture processing and upscaling alongside enhanced colors and higher HDR brightness. That shouldn't deter you from considering the A95L (9/10, WIRED Recommends) at a lower price. With fabulously immersive image quality and an intuitive Google TV interface, this is a premium package that's very enticing on a good sale.

Sony Bravia 7: The Bravia 7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a gorgeous display, offering brilliant brightness, naturalistic colors, and suave finesse in the subtle details. Its biggest knock is very poor off-axis viewing, which could be tough to swallow at its high list price. Otherwise, it's worth considering for fans of that Sony glow, especially since Sony seems to be discounting its best QLED TVs much more liberally than its OLED models.

Other TVs We've Tested

Samsung The Frame Pro: I put the Frame Pro through our full review process and came away both in limbo due to software issues and (so far) unimpressed with the performance. The matte screen looks slick when displaying art, especially if you purchase one of the add-on frames (a frame for the Frame?) from Samsung or Deco TV Frames. Picture performance was otherwise middling at best. It's much brighter than the traditional Frame and the colors pop, but its edge-lit mini LED system does not look good with dark 4K HDR content, even in the day. Moreover, I had trouble with its very sluggish operating system (which others have reported) and stuttering Blu-ray playback. We're awaiting a second model, which we hope relieves the software issues, but steer clear for now.

TCL QM7: There's only one thing holding back 2024's beautifully balanced QM7 (6/10, WIRED Reviewed): a software glitch. During my review, I experienced an issue where adjusting SDR backlight levels affected HDR, which can lead to severe brightness limitations. While TCL fixed the issue in a firmware update for me, I never got confirmation on a broader OTA fix. Most folks probably won't have this issue, so the QM7 is still worth considering, but make sure and check it before throwing out the box.

Photograph: Parker Hall

There are a lot of great soundbars out there, and we don’t have room to feature them all. Here are some others you might want to consider.

LG's S95TR for $1,000-1,500: LG's 9.1.5-channel soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) doesn't perform as well as Samsung's flagship Q990 series, but it could be a better choice for those with newer LG TVs like the C4, which can connect wirelessly and use its speakers in tandem with the bar for more immersion. It also supports gaming features like 120-Hz pass-through, but only includes one spare input.

Sony Bravia Theater 9 for $1,400: Sony’s follow-up to the potent HT-A7000 flagship soundbar regresses in some key ways. There are fewer inputs (no more analog), a more mundane fabric-wrapped design, and minimal sound settings. The Theater 9's leaner frame equates to a less meaty and immersive soundstage, but this is still a Sony flagship soundbar, which means great musicality, superb detail, and advanced spatial imaging for 3D audio. Premium features like an HDMI 2.1 input for connecting modern game consoles and advanced integration with newer Sony TVs sweeten the deal, but at $1,400, it’s a pricey proposition.

Vizio 2.1 Soundbar (SV210M) for $170: Vizio’s curvy little combo brings enticing value, with solid sound quality and some cinematic punch from the teensiest subwoofer you’ll ever see. There’s no optical input or remote included, but the Vizio app makes adjusting settings or swapping to Bluetooth simple enough. The main drawback is that dialog sometimes (but not always) gets lost, reducing the main draw of a cheap soundbar. That said, good musical chops and features like DTS Virtual X expansion make it worth considering on sale.

Samsung HW-Q800C for $598: If Samsung's HW-Q990C everything bar is too rich for your blood, the two-piece HW-Q800C (8/10, WIRED Recommends) could be a good compromise. This bar offers a similar sound signature as Samsung's flagship bars and many of the same features, packed into a smaller bar-and-subwoofer combo for a notable discount–especially since it's now almost always on sale.

Sennheiser Ambeo Mini for $700: This pint-sized luxury bar is great for those with money to burn in very small spaces. Sennheiser's built-in Ambeo virtualization technology brilliantly throws sound all around you for exhilarating TV shows and movies, and offers advanced features like support for Google Assistant and Alexa.

Sony HT-X8500 for $300: Sony's HT-X8500 is getting harder to find, but it's still one of our favorite options for those after a single bar with solid bass response and expansive sound, including decent Dolby Atmos virtualization. While it's pricier than our top bar, it's a great alternative for those after a bit more, and worth considering while it's still available.

Sennheiser Ambeo Plus for $1,200: Given the price and the physical dimensions of the soundbar—which doesn't even include a subwoofer—the Ambeo Plus might look like a poor deal. But thanks to its 400 watts of power and its nine carefully developed and even more carefully positioned drivers, this Sennheiser is capable of big, enveloping sound with a strong suggestion of the sonic height that Dolby Atmos soundtracks thrive on. By way of an encore, it turns out to be a hugely capable wireless speaker when you want to listen to some music, too. —Simon Lucas

The Polk React for $269: This soundbar works if you want to get surround sound eventually but don’t have the cash right now. The Alexa-enabled soundbar is fine on its own, with surround speakers and subwoofers available from Polk if you want to upgrade.

How to Connect Your Soundbar AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We’ve included a list of available connectivity options next to every soundbar on our list. Most soundbars will connect to your TV via optical or HDMI cables, though the optical input is starting to go away for newer models, including even pricey flagship options. In most cases, HMDI is the preferable connection anyway. If your TV and soundbar both have an HDMI ARC/eARC port (the cable port looks like regular HDMI, but it’s labeled ARC or eARC), connect it that way. It will allow you to use the volume buttons on your TV remote to control the soundbar’s volume. Also, make sure CEC is enabled. Use an optical cable only if HDMI isn’t available, as HDMI is also necessary for Dolby Atmos and other 3D audio formats. Finally, check your TV audio menus to make sure your TV’s internal speakers are set to off (so you don’t get any weird audio fluttering) and find the best spots to place your speakers and sub. Why You Need a Soundbar AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron We have yet to test a new TV that didn’t sound better with an audio accessory. That’s mostly due to the way televisions are designed. Great-sounding speakers are bulky, and as TVs have gotten thinner with shrinking bezels and sleeker designs, manufacturers are having a harder time building good speakers into them. You can spend as little as $100 to $150 on a new soundbar, and it’s essential to getting the most out of your TV experience. Our list of the best soundbars we’ve tested includes soundbars sold on their own and models that come bundled with a subwoofer and surround speakers at a wide variety of price points. Are Soundbars as Good as Speakers? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron Stumble onto any A/V or home theater subreddit or forum and you’ll see a mob of people claiming even the idea of a soundbar matching up to a pair of speakers is heresy. The truth, as far as we’re concerned, is that it all depends on your individual wants and needs. If you’re looking for the most musical bang for your buck, especially when it comes to hi-res audio and vinyl record collections, a great pair of bookshelf speakers is likely your best value option. Even if you’re not keen on shopping for an amp and running speaker wires, our best bookshelf speakers guide offers plenty of powered/active pairs that include all the inputs and amplification built-in, like a soundbar system for audiophiles. That may not be the best option for everybody, though. If you’re just after something cheap and simple to soup up your TV sound, or conversely, a convenient way to explore exciting audio formats like surround sound and Dolby Atmos, a soundbar could be the perfect choice. Soundbars are affordable and hassle-free solutions, many of which offer sound and features that may match your needs better than a pair of speakers or a traditional home theater setup. We take no sides here, we just love good sound and great features. For many, a soundbar is the best way to get there. Do You Need a Subwoofer? AccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron This is a question only you can answer, but there are a few points to consider before making a call, starting with your living space. If you live in a smaller apartment or multiplex, a subwoofer may not be the best choice due to both its size and its likelihood of arousing noise complaints. Larger modern soundbars have gotten increasingly good at reproducing convincing bass from a single bar, often utilizing multiple speakers in concert to bring more punch to lower frequencies without causing lots of boom and bombast. If you're less concerned about close quarters and looking for more cinematic punch, you should highly consider a soundbar with a subwoofer. Physics can only be stretched so far, and no multi-speaker system we’ve heard can match the punch and potency of a dedicated large driver and acoustic cabinet. Even many affordable soundbar models include a subwoofer. If you want full-throttle sound, we suggest considering going all in for a subwoofer, or at the very least a bar that allows you to add one later.

We test a ton of Android phones. We like the ones below, but you'll be better off with one of the options above. If you haven't yet done so, check out our Best Cheap Phones and Best Folding Phones guides for more.

Pixel 9 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu

Google Pixel 9 for $599: The Pixel 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a great smartphone, but between the Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9 Pro series, it struggles to stand out. It shares many features with its pricier siblings, but you can get a very similar experience with the Pixel 9a, all while saving hundreds of dollars. I would hold off until the Pixel 10 launches.

Galaxy Z Flip7

Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 for $1,100: Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) got some great upgrades over its predecessor, but it wasn't enough to dethrone the Razr Ultra 2025 as my top flip phone pick. Still, it's worth considering if you're shopping for a folding phone of this category, because the cameras are solid, the displays are excellent and larger than ever, and the cover screen is a little more useful (though not as versatile as on Motorola's phone). Battery life is even worse here over the Fold7, so snag a power bank while you're at it.

Galaxy S25 Edge Photograph: Julian Chokkattu

Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge for $970: Samsung's latest innovation is to slim down the smartphone to an amazingly thin 5.8 mm. That's not as impressive as phones from the past, but the Galaxy S25 Edge (6/10, WIRED Recommends) is still impressive when you hold this lightweight 6.7-inch phone in your hand. It maintains several features from the Galaxy S25 Ultra, except there's no S Pen stylus, no telephoto cameras whatsoever, and battery life is not good at all for a phone of this size and price. I routinely had to keep it topped up throughout the day. But if you're an average to light user, you may find it sufficient, and maybe you'll be able to appreciate the thin and light size even more.

Nothing Phone (3a) for $379 and Phone (3a) Pro for $459: Here's another well-rounded smartphone that doesn't have an exorbitant price. The Nothing Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are sub-$500 Android phones, and they are both fantastic. They're identical in every way except the cameras, where the Pro model has a slight advantage in zoom and low-light capabilities. I think the Phone (3a) looks nicer and is a better value. Run through the list of specs and you'll be hard-pressed to find fault with the hardware. The display is wonderfully smooth with its 120-Hz refresh rate, and it's no struggle to see in the sun. Performance is snappy, battery life is reliable, and the camera quality is decent for the money. There are some drawbacks—these phones are only IP64-rated, so don't drop them in the pool. There's no wireless charging, and connectivity isn't seamless. While it'll work best on T-Mobile, you'll only get 4G on Verizon and AT&T until you ask the carriers to whitelist the device for 5G access. That process is sure to be frustrating.

Samsung Galaxy S24 FE for $550: Samsung's Galaxy S24 FE is a better buy now that the flagship Galaxy S24 series is harder to find for sale. It's a perfectly capable smartphone with a triple-camera array (including a 3X telephoto camera), and it delivers good performance. It has wireless charging, is IP68 water resistant, and has solid day-long battery life. It's a shame the design’s a bit drab. Alternatively, you can try to find the flagship Galaxy S24 series on sale: the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, and Galaxy S24 Ultra are still excellent devices, but make sure you don't spend anywhere near their MSRP.

Moto G Power 2025 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu

Motorola Moto G Power 2025 for $300: The new Moto G Power (7/10, WIRED Recommends) isn't as great as its predecessor, and that comes down to one reason: Due to a lesser chipset, there's a slight hit in performance, and it feels a bit more sluggish to use. However, the performance is good enough that you won’t feel frustrated. Outside of this, it's a remarkable $300 phone. The green faux leather back exudes luxury, and it's nice and slim. The cameras are solid, and the 6.8-inch LCD screen has a 120-Hz screen refresh rate and gets plenty bright. Best of all, the company retained the wireless charging it debuted in last year's model, making it one of the only sub-$300 phones with this convenience. Another area of improvement? It's IP68/69-rated, so you won't have to baby this phone near a pool; it can handle a dip just fine. Motorola has also extended software updates on the Moto G series, promising two Android OS upgrades, with the same three years of security updates. There's a fair amount of bloatware, but you can remove most of these preinstalled apps.

ROG Phone 9 Photograph: Julian Chokkattu

Asus ROG Phone 9 for $1,000: The ROG phone series is for serious gamers. There are two USB-C ports, so you can charge the phone comfortably even while using it in landscape mode for gaming. It has perks like a headphone jack and a bevy of accessories you can attach, like a cooler and a mobile controller, to enhance the gaming experience. Unfortunately, other aspects of this phone struggle to match the high price—the software can feel clunky, and the cameras are not at all what you'd expect at this price level.

Minimal Phone Photograph: Julian Chokkattu

Minimal Phone for $399: Having trouble curbing your screen time? Instead of going cold turkey with something like the Light Phone III, try the Minimal Phone (6/10, WIRED Review). This is an e-paper Android phone with a physical keyboard. The goal is to let you access the usual Android apps, but because the screen is ill-suited to videos and most social media, you'll naturally be able to avoid those distractions. It's successful in this task, but the constant screen ghosting and plasticky build dampen the experience.

Mobile Accessories You Might Need

Photograph: Julian Chokkattu

We have case recommendations for a few popular devices, like Samsung's Galaxy S25, Galaxy S24, and Galaxy S23, or Google's Pixel 9 series. It's smart to slap a case on these glass sandwiches and even a screen protector to keep the display free of scuffs and scratches. Here are a few other noteworthy accessories, including charging adapters, which many phones don't include anymore. Read our Best USB-C Cables guide for other recommendations.

Anker 45-Watt Charger for $28: This tiny charger will be enough for most people to charge most smartphones. It's compact, reliable, and cheap, plus the prongs fold up. More smartphones than ever can go up to 45-watt charging speeds, so take advantage with a 45-watt charger.

Counterpart Retractable The Charger for $44: It's not the best value, but this design-forward charger has a retractable 4-foot cable that makes it a fantastic two-in-one—no need to pack a separate charger and cable! It outputs 35 watts, which is plenty to fast-charge most phones and tablets, and the prongs fold in for travel.

Peak Design Samsung and Pixel Everyday Case for $50: If you have a Samsung or Pixel phone and you frequently mount your phone to a bike or scooter, you owe it to yourself to snag this case and Peak Design's bike mount. The case snaps perfectly into the mount, is dead simple to release, and has yet to fall off after years of riding. Peak Design also sells several other accessories you can attach to the back of these cases, bringing Android into Apple's MagSafe ecosystem.

Nimble Champ Portable Charger 10,000 mAh for $60: This portable battery is small enough to leave in a bag but has enough power to fully recharge your phone once or twice. There's a USB-C and USB-A port; it delivers 18 watts of power, so it can recharge your tablet or phone, and it's housed in 73 percent post-consumer plastic with plastic-free packaging.

Nomad ChargeKey V2 for $25: When your phone dies, it's almost always when you forget to bring a charger or battery pack. The ChargeKey is a nifty solution—it's like clipping a tiny USB-C charging cable to your keychain. Just plug one end into your phone and the other into any kind of power source (a friend's phone or a charging adapter if you manage to find one), and you can top up your phone. Native Union also has a similar item that's cuter but nearly as capable.

248,wired.com,https://www.wired.com/2010/06/ff-sergeys-search/,Sergey Brin’s Search for a Parkinson’s Cure,2010-06-22T16:00:45+00:00,"Several evenings a week, after a day's work at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, Sergey Brin drives up the road to a local pool. There, he changes into swim trunks, steps out on a 3-meter springboard, looks at the water below, and dives.

Brin is competent at all four types of springboard diving—forward, back, reverse, and inward. Recently, he's been working on his twists, which have been something of a struggle. But overall, he's not bad; in 2006 he competed in the master's division world championships. (He's quick to point out he placed sixth out of six in his event.)

The diving is the sort of challenge that Brin, who has also dabbled in yoga, gymnastics, and acrobatics, is drawn to: equal parts physical and mental exertion. ""The dive itself is brief but intense,"" he says. ""You push off really hard and then have to twist right away. It does get your heart rate going.""

There's another benefit as well: With every dive, Brin gains a little bit of leverage—leverage against a risk, looming somewhere out there, that someday he may develop the neurodegenerative disorder Parkinson's disease. Buried deep within each cell in Brin's body—in a gene called LRRK2, which sits on the 12th chromosome—is a genetic mutation that has been associated with higher rates of Parkinson's.

Not everyone with Parkinson's has an LRRK2 mutation; nor will everyone with the mutation get the disease. But it does increase the chance that Parkinson's will emerge sometime in the carrier's life to between 30 and 75 percent. (By comparison, the risk for an average American is about 1 percent.) Brin himself splits the difference and figures his DNA gives him about 50-50 odds.

That's where exercise comes in. Parkinson's is a poorly understood disease, but research has associated a handful of behaviors with lower rates of disease, starting with exercise. One study found that young men who work out have a 60 percent lower risk. Coffee, likewise, has been linked to a reduced risk. For a time, Brin drank a cup or two a day, but he can't stand the taste of the stuff, so he switched to green tea. (""Most researchers think it's the caffeine, though they don't know for sure,"" he says.) Cigarette smokers also seem to have a lower chance of developing Parkinson's, but Brin has not opted to take up the habit. With every pool workout and every cup of tea, he hopes to diminish his odds, to adjust his algorithm by counteracting his DNA with environmental factors.

""This is all off the cuff,"" he says, ""but let's say that based on diet, exercise, and so forth, I can get my risk down by half, to about 25 percent."" The steady progress of neuroscience, Brin figures, will cut his risk by around another half—bringing his overall chance of getting Parkinson's to about 13 percent. It's all guesswork, mind you, but the way he delivers the numbers and explains his rationale, he is utterly convincing.",,"Thomas Goetz, Molly Taft, Lily Hay Newman, Anthony Lydgate, Emily Mullin, Jennifer Ouellette, Ars Technica, Tik Root, Veronique Greenwood, Elise Cutts","mutation, lower, brins, exercise, disease, brin, parkinsons, hes, chance, cure, work, sergey, search, risk",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:52.473170+00:00,25006c0efb9d0e91aeb1e2963d58f462704f92f1a1007edb1bab3a15b0d82069

It delivers high-level performance and a 2K display that'll make both groups smile, while giving users a way to tone down the RGB lighting via Stealth Mode.

You'll need to keep that charger close by, as the M16 R2's battery doesn't last very long. $1,899.99 at Best Buy $2,049 at Amazon more buying choices

Gaming laptops are often on the cutting edge of technology, housing some of the industry's best hardware. Powerful Meteor Lake processors, visually stunning RTX 40-series GPUs, the works. With that in mind, you'd think that professionals looking for high-end machines would be clamoring to buy one of these machines for themselves, but that's not really the case. Gaming laptops aren't exactly ubiquitous, but why? Well, it might have to do with their flashy RGB lights that light up like Disney's Electrical Parade.

Also: One of the best work laptops I've tested has MacBook written all over it (but it's even better)

Gaming devices often come equipped with RGB lighting, which looks cool, but can be pretty distracting, especially when you're in a work meeting trying to look serious and have a laptop lit up like a Christmas tree in front of you. Subtlety is the name of the game here. Thankfully, manufacturers are taking notice of this potential shift in customer preference. Dell, for one, has come up with a solution in a new gaming laptop that also has the working professional in mind: the Alienware m16 R2.

I am a big fan of Dell's design choices here. The m16 R2 strikes a good balance of looking aesthetically cool while also maintaining practicality. On the outside, you have a shiny dark gray exterior with a stylized number 16 and an Alienware logo at the top. You'll notice there isn't a big thermal shelf jutting out; the heat vents are flush with the display when positioned upright. Ditching the shelf makes this laptop easier to carry compared to bulkier models. Owners will need all the help they can get since the m16 R2 isn't easy to carry around; it weighs nearly six pounds.

On the inside is a matte black keyboard. The RGB lighting on this dark background makes the colors stand out nicely. Typing on the keyboard was a pleasure, too. The matte surface is smooth to the touch, and the keys all have a springy feel to them. I'm a sucker for a comfy keyboard, but the comfort level isn't what I like most about the m16's keyboard. If you look closely at the function keys, you'll notice different icons than what you would see on a standard keyboard, as they have unique functionalities made specifically for this laptop.

Also: Finally, an ultraportable Windows laptop I'd use at the office (even though it's for gamers)

F2 is the most useful in my opinion since it activates Stealth Mode. The mode causes the RGB lights to instantly turn white, making the machine look more like a generic work laptop. This is super useful for when you're in a public setting and don't want to attract attention to yourself. Pressing F1, on the other hand, activates Performance Mode. Hitting the button while gaming forces the hardware to instantly perform better by defaulting the hardware to preset settings optimized for gaming. The problem with this mode is that it also immediately activates the cooling fans, and they're quite loud. At least the fans do work well at keeping the laptop from overheating.

F4, F5, and F6 are for keybinds, letting you tie custom actions to them, with F3 reserved for saving your keybinds. All the usual audio control functions have been moved to the far right. Besides the keyboard, I enjoy how the edge of the palm rest at the front of the machine is noticeably round. It's softer on the wrists when compared to other laptops, ensuring a comfortable typing experience. Features like these allow the m16 R2 to pull double duty at being a gaming and work-centric laptop and indicate that Dell put a lot of thought into designing the model.

One thing worth noting, though, is that I did find the trackpad to be a little small. Perhaps they wanted to make room for the speakers above the keyboard, in which case I say it was a worthwhile move since the audio sounds great for a laptop. Just keep in mind that they're not powerful enough to fill a room.

Also: I tested Dell's XPS successor, and it made my $3,000 Windows laptop look bad

The Alienware m16 R2 runs on an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, a processor I notice is commonly found on many 2024 laptops. It's a good option as it offers solid performance while not inflating the price tag too much. To see what it's capable of, I ran it through the Geekbench test, where the processor earned a score of 12,725, outperforming the Ultra 9's average score of 12,611. So on the right laptop, the Ultra 7 can be the better chip than the higher-end hardware.

Alongside the CPU are the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card and 16GB of RAM, though it would've been nice to have 32GB. I experienced a dip in performance when I was playing Helldivers 2 at high graphical settings. But 16GB is fine; it gets the job done in most situations.

Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET

Speaking of video games, the gamers out there will love the device's screen. It's a 16-inch 2K resolution display (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) with a refresh rate of 240Hz. A high refresh rate enables smooth and responsive gameplay, making it a near necessity for fast-paced titles.

All this hardware does come with a power cost, however. While it's unplugged from a power source, the battery on the m16 R2 doesn't last very long despite all the tech meant to support its longevity. I performed my usual test of running an endlessly playing YouTube live stream at 720p and 50 percent brightness, and it lasted 6.5 hours with Best Power Efficient enabled.

ZDNET's buying advice

I recommend the Alienware m16 R2 to people who want a laptop that can do double duty. It excels at being an entertainment/gaming machine, but it's inconspicuous enough for the office. Prices for the laptop have risen in recent months. A build carrying an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, a GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card, and 16GB of RAM can be bought for $1,900 at Best Buy. A more powerful configuration with 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD is available for $2,479 at Amazon.

I should mention that you can customize certain parts of the device even after you've purchased it. For example, you can upgrade the SSD from 1 TB of storage to 8 TB. To learn how to do this, follow the instructions on pages 36 to 44 of the laptop's Owner's Manual, which you can find on Dell's website.",,"Cesar Cadenas, Staff Writer, Aug., At A.M.

ZDNET's key takeaways

Sometimes an AI can cause you or your company irreparable harm.

Sharing confidential data with an AI could have legal consequences.

Don't let an AI talk to customers without supervision.

A few weeks ago, I shared with you ""9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI - and why."" It's full of well-reasoned suggestions and recommendations for how to avoid having an AI produce code that could ruin your whole day.

Then, my editor and I got talking, and we realized the whole idea of ""when not to use an AI"" could apply to work in general. In this article, I present to you nine things you shouldn't use AI for while at work. This is far from a comprehensive list, but it should make you think.

Also: This one feature could make GPT-5 a true game changer (if OpenAI gets it right)

""Always keep in mind that AI isn't going to read you your Miranda Rights, wrap your personal information in legal protections like HIPAA, or hesitate to disclose your secrets,"" said LinkedIn Learning AI instructor Pam Baker, the bestselling author of ChatGPT For Dummies and Generative AI For Dummies.

""That goes double for work AI, which is monitored closely by your employer. Whatever you do or tell AI can and likely will be used against you at some point.""

To keep things interesting, read on to the end. There, I share some fun and terrifying stories about how using AI at work can go terribly, horribly, and amusingly wrong.

Without further ado, here are nine things you shouldn't do with AI at work.

1. Handling confidential or sensitive data

This is an easy one. Every time you give the AI some information, ask yourself how you would feel if it were posted to the company's public blog or wound up on the front page of your industry's trade journal.

Also: The best AI for coding in 2025 (and what not to use)

This concern also includes information that might be subject to disclosure regulations, such as HIPAA for health information or GDPR for personal data for folks operating in the EU.

Regardless of what the AI companies tell you, it's best to simply assume that everything you feed into an AI is now grist for the model-training mill. Anything you feed in could later wind up in a response to somebody's prompt, somewhere else.

2. Reviewing or writing contracts

Contracts are designed to be detailed and specific agreements on how two parties will interact. They are considered governing documents, which means that writing a bad contract is like writing bad code. Baaad things will happen.

Do not ask AIs for help with contracts. They will make errors and omissions. They will make stuff up. Worse, they will do so while sounding authoritative, so you're more likely to use their advice.

Also: You can use Google's Math Olympiad-winning Deep Think AI model now - for a price

Also, the terms of a contract are often governed by the contract. In other words, many contracts say that what's actually in the contract is confidential, and that if you share the particulars of your agreement with any outside party, there will be dire consequences. Sharing with an AI, as discussed above, is like publishing on the front page of a blog.

Let me be blunt. If you let an AI work on a contract and it makes a mistake, you (not it) will be paying the price for a long, long time.

3. Using an AI for legal advice

You know the trope where what you share with your lawyer is protected information and can't be used against you? Yeah, your friendly neighborhood AI is not your lawyer.

As reported in Futurism, OpenAI CEO (and ChatGPT's principal cheerleader) Sam Altman told podcaster Theo Von that there is no legal confidentiality when using ChatGPT for your legal concerns.

Also: Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman thinks you shouldn't trust AI for therapy

Earlier, I discussed how AI companies might use your data for training and embed that data in prompt responses. However, Altman took this assertion up a notch. He suggested OpenAI is obligated to share your conversations with ChatGPT if they are subpoenaed by a court.

Jessee Bundy, a Knoxville-based attorney, amplified Altman's statement in a tweet: ""There's no legal privilege when you use ChatGPT. So if you're pasting in contracts, asking legal questions, or asking it for strategy, you're not getting legal advice. You're generating discoverable evidence. No attorney/client privilege. No confidentiality. No ethical duty. No one to protect you.""

She summed up her observations with a particularly damning statement: ""It might feel private, safe, and convenient. But lawyers are bound to protect you. ChatGPT isn't, and can be used against you.""

4. Using an AI for health or financial advice

While we're on the topic of guidance, let's hit two other categories where highly trained, licensed, and regulated professionals are available to provide advice: healthcare and finance.

Look, it's probably fine to ask ChatGPT to explain a medical or financial concept to you as if you were a five-year-old. But when it comes time to ask for real advice that you plan on considering as you make major decisions, just don't.

Let's step away from the liability risk issues and focus on common sense. First, if you're using something like ChatGPT for real advice, you have to know what to ask. If you're not trained in these professions, you might not know.

Also: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out

Second, ChatGPT and other chatbots can be spectacularly, overwhelmingly, and almost unbelievably wrong. They misconstrue questions, fabricate answers, conflate concepts, and generally provide questionable advice.

Ask yourself, are you willing to bet your life or your financial future on something that a people-pleasing robot made up because it thought that's what you wanted to hear?

5. Presenting AI-generated work as your own

When you ask a chatbot to write something for you, do you claim it as your own? Some folks have told me that because they wrote the prompts, the resulting output is a result of their creativity.

Also: I found 5 AI content detectors that can correctly identify AI text 100% of the time

Yeah? Not so much. Webster's defines ""plagiarize"" as ""to steal and pass off (the ideas or words of another) as one's own,"" and to ""use (another's production) without crediting the source."" The dictionary also defines plagiarize as ""to commit literary theft: present as new and original an idea or product derived from an existing source.""

Does that not sound like what a chatbot does? It sure does ""present as new and original an idea…derived from an existing source."" Chatbots are trained on existing sources. They then parrot back those sources after adding a bit of spin.

Let's be clear. Using an AI and saying its output is yours could cost you your job.

6. Talking to customers without monitoring the chatter

The other day, I had a technical question about my Synology server. I filed a support ticket after hours. A bit later, I got an email response from a self-identified support AI. The cool thing was that the answer was complete and just what I needed, so I didn't have to escalate my ticket to a human helper.

Also: Is AI overhyped or underhyped? 6 tips to separate fact from fiction

But not all AI interactions with customers go that well. Even a year and a half later, I'm still chuckling about the Chevy dealer chatbot that offered a $55,000 Chevy Tahoe truck to a customer for a buck.

It's perfectly fine to provide a trained chatbot as one support option to customers. But don't assume it's always going to be right. Ensure customers have the option to talk with a human. And monitor the AI-enabled process. Otherwise, you could be giving away $1 trucks, too.

7. Making final hiring and firing solutions

According to a survey by resume-making app Resume Builder, a majority of managers are using AI ""to determine raises (78%), promotions (77%), layoffs (66%), and even terminations (64%).""

""Why are you firing me?""

""It's not my fault. The AI made me do it.""

Yeah, that. Worse, apparently at least 20% of managers, most of whom haven't been trained in the rights and wrongs of AI usage, are using AIs to make final employment decisions without even bothering to oversee the AI.

Also: Open-source skills can save your career when AI comes knocking

But here's the rub. Jobs are often governed by labor laws. Despite the current anti-DEI push coming from Washington, bias can still lead to discrimination lawsuits. Even if you haven't technically done anything wrong, defending against a lawsuit can be expensive.

If you cause your company to be on the receiving end of a lawsuit because you couldn't be bothered to be human enough to double-check why your AI was canning Janice in accounting, you'll be the next one being handed a pink slip. Don't do it. Just say no.

8. Responding to journalists or media inquiries

I'm going to tell you a little secret. Journalists and writers do not exist solely to promote your company. We'd like to help, certainly. It feels good knowing we're helping folks grow their businesses. But, and you'll need to sit down for this news, there are other companies.

We are also busy. I get thousands of emails every day. Hundreds of them are about the newest and by far most innovative AI company ever. Many of those pitches are AI-generated because the PR folks couldn't be bothered to take the time to focus their pitch. Some of them are so bad that I can't even tell what the PRs are trying to hawk.

But then, there's the other side. Sometimes, I'll reach out to a company, willing to use my most valuable resource -- time -- on their behalf. When I get back a response that's AI-driven, I'll either move on to the next company (or mock them on social media).

Also: 5 entry-level tech jobs AI is already augmenting, according to Amazon

Some of those AI-driven answers are really, really inappropriate. However, because the AI is representing the company instead of, you know, maybe a thinking human, an opportunity is lost.

Keep in mind that I don't like publishing things that will cost someone their job. But other writers are not necessarily similarly inclined. A properly run business will not only use a human to respond to the press, but will also limit the humans allowed to represent the company to those properly experienced in what to say.

Or go ahead and cut corners. I always need fun fodder for my Facebook feed.

9. Using AI for coding without a backup

Earlier, I wrote ""9 programming tasks you shouldn't hand off to AI,"" which detailed programming tasks you should avoid passing along to an AI. I've long been nervous about ceding too much responsibility to an AI, and quite concerned about managing codebase maintenance.

But I didn't really understand how far stupid could go when it came to delegating coding responsibility to the AI. I mean, yes, I know AIs can be stupid. And I sure know humans can be stupid. But when AIs and humans work in tandem to advance the cause of their stupidity together, the results can be truly awe-inspiring.

In ""Bad vibes: How an AI agent coded its way to disaster,"" my ZDNET colleague Steven Vaughan-Nichols wrote about a developer who happily vibe-coded himself to an almost-complete piece of software. First, the AI hard-coded lies about how unit tests performed. Then the AI deleted his entire codebase.

It's not necessarily wrong to use AI to help you code. But if you're using a tool that can't be backed up, or you don't bother to back up your code first, you're simply doing your best to earn a digital Darwin award.

Bonus: Other examples of what not to do

Here's a lightning round of boneheaded moves using AI. They're just too good (and by good, I mean bad) not to recount:

Letting a chatbot manage job applicant data: Remember how we told you not to use an AI for hiring and firing? McDonald's uses a chatbot to screen applicants. Apparently, the chatbot exposed millions of applicants' personal information

Remember how we told you not to use an AI for hiring and firing? McDonald's uses a chatbot to screen applicants.

The Suggesting terminated employees turn to a chatbot for comfort: An Xbox producer (yes, that's Microsoft) suggested

What about you? Have you seen an AI go off the rails at work? Have you ever been tempted to delegate a task to a chatbot that, in hindsight, probably needed a human touch? Do you trust AI to handle sensitive data, communicate with customers, or make decisions that affect people's lives? Where do you draw the line in your work? Let us know in the comments below.

A couple of months ago I popped the SIM out of my Galaxy S25 Ultra and spent a few weeks with the rugged Galaxy XCover7. To go along with that durable phone, Samsung just released the Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro tablet, and I've been hiking, kayaking, and exploring with it for the past few weeks.

Also: The best rugged tablets you can buy: Expert tested

The Tab Active5 Pro improves upon the Active4 Pro in a few areas requested by regular users, including stereo speakers, expanded RAM with an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor, and significantly improved battery capacity with dual hot-swap capability.

As a trade-off, the rear camera resolution has been decreased from 13MP to 12MP, but it's still perfectly capable of capturing documents and images while out in the field.

With 10,100 mAh of battery capacity contained in two user-replaceable cells, the Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro is built to serve its role continuously. You can even leave one battery in the device and keep it running while you swap the other out. If you don't have any other charged batteries, the tablet will work in no-battery mode if it is connected to a power source, which is a great solution for in-vehicle use in the field.

In order to test the Tab Active5 Pro in the field, I took it on a fishing trip to a high mountain lake in Washington State. It turns out there was no longer a trail to the lake, so I navigated through the overgrown forest down extremely steep terrain to the pristine lake.

I did not intend to test the tablet's rugged durability since those kinds of extreme tests are not allowed with loaners, but the conditions present during my trek resulted in some hard falls, water immersion, and real-life field testing of the tablet. It survived unscathed and was a joy to use.

As a professional naval architect, I survey ships and work in shipyards, with electronic drawings guiding me. The rugged Tab Active devices have worked well for my teams and me in the past in shipyards in Florida and Washington.

Over the past couple of weeks, the large spike S Pen has worked flawlessly for navigating around and marking up drawings. I especially appreciate the secure storage silo in the protective case. The larger diameter of the S Pen made it easy to use with gloves on, and the display can be manipulated in glove mode.

Three physical buttons on the bottom of the tablet, in landscape orientation, make it easy to unlock and navigate the user interface. A lime green button on the top, identified as the active button, can be customized with actions for press and press/hold actions.

In addition, the side button above the volume buttons can be set up with double-press and long-press actions, so there are plenty of options for accessing your favorite apps and utilities through physical button actions, as anyone with experience working in the field will appreciate.

Matthew Miller/ZDNET

The display is not as vibrant as I am used to with AMOLED phones and watches, but it worked well for the outside conditions where I was using the tablet. The long battery life was more important for keeping me powered up while navigating the remote wilderness and if you are looking for a rugged tablet for field work then the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active5 Pro is definitely a tablet to consider.

ZDNET's buying advice

If you're looking for a tablet to use outside the office or in conditions where it'll be subjected to the elements, you should consider a rugged tablet made for those use cases.

It's compact enough to fit in an average pocket, and is perfectly compact for carry-on or tote bags. It's also equipped with overcharge and short circuit protection, so you can confidently charge your favorite devices (up to 5) in one go. There's also a 2-year warranty if you purchase from Statik, so if you're on the fence about a travel charger, there's some reassurance.

Also: My favorite 3-in-1 travel MagSafe charger is smaller than a cookie

The MagSafe pad has a 15W design, perfect for charging phones and earbuds. The built-in USB-C cable offers 15W, and the Lightning cable offers 12W. Despite its brick-esque design, it isn't as heavy as I anticipated it to be, and I love that the carrying loop makes it easy to clip this charger to my tote bag. As a Gen-Z woman in tech, I do wish Statik offered some fun color options like Anker and TwelveSouth often do, but I also can't be too judgmental about fairly priced, no-fuss tech.

And for someone who didn't have a multicharger with interchangeable adapters for globe-trotting, this is a great investment in my travel tech collection.

Also: This organizer pouch is the life-simplifying tech accessory I didn't know I needed

When I tested this charger from Statik, I was pretty impressed. The design is impeccably thoughtful, as it comes with plugs, cables, and more, so you can charger multiple devices in multiple ways. I was able to charge my iPhone and AirPods Pro 2 at the same time via the charging pad and lightning cable, using Statik as a power bank. I could also pop it into a plug if I need to boost the battery pack itself and add more devices to charge.

My only complaints with this travel charger are that I wish the built-in cables were longer and perhaps even retractable, like the USB-C cable in the Baseus Nomos 5-in-1 charging station, and I wish there was a dedicated Apple Watch charger.

These two upgrades would make this option truly unbeatable for me, but it's still a highly functional product, especially if you're not getting paid to overanalyze products like me. Plus, at $70, the price is great, especially since popular chargers like Anker's 3-in-1 MagSafe charger sell for $110, and it doesn't offer built-in plugs or cables.

ZDNET's buying advice

If you're a frequent traveler, the Statik 5-in-1 charger is a great option to have on hand, especially if you vacation around the world. Thanks to its multiple adapter options, it's also a functional option for frequent business travelers or those on the go.

But if you already own other 3-in-1 MagSafe chargers or similar multi-chargers, it may not be worth purchasing another unless you're specifically looking for built-in plugs or interchangeable adapters for other countries.",,"Kayla Solino, Aug., At A.M.

My kid had been asking for a Toniebox for two years, but I always talked her out of it. I'm no Grinch, but each set basic starter kit is $100. Then we finally got one during a Prime Day sales event. Testing a Toniebox has not only convinced me that it's perfect for my kids and worth every penny, but it's such a great device that I'd recommend it to any parent of young children. Here's why.

Also: I ditched my Bluetooth speakers for this slick turntable - and it's more practical than I thought

The Toniebox is a portable audio player covered in a padded, soft fabric that makes it easy for kids to handle. It's light enough for my three-year-old to carry and kid-friendly enough for my five-year-old to navigate. It's a fantastic and interactive way for kids to enjoy screen-free entertainment without access to questionable content.

Each Toniebox uses small, colorful figures called Tonies, available in various popular characters. Each Tonie figurine represents a different track list with audio recordings, which can be music and a story or either one, like a modern-day CD or cassette. Unlike a CD, the tracklists are triggered by a built-in NFC chip within each Tonie figurine.

My kids love Disney princesses, so they got that Toniebox starter bundle. This bundle includes four princesses, a Playtime Puppy Tonie with nursery rhymes, a charging dock, and a pink Toniebox for $180, though it often goes on sale.

Also: Skip the iPad: This tablet is redefining what a kids' tablet can do

When the kids want to hear music from Cinderella, they place the Cinderella figure on the Toniebox, and the music starts playing. If they want to skip to the story, they tap the right side of the Toniebox, and the Cinderella story begins playing. When they're tired of Cinderella and decide to switch to Moana, they can replace the Cinderella Tonie with the Moana one, and the music will immediately start playing.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

Tilting the Toniebox to one side or the other triggers fast-forward and rewind. The volume controls are at the top of the Toniebox, in the form of two cat ears that kids pinch to turn the volume up or down.

A simple Amazon search for Tonie will result in dozens of characters that make great birthday gifts and stocking stuffers, like Minnie Mouse, Blippi, Trolls, and the new Ms Rachel Tonie. There's also plenty of additional bundles to check out, like the Disney Princess Toniebox starter set (pictured above). However, users can also buy Creative Tonies, a blank slate for which parents can add up to 90 minutes of content using the Tonie app. This content can include recordings, so they can even add stories read by a grandparent or family member.

Why I recommend this product

Our Toniebox is so beloved that my kids listen to at least one story each night as they fall asleep -- they cycle through each princess and have added a couple of Tonies to the collection, including a Creative Tonie and a Joy Tonie with both Inside Out and Inside Out 2 stories (each 30 minutes long). Now, the box has its own stand and carrier in their room.

The Toniebox connects to the Tonie app on a smartphone, as the content is initially downloaded from the internet. Once downloaded, the content is stored locally on the device and used offline. Kids can take the wireless Toniebox around the house or when visiting family or camping to enjoy songs and stories with up to seven hours of battery life.

I've spent plenty of time testing headphones and earbuds, and I've found a handful of small, seemingly obvious but mighty tips to keep them in tip-top shape and performance. If your headphones or earbuds aren't working like they were in their heyday, these small fixes might help.

Also: 4 headphones I swear by (and how I use each pair differently)

These tips can also help you develop healthy maintenance habits if you recently purchased a new pair of headphones or earbuds to replace your daily drivers.

1. Replace your earpads (and tips)

Your headphones' earpads and earbuds' eartips are more important than you think. When they're in their best shape, they maintain optimal sound quality, noise isolation, and comfort. It's normal for them to degrade over time from typical wear and tear, and once you notice tears, rips, or excessive shape distortion, it's time to replace them.

Many popular headphone manufacturers, like Bose, Sony, and Apple, sell OEM replacement pads and tips, which are typically the easiest part of the headphone to self-repair. You can find cheaper third-party replacements, but you may get what you pay for. Buying OEM replacements ensures the same quality and fit, even though they may be more expensive.

2. Put your headphones in their case

Jada Jones/ZDNET

You might keep your headphones out of their case for convenience, but storing them in their case when not in use keeps them safe from exposure to dust, debris, and humidity. Your headphones have plenty of small openings, particularly the holes on the earcups that house microphones and the charging port.

Also: Why these headphones are still the best from Bose - even though they're a year old

Most over-ear headphones haven't been formally tested for dust or water ingress, and although they can handle some exposure, it's best to keep them as protected as possible. Keeping them in their case protects them from dust, dirt, moisture, and scrapes, scratches, and bumps, promoting longevity.

3. Your headphones deserve proper charging hygiene

You may be familiar with battery hygiene regarding your smartphone, and similar rules apply to the rechargeable battery inside your headphones. The biggest difference is that the battery inside your headphones is much smaller and weaker than your smartphone battery, and excessive battery drain is common in older headphones.

Also: 3 charging mistakes that are killing your tablet - and the simple fix you need

Your headphones likely have a one-year manufacturer's warranty, and battery issues tend to occur once it's expired. Replacing the battery yourself is possible, but it may require some soldering. To preserve your headphones' battery, try to keep it between 10% and 80% charged, and don't leave them plugged in overnight. After 45 minutes to an hour on the charging cable, your headphones should be good to go.

4. Clean your headphones

Cleaning your headphones and earbuds is not only good for your devices, but for your ears, too. In-ear earbuds can accumulate earwax, and excessive wax on the speaker can degrade audio quality and impact ear health.

Also: When was the last time you cleaned your headphones? Here's how and why you should

The pads of your over-ear headphones can collect oils, sweat, hair, and skincare products, leaving residue and absorbing odors over time. Keeping your earpads clean can preserve their condition and help avoid skin irritation.

5. Updating firmware and software

Jada Jones/ZDNET

It's easy to ignore software and firmware update requests, but like any device, they can significantly improve your headphones' performance. Headphone and earbud firmware updates can enhance your devices' power on/off or hibernation performance, noise cancellation abilities, wireless connection reliability, or battery endurance.

ZDNET's key takeaways

Recent rumors and leaks suggest that the Pixel 10 series will feature magnet-based Qi2 wireless charging.

That would position the Google Pixel well above Samsung, Motorola, and OnePlus in charging capabilities.

The big question is how fast the charging will be, and how reliable it is compared to the iPhone's MagSafe.

Get more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.

There's been no shortage of Pixel 10 leaks leading up to its expected August launch event -- even Google has taken part in it.

While early renders and marketing imagery point to a family of phones that look nearly identical (if not the same) as the last generation, the biggest feature upgrade with the Pixel 10 series may actually be hidden in plain sight.

Qi2 certification

I'm talking about Qi2 certification, the wireless charging standard introduced at CES more than two years ago that has yet to gain widespread market adoption due to material costs, lack of user demand, and other reasons, according to brands. At the time of writing, only recent iPhone and Samsung models and the HMD Skyline are considered Qi2‑ready. That's it.

Also: The next big wireless charging leap is coming soon: What Qi2 25W means for Android phones

If the latest rumors are true, the Pixel 10 series next week will join that list, while also surpassing the likes of Samsung for one key reason: magnets.

Based on a a recent leak by Evan Blass, it appears the Pixel 10 will support magnet-based accessories without a special case or adhesive adapter. Theoretically, you'd be able to attach existing MagSafe products to the Pixel 10 without worrying that they'll slip off.

Notably, the leak shows a product render of the base model Pixel 10, with its rumored aquamarine finish and additional camera sensor on the rear. With the Pro models expected to feature the same capabilities (and more), it can be assumed that the Pixel 10 Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold will also receive a Qi2 upgrade.

Why is this a big deal?

See, the big pull when Qi2 was introduced wasn't necessarily the faster wireless charging rate, but the concept of magnetic accessories -- think MagSafe for Android phones.

Also: Google just teased its new flagship phone early - here's what we've gathered

By encouraging phone makers to embed a magnetic adapter within the devices, users can seamlessly snap on portable chargers, tripods, and other tools. It also promotes a more optimal and direct charging experience when docking a phone on a charging pad.

The Wireless Power Consortium later revealed that in-body magnets weren't required for Qi2 qualification. As a result, phone manufacturers are relying on cases with magnets to handle the physics, rather than incorporating them into the phones themselves.

While the attempts to circumvent the lack of in-body magnetic adapters are admirable, Google has the perfect opportunity to correct the situation and truly open up an accessory ecosystem that rivals the iPhone.

ZDNET has reached out to Google to get more details on the matter and will report back with any new information.

When ChatGPT first launched over two years ago, the AI chatbot was met with such high demand that OpenAI introduced a premium plan called ChatGPT Plus. This plan guaranteed access to the chatbot even during blackout periods. ChatGPT Plus perks also included access to OpenAI's most advanced models, making the $20 plan almost a no-brainer for superusers. However, as OpenAI's offerings have evolved over the past couple of years, so have its plans.

Also: How ChatGPT could replace the internet as we know it

If you consider yourself an AI power user or are looking to get the most out of your AI usage, you're likely wondering which ChatGPT tier you should try. In this guide, we'll help you decide whether a free plan, ChatGPT Plus, or a $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro subscription is the best fit for you.

(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)

You should use ChatGPT Plus if...

ChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month. You're probably asking yourself: Why pay when you can use it for free? There are five main advantages, but the TL;DR is that the free tier has heavy usage limits, and the Plus tier gets you the latest features and models first.

If you only use ChatGPT now and then for fun, it's not worth subscribing. But if you use it for work, writing, creating images, using it as a search engine, or you find yourself opening the app all day, every day, then subscribing is likely a good idea.

Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET

1. You want access to legacy models

When OpenAI launched GPT-5, the company had it replace all of its legacy models in ChatGPT. The model is meant to combine the best of OpenAI's offerings with a smart model for most queries and a deeper reasoning model for harder problems. However, many paying subscribers were upset because they preferred the prior models for their workflows that were already in place.

Also: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)

Sam Altman even acknowledged in an X post that ""suddenly deprecating old models that users depended on in their workflows was a mistake."" As a result, OpenAI brought back the option for ChatGPT Plus users to access legacy models, including: GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-4.1-mini, in addition to GPT-5 (Auto, Fast, Thinking mini, and Thinking).

2. You want to access GPT-5's different modes

While GPT-5 combines the best of a deep reasoning model (GPT-5 thinking) and a standard smart model for a balance of speed and quality, users with a Plus subscription can also manually toggle between GPT-5 Thinking, GPT-5 Thinking Mini, and GPT-5 Fast.

Also: GPT-5 bombed my coding tests, but redeemed itself with code analysis

The benefit: Users can choose to use a reasoning model when they think it would be the best fit instead of having the real router feature automatically understand which model to use based on the conversation, the complexity of the prompt, and more, which is still available with the GPT-5 Auto option. If you often work on harder problems that require the model to think more to output the best possible answer, then having the option to toggle on GPT-5 Thinking could be a compelling reason to subscribe.

3. You want to access Sora

OpenAI's Sora video-generating model allows users to create stunning, realistic videos from text prompts or their own assets with up to 1080p resolution. Videos can be up to 20 seconds long, with a limit of 10 seconds for ChatGPT Plus users, and can be widescreen, vertical, or square aspect ratios. Whether you have a real workflow reason for AI-generated content or just want to tinker, it is a fun model to use.

To create images, ChatGPT also uses the GPT-4o image generator, OpenAI's most capable image generator to date.

With it, you can simply ask ""create an image of…,"" describe a scene, and receive an AI-generated image that can include realistic human generations and even text. You can also upload an existing image and describe edits for GPT-4o to apply -- like adding text, refining details, or changing backgrounds. Just be aware that complex requests may take a couple of minutes.

Also: ChatGPT's new image generator shattered my expectations - and now it's free to try

Usage is capped for free users, but Plus and Pro subscribers can enjoy much higher daily quotas.

OpenAI said free-tier users can use GPT-4o only a limited number of times within a five-hour window. It will notify you once you've reached the limit and invite you to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus. If you're on the Free tier and rely heavily on image creation, you might see a message like: ""You've reached your image creation limit. Upgrade to ChatGPT Plus or try again tomorrow...""

So, if you often use AI for visual assets, such as videos or images, ChatGPT Plus is an easy choice.

4. You want to use the Codex AI coding agent

OpenAI recently integrated its powerful Codex AI coding agent into ChatGPT Plus, so now anyone with the $20-a-month Plus can get AI-powered coding suggestions without shelling out $200. You can point it at your GitHub repo, and it'll whip up code changes, run checks to make sure nothing's broken, and even handle installing dependencies online if you let it. Just keep in mind it doesn't ""remember"" anything between sessions, so you have to give it clear instructions every time.

Also: You can use OpenAI's super powerful AI coding agent Codex for just $20 now

Also, since the coding agent is new to ChatGPT, you might encounter some speed bumps if many people are using it at once.

5. You want expanded access to ChatGPT's best features

You're probably noticing a theme here: The majority of ChatGPT's most advanced features are eventually made available to free users, but with heavy usage limitations. Therefore, the main benefit of upgrading is getting to use features like Deep Research, Advanced Voice Mode, and GPT-4o image generation a lot more frequently than you could on the free tier. Subscribing to ChatGPT Plus also gives you priority access to OpenAI's latest models and newest tools well before they reach the free tier.

With a Plus account, you can access extended limits on:

messaging

file uploads

image creation

data analysis

Deep Research

Agent Mode

GPT-4 image generation

memory and context

If you don't want to miss out on the latest ChatGPT features and models, you should subscribe to the Plus tier.

You should use ChatGPT Pro if...

OK, so now that we've discussed why Plus is worth it, let's look at the more expensive Pro plan that costs $200 a month. Most people would never pay a car payment's worth of money to use AI, but there are special instances in which it could be worth it.

Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET

1. You want what ChatGPT Plus has on a greater scale

All ChatGPT Plus perks and features are included in ChatGPT Pro, but with far fewer usage constraints. Pro also adds several exclusive capabilities. Here's a rundown of the biggest benefits, should you be seriously considering the upgrade.

Unlimited access to all reasoning models: This includes GPT-5 with pro reasoning, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1 (and its mini variant), o3, o3-pro, o4-mini, and GPT-4.5 (research preview).

As you can see, Pro offers more features and higher limits than the Plus tier. Pro users reportedly rarely encounter any constraints and can truly leverage the full power of ChatGPT and its newest tools.

2. You want access to OpenAI's most powerful models

As mentioned in the No. 1 selling point of ChatGPT Plus, there are many perks to being able to access the older models, including sticking to what you were already using in your workflow and what you are accustomed to. In addition to all of the legacy models accessible in the Plus tier, with the Pro subscription, you can also access GPT-5 Pro, the most capable version of the model aimed toward complex tasks, and the Thinking 4.5 (research previews), which is only available to Pro users because ""it costs a lot of GPUs,"" according to Altman.

You should use free ChatGPT if...

Finally, let's look at the free version of ChatGPT. I discussed most of its features above, so in this section, I'll break down what advantages it can offer over the paid plans. It essentially comes down to how often you use ChatGPT and whether having access to the latest and greatest features matters to you. If you don't use it much and don't care, the free version is 100% the way to go.

Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET

1. You don't want to pay a monthly fee

The free subscription now offers many competitive AI features, reducing the need for a Plus subscription, especially for tools that were once paywalled. Free ChatGPT users can access:

GPT-5

ChatGPT Search (web browsing for timely information and sources)

Image Generation via GPT-4o (daily limit applies)

Deep Research (up to five ""lightweight"" tasks per month)

ChatGPT Voice (free monthly preview)

File and Photo Uploads for in-chat discussions (limited usage)

Memory Feature for referencing recent conversations (lightweight version)

If you only need occasional AI assistance -- and do not mind daily usage caps -- the free tier should serve you well. It's surprisingly robust and now includes many advanced features that were once behind a paywall. For instance, when OpenAI launched GPT-5, it also became available for free users.

2. You're a casual ChatGPT user

If you rarely hit the daily usage limits for text, voice, or image generation, upgrading to Plus or Pro might not be necessary.

Also: ChatGPT can record, transcribe, and analyze your meetings now

The free version offers enough headroom for light interactions -- asking a few questions per day, generating a handful of images, briefly exploring advanced data analysis, and more. However, if you often see messages about hitting your limits (for text, voice, images, etc.), it might be time to consider paying for a subscription. For superusers who need top-tier capacity and extended access to advanced features, there's ChatGPT Pro, but Plus is a more affordable middle ground.

Ultimately, if your needs are minimal and limitations don't bother you, sticking with the free tier is perfectly fine.

FAQs How much do ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro cost? As of August 2025, here are the ChatGPT Free, Plus, and Pro pricing tiers and how they differ, as displayed by OpenAI on its website: Screenshot by Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET Does the Pro tier include everything you get with Plus? Yes, Pro contains everything in Plus. That means unlimited or higher limits on certain features and exclusive access to GPT-5 Pro and Research preview of new features. Do ChatGPT Pro users experience downtime or blackout periods? Pro subscribers have the highest priority for uptime, making downtime extremely rare. However, no tier can guarantee 100% uptime if OpenAI undergoes major outages or scheduled maintenance. If you upgrade to Plus, can you later switch to Pro? You can upgrade from Plus to Pro at any time through your account settings. Your billing date may adjust based on when you switch. How to get early access to new ChatGPT features on the free tier Unfortunately, free users typically must wait until OpenAI rolls them out publicly.

ZDNET's key takeaways

The Premier League is working with Adobe to exploit generative AI.

Explorations show customers want to create, not just consume content.

Long-term hyper-personalization goals should be approached carefully.

The English Premier League football season starts this weekend. With 1.8 billion people watching the competition in 900 million homes across 189 countries (streaming on Peacock), it would seem there's limited scope for emerging technology to boost supporter engagement. However, Alexandra Willis, director of digital media at the Premier League, has other ideas.

Willis told ZDNET that while UK-based supporters are the lifeblood of the Premier League, new supporters around the globe have varied demands and requirements. She said the organization's digital transformation strategy focuses on finding ways to serve all football fans.

Also: What is digital transformation? Everything you need to know about how technology is changing business

As part of this process, the Premier League uses Adobe technology to create AI-powered digital experiences for supporters worldwide. With the Adobe Experience Platform and the tech firm's AI agents and applications, Willis and her team are consolidating fan preferences and using this data to develop new experiences.

""The Adobe Experience Platform is giving our team something powerful,"" she said. ""We're going to learn together and work out how we can use the technology to benefit our overall strategy. It's an exciting opportunity because we can do a lot more in the service of our fans.""

The Adobe technology suite is the Premier League's first customer data platform. Other business leaders have told ZDNET that solid digital foundations are crucial for any business that wants to engage with customers in an age of AI, and that's also the situation at the Premier League.

Also: How AI-enabled autonomous business will change the way you work forever

Willis said a new website and app are crucial elements of the Premier League's digital platform strategy. The organization uses Adobe's analytics technology to gain an in-depth understanding of fan preferences across digital channels and its AI models to deliver personalized experiences.

The Premier League also uses Adobe's AI-powered features, including Generate Video and Clip Maker, to help supporters create content from text-based prompts, and Adobe Firefly, which allows fans to generate content within the organization's fantasy football game.

""To be able to develop our digital transformation strategy and then have it come to life, and for it to become real with the launch of the new app and a new website, and to be able to deliver new experiences, is something we're proud of,"" said Willis.

Using AI to boost Fantasy Premier League

The start of the English football season marks the beginning of a popular off-field activity: fantasy football. With over 11 million players, Fantasy Premier League (FPL) is the world's biggest and most popular fantasy football game. Willis and her team are eager to use AI to refine the FPL experience.

That process has already begun. This season, FPL managers can use Adobe's Firefly gen AI technology to create personalized badges and kits for their teams in Adobe Express.

Also: How AI amplifies these other tech trends that matter most to business in 2025

""Enabling FPL managers to create assets to show off their team and how they're doing is one aspect of how we're using AI on the creativity side of the business,"" she said.

Alexandra Willis: ""People want to be able to participate in content creation."" Premier League

Willis said these AI-enabled developments point the way to the future of fan engagement. In an age of gen AI, customers want to create content, not just receive marketing collateral.

""It's about allowing supporters to utilize Premier League content and imagery, and share the things equally they're excited about, and using Express to sort of remix those things and to put their personal touch on them,"" she said.

Willis is keen to see what content fans will create and suggested that AI is helping to power new ways of engaging with tech-savvy supporters.

""It will be interesting to see how people behave and how they use the tools,"" she said. ""This initiative is a demonstration of the fact that people want to be able to participate in content creation.""

Of course, data security and governance are key considerations as the Premier League continues to explore gen AI.

Crucially, given the organization's nascent forays into fan-designed content in FPL, Adobe Firefly is designed to be commercially safe. The technology is trained on a dataset of licensed content, such as Adobe Stock.

""That feature is incredibly important for us,"" said Willis. ""In general, ensuring that what we're doing is credible and trusted and safe is fundamental, and we've put a lot of effort into delivering on that promise.""

Evolving and adapting customer personalization

Willis said it's early days for AI-enabled experiences, both generally and within her organization. She said it's important to walk before you run.

""We're not trying to do too much at the beginning,"" she said. ""We have this passionate fan base. We have around 50 million people in our database, and we want to take the time to discover what they want from us.""

While other business leaders have told ZDNET about the importance of using emerging technology to hone in on the finer details of customer requirements, Willis suggested it's also important to reflect and refine your approach carefully.

""Rather than leaping into hyper-personalization right from the very beginning, our strategy is about following the customer's lead and learning from them the things that they want to follow and want to pay attention to, and then seeing how they then behave and react,"" she said.

""I'm sure some fans might say, 'I'm never going to pay attention to what a certain player does,' and then, suddenly, something that player does is different, they contribute to the supporter's FPL team's performance, and then that fan goes down a rabbit hole of learning more about the individual player. Those are the types of things that we want to learn from and evolve and adapt to as we go.""

Willis has refined her leadership approach to digital transformation during her career. Formerly a journalist, she worked for Wimbledon for over a decade, becoming communications and marketing director in August 2021. In September 2022, she moved to the Premier League. She said smart digital leaders are focused on outcomes.

""Success is about being able to apply the strategic vision of a business and its objectives and to utilize the tools and capabilities that technology provides,"" she said.

""That process includes working with other colleagues to understand and identify how technology contributes to broader business models. You need to go beyond the narrow field of technology into genuinely delivering against business strategy.""",,"Mark Samuels, Senior Contributor, Aug., At P.M.

Soundbars are gaining in popularity because of their sleek design and ability to provide an ample boost in audio quality compared to built-in TV speakers. Even with their plug-and-play nature, you can make a few modifications to help unleash the best possible sound quality.

Also: I replaced my Sonos Arc Ultra with this Samsung flagship soundbar - and it's a worthy alternative

Whether you're new to soundbar setups or a self-proclaimed audiophile, familiarizing yourself with some key settings can elevate your viewing and listening experience. Read on for five pointers on how to optimize your soundbar's performance.

1. Placement and acoustics

It may sound obvious (because it is), but where you place your soundbar is a major factor. For the most balanced sound, position the soundbar directly below your TV, centered and parallel to the screen. Mounting a soundbar above your screen is also an option, but the ideal height placement for ultimate clarity is at or near ear level. Make sure your soundbar isn't obstructed by furniture or even decorative items that can block sound waves.

Also: I changed 3 settings on my PS5 to significantly improve the performance

Each room has unique acoustics. Does your room have high ceilings or large windows? Are your floors hardwood or tile? If so, consider adding soft furnishings such as rugs and curtains to reduce reflections. You could also take it a step further by adding acoustic panels or diffusers to your area. Acoustic panels or diffusers can help manage sound reflections and create a more balanced audio environment.

As noted by ZDNET contributor Artie Beaty, advanced soundbars like LG's S95TR go through a tuning process specific to the layout of your viewing area by using an AI room calibration feature. If your soundbar lacks such a feature, do some experimenting to find the sweet spot.

Remember that most soundbars are designed to project sound directly toward the audience, so make sure the device is angled for optimal sound dispersion across all seating positions. Moving the soundbar a foot or so from your listening area or adjusting the angle just a few inches can noticeably improve or degrade the output.

2. Subwoofer location means everything

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

If your soundbar has a subwoofer, place it on the floor, preferably in a corner or along a wall, to enhance bass response. The aim is to create a seamless blend between low-frequency effects and the rest of the audio spectrum.

I've read about a music producer who would do a ""crawling test"" to pinpoint the best location. This involves playing some bass-heavy content and literally crawling around the room to find the spot with the most balanced bass output. Voila -- there's the best place to put your subwoofer.

Also: What is spatial audio? Here's everything you need to know

Some soundbars come with a built-in subwoofer, and others allow you to connect an external subwoofer wirelessly or via a wired connection. (More on this later.)

In the absence of a subwoofer, and if it's in your budget, consider adding a unit like the SVS SB-1000 Pro. A more affordable option is the Klipsch Reference R-120SW. Hooking up a subwoofer can significantly enhance your audio experience with deeper, more impactful low-frequency effects, making you feel like you're part of the onscreen action.

3. Customizing your soundbar's equalizer and audio settings

As I mentioned earlier, some soundbars feature automatic calibration systems that use a microphone to measure and adjust sound settings for your specific room. Many more of them come with various audio presets or EQ settings that you can adjust according to your tastes. Certain soundbars offer the flexibility to tailor audio settings for individual inputs, allowing you to fine-tune the sound quality based on whether you're watching shows, listening to music, or gaming.

In any case, adjusting bass, treble, and other parameters can greatly improve audio quality based on your room's acoustics and your listening habits. Also, make sure to experiment with any advanced features, such as Virtual Surround Sound, Dialogue Enhancement, or Bass Boost, if available.

Also: I spent hours demoing Samsung's newest soundbar, and this one feature separates it from the bunch

Increasing the bass can add depth and power to action scenes, making explosions and other intense moments more dramatic and engaging. Raising the dialogue levels puts a focus on the center channel and midfrequencies, making vocals more distinct and easier to comprehend -- so you can actually understand what Yennefer of Vengerberg is whispering in The Witcher.

Along those lines, check to see if your soundbar has a volume leveler. This feature (which can be turned on and off) lets you listen to content with greater consistency. You'll be reaching for the volume button on your remote much less frequently with volume leveling.

4. Check your (HDMI) connection

Michael Gariffo/ZDNET

Your soundbar is likely connected to your TV via an HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel) or eARC (enhanced Audio Return Channel) port. This technology supports advanced 3D audio formats such as Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, and Sony 360 Reality Audio for a super-immersive surround-sound experience.

Ideally, your soundbar will support HDMI-CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) connectivity, which lets you command devices connected through HDMI by using only one remote control. In this scenario, you can use your TV's remote to control the soundbar and, for instance, an added Blu-ray player.

Also: What is EQ and why is it an important factor in improving sound?

Integrating the operation of multiple devices into one is certainly my preference. Who wants three separate remotes sitting on their coffee table? Having all your devices plugged into the soundbar reduces clutter and avoids having to install a switch box. You can then easily switch between audio sources by changing the soundbar's input mode using your single remote.

OK, this doesn't pertain to maximizing audio quality, but here's something that does. Compared with connecting your soundbar via Bluetooth, a wired connection remains the best method for transferring sound. Opting for a wired connection, such as HDMI or optical cables, guarantees a stable and lossless audio transmission.

This allows the audio content to be heard as it was intended, without any degradation or disruptions caused by wireless signal interference or compression. Also, keep in mind that not all cables are created equal. Be sure to use a cable that supports high-res formats and has a higher bandwidth that can process more channels to support extra bass and tweeter speakers.

5. Updates are essential

This one is short and sweet: check for software and firmware updates! (This, by the way, is essential for any device.) Manufacturers often release updates that can improve your soundbar's performance and add new features. Regularly installing updates ensures your soundbar benefits from the latest enhancements and fixes, and squashes bugs that can corrupt sound quality.

With these simple tips, you can maximize your soundbar's performance and enjoy a richer, more immersive audio experience. Proper placement, room acoustics optimization, and thoughtfully adjusting your settings will surely elevate your listening experience for streaming. Whether you're watching action-packed blockbusters or rocking out to your favorite tunes, your soundbar will be ready to deliver exceptional audio quality.

Your AirPods can be your best friend, small enough to stay in your pocket or bag until you need them. But if you like to work out with your AirPods, pushing your slippery earbuds back into your ear can become a particularly intense workout. I've found three products to help with this problem -- a few dollars spent can revitalize your AirPods experience.

Unfortunately, some people's ear anatomy simply isn't compatible with certain earbuds, and the best option may be purchasing from another brand. But if you're determined to make your AirPods stay in your ear, try these tips first.

1. Detachable ear hooks

Jada Jones/ZDNET

If you like to run or weightlift, the impact of your feet hitting the ground or the explosiveness of specific compound movements can shift your AirPods in your ears. Earbuds with ear hooks, like the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2, provide the in-ear stability to keep them in your ear for your entire workout.

If you don't want to buy another pair of earbuds, you can purchase detachable ear hooks to attach to your AirPods. I tried the Icarerspace hooks from Amazon. You get two pairs of hooks for $16, and this product has 4/5 stars out of 1,591 reviews.

Also: Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. AirPods Pro 2: Which earbuds are best for working out?

These ear hooks are compatible with AirPods Pro and all base model AirPods. I tested them on my AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4. The ear hooks clip onto the AirPods' stem, and then you can rock and roll.

The stems offer more in-ear stability for dynamic movements like running, biking, walking, and exercises that require bending over or lying on a bench, like bench presses or push-ups. I found that I didn't have to adjust my AirPods in between sets.

These stems aren't as comfortable or high-quality as the stems on the Powerbeats Pro 2, and after a few hours, they began to irritate the back of my ear. I'm generally not a fan of ear hooks; even the better quality ones irritate my ears.

2. Silicone wings

Jada Jones/ZDNET

Silicone wings or grips are an option if you don't want plastic ear hooks to go around your ears. I tried the Proof Labs silicone wings from Amazon. For $16, you get four pairs in different sizes, a storage pouch, and a carabiner for portability. You can buy them for AirPods Pro 1 and 2, and AirPods 4. Out of 22,100 ratings, this product has 4.3/5 stars.

These wings cover the AirPods' bud and sit at the top of your concha, or the top part of the ear's thick cartilage fold. The Proof Labs wings eliminated the extra space in my ear for my AirPods to wiggle around, offering stability and comfort.

I found the wing tips helpful when working out, but they also helped my AirPods Pro 2 create a better seal in my ear. During a long car ride, I forgot my beloved Sonos Ace and had to resort to my AirPods. The improved fit and seal in my ear made for maximized audio and noise cancellation performance.

If you find that too much external noise reaches your ears due to loose AirPods, these silicone wings could help. Like the detachable ear hooks, these silicone tips must be removed before placing your AirPods back in their charging case.

3. Ear tip replacements

If you want to try an option that doesn't need to be removed to put your AirPods back in their charging case, the Azla Crystal silicone ear tip replacements are ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner's product of choice.

Also: I've used my AirPods Pro 2 since their 2022 release. Are they still worth it in 2025?

These ear tip replacements are fairly priced, coming in at two pairs of tips for $15 (at the time of writing). They're only compatible with AirPods Pro models and received 4.1/5 stars out of 1,248 reviews. Thanks to their less slick surface, users say these tips provide a more stable fit than the original AirPods Pro tips.

FAQs Why do my AirPods keep falling out? The main culprit of loose, ill-fitting AirPods is your ear anatomy. Everyone's ear shape is different, and some are better suited for AirPods than others. For the non-Pro model AirPods, if your concha bowl is too small, they may fall out. If your antihelix ridge (the piece of cartilage that sticks out into the concha bowl) is too flat, it may not be able to hold and secure your AirPods in your ear. The AirPods Pro 2 use silicone tips to stay in your ear, but those are highly dependent on your ear canal depth and width. If your outer canal is too shallow or narrow, your AirPods may not seal properly in your ear, leading to poor audio, noise cancellation, and fit. Accessories like the ones in this article can help, but if they don't, your best bet may be to try another brand with different earbud shapes or consider over-ear headphones instead.

There is little debate that AI will revolutionize working practices, but there is less agreement about the best way to exploit this transformation.

While 90% of CIOs are piloting AI or investing in small or large-scale developments, over two-thirds (67%) haven't seen measurable ROI, according to the recently released Nash Squared/Harvey Nash Digital Leadership Report.

""Leaders know the technology, but they're struggling with its application in the business to create value,"" Nash Squared CIO Ankur Anand told ZDNET during a conversation about the key points emerging from the leadership survey.

So, how can business leaders overcome this struggle? Four business leaders provide their best-practice tips for using AI to solve big business problems.

1. Create a top 10 list

Joe Depa, EY's global chief innovation officer, said your use cases should align with your highest-value business priorities.

He told ZDNET that this alignment must be a continual work in progress. Business leaders should keep refreshing their approach to focus on the areas that matter.

""I often use a top 10 list, just to keep it simple,"" he said. ""Here are the top 10 use cases that we'll focus on. Anything more than 10 and there's a danger people lose interest.""

Depa said reviewing priorities for the top 10 list with other senior executives requires a firm, strategic hand.

""If people want to add things, I'll say, 'What will we take off the list?' Because when you add something to the list, you've got to take something off,"" he said. ""That approach helps keep people focused. Once you have that regular cadence, updated and refreshed, people can start thinking about applying AI to use cases.""

Depa said this careful strategy helps businesses avoid spending money on AI solutions that don't hit their ROI metrics.

""It's usually when you don't have a clear use case or business value attached, but you have a cool problem that you want to solve. Those are the ones that you have to say, 'Hold on a second. I know that's a cool problem, but what's the business case?'"" he said.

""That's where you can get in a bit of a rut if you go down a path of just trying to solve some problems with AI, without having a clear business case for its application.""

2. Run hackathon sessions

Adobe CIO Cindy Stoddard said her IT team has used AI in many areas and works with the rest of the business to identify other use cases.

Her team used AI to explore past IT requirements and create recommendations so business analysts and product managers know what will likely be required when users demand a new service.

Also: Is your business AI-ready? 5 ways to avoid falling behind

The IT team also used AI in testing to create scripts that can be reused to automate repetitive processes.

For new use cases, the team runs hackathons that help surface applications for emerging technology within IT and across the business.

""People submit different ideas about what they think could change,"" she told ZDNET. ""We encourage everyone to submit areas for improvement around what they see at the ground level.""

Stoddard's team then works with business peers and external partners to select the best projects.

""People who submit ideas put together teams. We'll also bring in some of our key vendor partners to help train staff on the technologies,"" she said. ""Then we'll go through a development and judging process to see if the ideas deliver value. Many of the ideas we deliver end up in our production systems.""

3. Learn through failure

Caroline Carruthers, CEO at consultant Carruthers and Jackson, told ZDNET about five ways to prepare an organization for an AI transformation.

However, she also mentioned something crucial to identifying the right use cases -- embracing innovation.

Carruthers said there's lots of emerging technology to test, from large language models to causal AI.

""You don't know how this tech will fit in your organization. Waiting until things are perfect with AI won't work,"" she said. ""You need to experiment. You need to carve off a little safe sandbox, something you can start and play with to understand how your organization can get the best from AI.""

Also: 5 ways to manage your team more effectively in the AI-enabled enterprise

Like other business leaders, Carruthers said it's important that the projects you support focus on the right areas. That targeting can mean learning by failure, as long as it's not too expensive.

""If you're genuinely going to experiment with AI, then you almost need to get into celebrating failure,"" she said. ""Conducting an experiment and finding out the experiment didn't work, but learning something new, is a valid use of an organization's time. Just don't spend a lot of money doing it.""

Carruthers said every AI initiative should be part of a larger project to overcome big organizational challenges.

""Innovation is about making AI part of the business, but it's doing it small, iteratively, and safely. When we talk about experiments, and especially when we talk about data, because it can solve some of the world's biggest problems, our brains tend to go, 'Oh, look at all the stuff we can do,'"" she said.

""But if we try to tackle that problem, it's big, unwieldy, and we'll get bored, and we won't deliver things in time. Whereas, if you solve a small problem, it's like, 'Oh, that's nice,' and then you solve other problems.""

4. Educate your employees

Tobias Sammereyer, team lead for performance engineering at XXXLutz, said many people are lulled into a false sense of security, thinking that easy-to-use tools like ChatGPT can be applied to any business case.

""We need to educate our guys how to use AI stuff properly, and how to be precise with their prompts to get what they want,"" he said.

Sammereyer told ZDNET that business and digital leaders must help their people understand AI's benefits and limitations before they apply the technology to use cases.

""Try to tell them what's possible, but also what's not possible, because there are two kinds of people -- one thinks AI is just hype and the other believes they can do anything with it. And both are incorrect.""

Also: AI agents aren't just assistants: How they're changing the future of work today

Sammereyer said the key to success is finding the middle ground.

""Educate people, and then you can use AI, especially with generative AI,"" he said. ""Just be aware that AI can make mistakes in the same way that a human being can make mistakes. Double check the results, and then you're good to go.""

He said this process relies on your AI systems being fed enough reliable data.

""AI is like a people pleaser. The tools want to give you a good answer -- if it's correct or not, that's up to you to double-check,"" he said. ""So, you need to be critical in your thinking and see if the AI system has enough data and is equipped to give you the right answer. Just remember that it will give you an answer, but not necessarily the correct one.""

ZDNET's takeaways

Gemini Live now works with Calendar, Maps, Keep, and Tasks.

Update is rolling out to most Android and iOS users.

It can add events, guide routes, and manage lists or notes.

In May of this year, Google debuted Gemini Live with screen sharing and camera access for Android. Google has been slowly integrating the feature, which lets you ask Gemini about anything on your screen (or that you can see with your camera), into its suite of apps since June.

Gemini Live is getting a little more useful this week, as it's officially rolling out for Calendar, Keep, Maps, and Tasks apps.

Also: Gemini adds powerful new Deep Think model - what it does and who can try it

First noticed by 9to5Google, most users are now seeing Google's real-time AI voice assistant across new apps. You can tell if the update has hit your device by opening the Gemini app, tapping the Live button in the bottom right corner, and looking directly above the Live controls.

If you have the capability, you'll see small chips for the connected apps when Gemini Live is accessing them.

Gemini Live's new tricks

Calendar

With Calendar, you can check your events for the day, make a new event with your voice, and even use your camera to point at details (like date and time) to add that event to your calendar. I gave this a quick test with a flyer for a school event, and I was surprised at how easy it was.

Also: Have stock questions? Google Finance tests new AI chatbot

What really blew me away, though, was when I tried it with my alma mater's football schedule for the upcoming fall season. I asked Gemini to add all the home games since I'm a season ticket holder. The AI was able to discern which games were home games and add the events to my calendar, including time and opponent. Live even went down the list, recapping, ""I've added games against App State, Georgia, Army… to your Calendar.""

Maps

Gemini Live for Maps is useful for getting guidance to a certain spot, and it even works with other Google apps. I asked Live to ""guide me to the event that's on my calendar today"" (the same school event I added earlier), and it showed me the way. It didn't pull up Maps by itself, but it did create a link I could easily tap to get going.

Tasks

When it comes to Tasks, Gemini Live can show your saved lists. You could do this on your own easily by pulling up the Tasks app, but Live is an easier way to access your lists. I was able to add tasks to my list and see what was on my to-do list.

Keep

Similar to Tasks, Keep's integration with Google Live is simple but makes an existing capability a little easier to access. I was able to add notes to Keep.

The new capability is available on both the Android and iOS versions of Gemini Live.

I used to struggle when shopping for a new computer. Over time, I learned to narrow things down to what I call the ""performance trifecta"" -- three main components you should be mindful of when buying a laptop or desktop: processor, storage drive, and RAM. The first two are pretty easy to figure out. A good processor ensures that a computer performs well, and a lots of local storage means you'll have plenty of room for all your files.

Also: One of the best work laptops I've tested has MacBook written all over it (but it's even better)

Memory is a component I don't think many people fully understand or pay attention to (I was certainly a part of this group). RAM, or random access memory, is essentially a computer's short-term memory. Instead of saving data directly onto an SSD, the computer stores files temporarily in the RAM for quick access. That way, the device won't need to use its storage to open a document or software resources, ensuring fast performance.

There's a lot of information and differing opinions regarding RAM and how much you need on your computer. Should you opt for the laptop with the 32GB LPDDR5X RAM, or will 16GB be enough? I'm here to cut through all the fog and provide easy-to-understand advice on the amount of memory you should get.

How much RAM do you need in 2025?

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

The short answer: it depends on the operating system. For Windows machines, 16GB of RAM has become the operational minimum on new consumer laptops. Modern workloads have ramped up to such a degree that less RAM on a Windows device is fine, but it will limit you to everyday tasks like writing emails, internet browsing or watching YouTube videos.

But let's be real here: the average worker is probably running dozens of tabs in their browser, a handful of apps in the background, and (possibly) generative AI, all of which demand memory power. In that sense, most people using their Windows laptops for work will want at least 16GB (for a value-driven, future-proof option) for a smooth user experience.

Also: Why I highly recommend the M4 MacBook Air to most people (and now it's on sale)

When it comes to MacBooks, things are a little bit different. Because Apple's machines are so optimized to handle daily workflows, 8GB of RAM goes a bit further than a stock laptop running Windows. In fact, it wasn't until only recently that Apple made 16GB the starting point with the new MacBook Air M4.

MacBooks with 8GB are still solid machines for daily use, while more powerful models like the MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max offer substantial power with 24GB, 36GB, or more, making them some of the most powerful laptops on the market (and some of the priciest).

Besides just Windows and Macs, Chromebooks are a third category of consumer laptops that have seen a spike in popularity over the last few years due to their average lower price and lightweight operating system: ChromeOS.

Because ChromeOS is so streamlined, Chomebooks can get along just fine with 8GB or even less, making them great machines for handling the basics like working out of the browser and having your Google Suite at your fingertips with snappy performance and a low price. The trade-off, however, is that you'll have less access to apps you'd otherwise find on Windows.

Also: Is a refurbished MacBook viable in 2025? I did the math, and here's my expert advice

All in all, it's true to say that the more memory you have, the better your computer should perform. But having too much RAM can also be a poor return on investment because you end up spending money on a resource that you hardly ever use to its fullest extent. It's like owning a big house but only using a few of the rooms.

When buying a new laptop, I just recommend having a clear understanding of what you want to use it for -- that way you can make a realistic expectation about how much RAM you need.

What does DDR5 mean?

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

Sometimes, when shopping for a computer, you'll see the letters ""DDR"" followed by a number. This is an acronym that stands for ""double data rate."" Without getting too deep into the weeds, DDR is a type of technology that improves the data transfer speed from RAM to other components, such as the processor. There have been five main DDR generations so far, with the latest and fastest standard being DDR5.

Similar to 16GB of memory, DDR technology has effectively become the new standard for RAM as users demand faster speeds. There are also variations of the technology. A notable version is LPDDR5X, which stands for low-power double data rate 5X, a more energy-efficient version of DDR5 designed specifically for mobile devices.

Don't expect DDR6 RAM to be released for a computer near you anytime soon. We saw the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) announce the release of LPDDR6 back in early July. The JEDEC is the organization that established DDR as a standard for computers. The technology is available for manufacturers to implement in their devices, but whether or not it'll happen -- or how soon -- is yet to be seen.

When should you upgrade?

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

16GB is fine for most cases, although if you're a gamer or creative professional, you should consider opting for 32GB of RAM. More RAM will ensure that the games you play and the video-editing apps you use for work operate more smoothly. I have that amount for my personal computer, and I'm very happy with that setup because I don't just write.

I also play games on my desktop, edit photographs and videos, and run virtual machines, among other things. It's a heavy workload that requires the correct amount of resources to operate; even then, I am considering upgrading my PC to have more. It's not uncommon for me to see my workload take up over 70% of my computer's total RAM.

I consider anything above 32GB of memory excessive unless you're a specific type of user. If you're editing 8K videos or running heavy apps simultaneously, then you'll probably need 48GB or 64GB of RAM. A good laptop that can deliver would be something like the M4 MacBook Pro or the Dell Premium 16. These are solid, top-of-the-line machines capable of tackling tough workloads.

Why should you trust me? I've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I choose to make my main computer, as I want to ensure the devices I use can handle my day-to-day tasks. I'm on my computer all day, practically every day of the week. Also: I tested several AIO computers in 2025, and these are the best for your office setup I'm also at a point where I've tried just about every type of laptop on the market. I know which features and specs you should look out for when purchasing a new computer -- and which ones are not worth your time. The advice I have given is not a set of hard and fast rules. I just aim to provide a foundation of what you should look for in a laptop. What is best for you depends on your unique needs. Show more",,"Cesar Cadenas, Staff Writer, Aug., At A.M.

I remember when people used to scoff at refurbished tech. Buying a used phone or computer was like rolling the dice: you never knew exactly what you were getting.

Well, the times certainly have changed. And, in this economy, the prices on refurbished tech are looking more and more tempting. Consumers are challenging this idea that we're all supposed to buy brand new phones and laptops every few years, and in the process, the market for refurbished tech has blown up.

Also: Should you buy a refurbished iPad? I tried one from Back Market and here's my verdict

Having never purchased a refurbished product myself, I was very curious as to how the experience would go with a new (used) laptop. So, I connected with the folks at Back Market and acquired a $950 MacBook Pro M1 from 2021 to test out as my main driver for a few weeks.

I'll say right now: it wasn't a perfectly seamless experience, but buying brand new tech rarely is, either. Here's how it went, and what I've learned from the process.

How Back Market works

MacBook Pro M1 (14-inch) Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

First thing you should know is that the retailer offers different tiers of products: you can buy a MacBook in Fair, Good, Excellent, or Premium condition, with the prices scaling higher with better condition. If you're wondering what Fair condition looks like, it could include some visible signs of use, but ultimately, the internal parts have been inspected and verified by Back Market to be in good working order.

After choosing the level of wear you're comfortable with, you then go through and choose the processor, memory amount, storage, and color of your new MacBook -- just like you would a brand new one.

Also: Your MacBook is getting a major upgrade for free - 5 MacOS 26 features I'm trying right now

Lastly, you can choose to include a trade-in with another device as part of the purchase. This process consists of a Back Market rep appraising your device and giving you an offer in a dollar amount. You then have 21 days to ship the item to Back Market, and once they get it, they'll cut you a rebate check.

Can you trust a refurbished item?

MacBook Pro M4 (14-inch) Kerry Wan/ZDNET

I don't blame you for being wary of used tech. But keep in mind that Back Market only takes in products it knows it can resell, and even then, it has to pass a 25-point inspection test to ensure they're in good enough condition.

This testing, repair, and parts replacement process is what sets a refurbished MacBook apart from a used one you'd buy straight from the hands of someone on Facebook Marketplace, for example.

Besides a few signs of wear and tear (which you can realistically expect from a device in the Fair or Good categories), the primary thing to consider is the device's battery life. Luckily, you can see your MacBook's battery capacity in the settings, along with a host of other information, including how many cycles it's gone through.

Also: MacBook Pro vs. MacBook Air: How to decide which Apple laptop you should buy

The rule of thumb is to replace a battery that has dipped below 80% capacity, so a device purchased through Back Market should be above that mark, with Premium tier devices certified to be above 90%.

The MacBook Pro M1 I got from Back Market arrived in the Premium tier, so there was actually not a scratch or dent on the device at all. The screen looked flawless. The battery capacity was at 95%, and I had no issues with the keyboard or trackpad.

The only issue I experienced was that a day or two after I first set it up, it randomly booted up in recovery mode, prompting me to reinstall the latest OS. I did so, and it hasn't happened again since.

How much do you save?

Here's the big question. How much are you really saving? Let's break it down based on three different comparable MacBook Pros from different generations: the M1 Pro I got from 2021, the M2 from 2023, and the latest MacBook Pro on the market, the M4 from 2024:

CPU Memory/Storage Price MacBook Pro M1 14"" (Refurbished) M1 Pro 10-core 16GB, 1TB $958 MacBook Pro M2 14"" (New) M2 Pro 10-core 16GB, 1TB $1,579 MacBook Pro M4 14"" (New) M4 Pro 10-core 16GB, 1TB $1,799

The refurbished M1 is not available new from most retailers, but you can still get new M2s from Amazon. As you can see, it's significantly cheaper -- over $600 less -- than the next generation up with comparable hardware. The difference between the M2 and M4, however, is smaller; just a few hundred dollars.

If you're wondering how they compare, CPU benchmarking results from Geekbench put the M1 and M2 10-core CPUs quite close together, with the M4 understandably a bit further off. These numbers refer to the CPU's performance limits under a heavy load, showing that the newer MacBooks have more power under the hood on the top end.

But the differences are not earth-shattering, here. When it comes to everyday tasks like working out of a browser, running productivity software, and multitasking with different apps across the latest MacOS, the difference in performance is not as easy to identify.

And yes, the M1 MacBook Pro will be able to upgrade to the all-new MacOS 26 Tahoe when it comes out this fall, meaning it'll have the same operating system as newer MacBooks.

Geekbench Single-Core CPU Geekbench Multi-Core CPU MacBook Pro M1 14"" (Refurbished) 2,451 10,983 MacBook Pro M2 14"" (New) 2,648 12,310 MacBook Pro M4 14"" (New) 3,742 14,693

The final verdict

So, should you buy a refurbished MacBook? If you want to enjoy the latest features like iPhone mirroring, the new and improved spotlight, and the liquid glass UI redesign in MacOS 26 and don't need the top-of-the-line processing power, then absolutely, yes.

You can get a refurbished MacBook Pro M1 with 16GB of unified memory for $841 less than a MacBook Pro M4 with a 10-core CPU. If you're not editing 4K video, animation, or rendering large image files, a top-tier processor might be overkill.

That being said, by choosing a refurbished laptop, you'll want to carefully weigh the trade-offs. Make sure you're opting for enough local storage to future-proof your device, decide what kind of physical condition you're comfortable with, and make sure the device you choose has a healthy battery.

Lastly, keep in mind that Back Market is not the only place to purchase refurbished MacBooks, Apple has its own official refurbished store where you can purchase everything from MacBooks to iPads to Apple Watches.",,"Kyle Kucharski, Aug., At A.M.

I've been fairly vocal recently that Samsung's One UI 7 is my favorite Android skin. It is fast, responsive, and intuitive. But nothing comes fine-tuned to your experience straight out of the box. You need to personalize your smartphone to make it more appealing. I change almost a dozen settings on every Samsung Galaxy phone to best suit my needs, and I believe these will elevate your user experience, too.

Also: The best Samsung phones to buy

From setting the highest available screen resolution to more privacy-focused features, here are 10 Galaxy phone settings (plus a bonus) that I recommend changing to enhance your Galaxy phone experience. Please note that some settings might be phone-specific.

1. Turn off pop-up notifications

Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET

I do not like it when a message from a contact or an intrusive app notification pops up while I am in the middle of reading online or texting my favorite people. I get distracted easily. If a notification pops up, I tap on it and forget what I was doing.

Also: Everything announced at Samsung Unpacked this week: Z Fold 7, Watch 8 Classic, tri-fold phone, more

If you are anything like me, you should change this setting even before switching to gesture navigation. Go to Notifications > Notification pop-up style > Apps to show as brief > Toggle off All apps.

2. Switch to gesture navigation

Unless you are setting up your new Samsung Galaxy phone from an older model, it defaults to the older three-button navigation system. If you like it, that is fine. But I find Android's gesture navigation more intuitive -- everything is a swipe away instead of an on-screen button.

If you want that, you can change the system navigation to gestures by going to Settings > Display > Navigation bar > Swipe gestures.

3. Set to the highest screen resolution

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Samsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra has the best display on a smartphone right now. Thanks to second-generation Gorilla Armor, it is less reflective and displays colors better than its predecessor. You get a sharp QHD+ screen, but it is not set to that resolution by default.

You need to go to Settings > Display > Screen resolution to get the best available display experience. It will use more battery, but the Ultra is an efficient smartphone. Even after maxing out the screen resolution, I still get an all-day battery life.

4. Change the side key's function

Smartphones no longer have a ""power button."" It is called a side key or side button now, and it is one of my most disliked changes in recent times. Phone companies have renamed the power button to accommodate their smart assistants on long press.

Also: 5 preinstalled apps you should delete from your Samsung phone immediately

Google's Gemini is available by other methods, and Bixby is not as useful anyway, so I suggest changing the side key's function to offer a power menu. You can do so by going to Settings > Advanced features > Side button > Long Press > Power off menu.

5. Adjust lock screen notifications

Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET

One UI 7 has changed how notifications appear on your lock screen. It is set to show icons on the top left corner by default, which is a big change from the previous card view. I prefer apps to show notifications in the latter form. To change this, you can go to Settings > Notifications > Lock screen notifications > Cards.

I also hide sensitive notification content on the lock screen because I do not want anyone to walk up to my phone and see my personal messages. To change this setting, you can opt for Hide content under the same Lock screen notifications menu.

6. Sign in or sign up for a Samsung account

I juggle between different phones but keep coming back to Samsung phones for One UI. Having a Samsung account is a big part of the user experience on Galaxy phones. From Samsung Wallet to Samsung's own password manager, I have a lot of information saved in them.

Also: I've tested every Samsung Galaxy S25 model - and my favorite isn't the Ultra

Many might want to turn to Google Passwords for better cross-device functionality, but I still recommend signing up for a Samsung account to access Galaxy Themes (more on this below) and the Galaxy Store. It will also benefit you when you move from one Samsung phone to another with a seamless transfer.

7. Install this app

Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET

I recommend installing the Good Lock app from the Galaxy Store. It enables a slew of Samsung-exclusive features on your phone. I found the best use case for it when I was reviewing the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It features a module called Home Up that has a One Hand Operation+ function.

Also: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time

Since the new Samsung flagship is a big phone, I set up a swipe down from the right edge to access Quick Settings. You can do the same for six shortcuts within the Short swipe and Long swipe gestures, and access many more features within the Good Lock app.

8. Uninstall the bloatware

Samsung Galaxy phones come with many apps that you might not use. Unlike previous years, you can now uninstall or at least disable them to save memory. For example, I do not have a Samsung TV and do not want the Microsoft Copilot app on my phone, so I uninstall TV and CoPilot, respectively. Other apps I disable or uninstall include Facebook, Samsung Tutor, and OneDrive.

9. Customize the home screen

Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET

Samsung has some of the best widgets on a phone. I love the Calendar widget because I can adjust the transparency. As a result, it looks better and keeps the functionality intact without disturbing the layout of my home screen. I have it located on the top so everything is just a glance away, yet it never asks for attention -- unlike other opaque Calendar widgets.

Also: I bought Samsung's Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025, but I'd recommend this model instead

I also change my icon grid to the 5x5 layout to accommodate more icons on the bottom-most row. They are just a thumb tap away. Additionally, I apply my wallpaper color tones to the app icons for a more pleasing look. You can go to Wallpaper and style > Color palette and toggle it on to apply wallpaper colors to the whole system. It is not perfect, and some icons might still not be supported. However, it looks better than the basic colors.

10. Fix always-on display

You get efficient displays on Samsung phones -- make use of them and enable everything, including the Always On display. I like having the time, day, and date information right there on the screen, available at a quick glance. Samsung defaults it to the Tap to show setting, meaning you need to tap on the screen for information.

I recommend changing that to Always to make it more functional. Go to Settings > Lock screen and AOD > Always-on Display > Always. You can choose if you want to display the wallpaper or not -- I have set it to just display a black screen so it does not drain more battery.

Bonus. Revert changes to the Notification Panel

Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET

Samsung changed its notification panel design to an iOS-like drawer. A right swipe down gives you access to Quick Settings, whereas a swipe down from the left side of the screen gives you access to notifications. However, if you like the previous design better, you can change it.

I like having my notifications under Quick Settings, like the good old days. To revert this new design element, swipe down from the top right corner of the home screen > Pencil icon > Panel Settings > Together. You can also edit the top quick settings within this menu.

Also: Every Samsung Galaxy S25 model compared: Which phone should you buy?

A few other things I do on my Galaxy phones include changing the keyboard to Google Keyboard and sorting the home drawer icons in alphabetical order so it is easier to navigate. Samsung phones are some of the best on the market. While they do not promise over-the-top features, they are reliable and offer the most polished user interface with One UI. Just adjust these few settings, and you are all set. Enjoy your new Galaxy phone!

Insta360 this week announced its venturing into a new frontier: drones. Its new sub-brand Antigravity will focus entirely on camera-equipped drones, and today, it revealed its first product: the Antigravity A1, the world's first 360 drone that can record 360-degree videos at 8K resolution.

Also: Why I recommend this 8K pocket camera over traditional shooters - especially at this price

I recently had a chance to fly the pre-production model, and it was a lot of fun. I was surprised at how easy it was to fly and shoot -- you can just concentrate on directing the drone since it records everything around it at once, making it impossible to screw up a shot. Here's a breakdown of the news.

Behind the design

The Antigravity A1 is a small drone, weighing about 249 grams. This means it's small enough to where you won't need to obtain a flight license or register the drone with the Federal Aviation Administration to fly it. You can just take it out and instantly have fun with it.

Although I don't have exact dimensions, I did get a chance to hold a pre-production model, and can confirm that it's small enough to carry with one hand. Those turbines you see in the photo below can be folded for easier storage.

Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET

See the world in 360

The drone has four cameras in total: two facing forward, one on top, and one on the bottom. A live feed is sent from the device to the micro-OLED displays inside Antigravity's Vision goggles. You don't see the full 360-degree view all at once; you only see a portion. To see the entire feed, you'll have to physically turn your head. Antigravity states that through ""FreeMotion technology and responsive head tracking,"" you'll be able to look ""freely in any direction"".

Also: I fell in love with a $2,000 mirrorless camera that puts design and simplicity over everything else

No matter where you look: up, down, left, right, front, back, upside down -- all you'll see is high-resolution video. There aren't any blind spots, and no part of the drone blocks the view. Insta360 told me that Antigravity utilizes ""advanced image stitching"" software to make the drone invisible to the camera.

Intuitive controls

Instead of the traditional double-handed controller with two analog sticks, the A1 drone is operated via Antigravity's Grip controller, which is held in one hand. To make the device move, you press down on the rear trigger to move forward. To change direction, you'll have to bank the controller to the side. Doing so moves the white circle on the headset's screen, which is what the drone follows.

If the motion controls are too confusing, users have the option of using the scroll wheel. Above the wheel is the battery indicator, letting you know how much juice the drone has at any given moment. That big button does a couple of things depending on how you press it. A short press activates the emergency stop, while a long press initiates a ""Return to home"" function.

Antigravity states the A1 drone will launch sometime in January 2026, with more information, such as pricing, bundles, and regional availability coming closer to launch.

With 18 ports -- which include three Thunderbolt 4 ports, five USB-A inputs, and dual SD card readers -- it covers just about every connection I could ever need. The USB-A ports are notable because they provide data transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, allowing users to quickly move files between devices. Additionally, it has a power delivery of 98W, enough to charge both a laptop and a smartphone at the same time. I really appreciate the CalDigit TS4's size. It measures 4.46 x 1.65 x 5.55 inches and weighs about 1.4 pounds, so you can take it to the office. It can even output video signals to dual 4K displays simultaneously, helping future-proof your setup. Who it's for: CalDigit's docking station is perfect for power users with demanding tasks. If you routinely work with external drives or high-resolution displays, this device's versatility will save you from contact plugging and unplugging. It's compatible with Windows, macOS, and ChromeOS laptops. The TS4 even works with iPads. Who should look elsewhere: At nearly $400, the CalDigit TS4 is one of the most expensive options on this list, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone on a tight budget.

Show less View now at Kensington View now at Amazon Why we like it: When initially making this list, I was stuck between choosing the CalDigit TS4 and the Kensington SD5000T5. The former may have come out on top, but for certain people, the Kensington dock is the superior choice. It is one of the first docking stations ever to support the Thunderbolt 5 standard, and thus its USB-C ports perform significantly better than the more common Thunderbolt 4. The dock provides up to 140W of power delivery to quickly recharge devices, boasts blazing-fast data transfer speeds of up to 80 Gbps, and can support triple 4K display setups. I should mention that with the Bandwidth Boost feature, those transfer speeds can go as high as 120 Gbps. It turns any laptop setup into a full workstation. If you look at the attached image, you'll notice some ridges on the side of the dock. Those aren't for show; they increase the device's surface area and help keep it cool. Review: Kensington SD5000T5 EQ Thunderbolt 5 Triple 4K Docking Station Who it's for: The Kensington SD5000TS EQ Docking Station is a great device for hybrid professionals and power users who want next-gen connectivity. A data transfer speed of 80 Gbps is no joke. You can move a large movie file from computer to computer in almost no time at all. The best part is that it is compatible with both Windows and macOS. Who should look elsewhere: If the Kensington SD5000TS is so good, why did it not take the top spot? For one, it's big, measuring 8.89 x 3.82 x 1.57 inches.

Expensive Kensington SD5000T5 EQ Thunderbolt 5 Triple 4K Docking Station Best laptop docking station alternative Why we like it: When initially making this list, I was stuck between choosing the CalDigit TS4 and the Kensington SD5000T5. The former may have come out on top, but for certain people, the Kensington dock is the superior choice. It is one of the first docking stations ever to support the Thunderbolt 5 standard, and thus its USB-C ports perform significantly better than the more common Thunderbolt 4. The dock provides up to 140W of power delivery to quickly recharge devices, boasts blazing-fast data transfer speeds of up to 80 Gbps, and can support triple 4K display setups. I should mention that with the Bandwidth Boost feature, those transfer speeds can go as high as 120 Gbps. It turns any laptop setup into a full workstation. If you look at the attached image, you'll notice some ridges on the side of the dock. Those aren't for show; they increase the device's surface area and help keep it cool. Review: Kensington SD5000T5 EQ Thunderbolt 5 Triple 4K Docking Station Who it's for: The Kensington SD5000TS EQ Docking Station is a great device for hybrid professionals and power users who want next-gen connectivity. A data transfer speed of 80 Gbps is no joke. You can move a large movie file from computer to computer in almost no time at all. The best part is that it is compatible with both Windows and macOS. Who should look elsewhere: If the Kensington SD5000TS is so good, why did it not take the top spot? For one, it's big, measuring 8.89 x 3.82 x 1.57 inches. You can't put it on its side because it'll just fall over, and upright it will demand a large amount of desk space. Secondly, it is strict about which operating systems it supports.

First, it can send a video signal from your laptop to three displays in Quad HD resolution (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) simultaneously. Each one will run at a refresh rate of 60Hz and you have the option to send out a 4K resolution signal, but only to a dual-monitor setup. Secondly, it can provide 130W of power directly into your devices to quickly charge them. The device also has the ExpressCharge Boost feature, which, according to Dell, can fast charge your laptop from zero to 35% in about 20 minutes or up to 80% in about an hour. What's more, it houses a wide array of ports from twin DP inputs to three USB-A ports. A unique feature of the dock is its modular design. You can remove the end of the device and replace it with a supporting component. However, at the time of this writing, it appears Dell no longer sells these modules. Who it's for: I recommend the Dell Dock - WD19S to anyone running a multi-monitor setup who also needs fast charging and dependable connectivity. It's right at home in IT departments, too. Dell gave its dock a MAC Address pass-through and remote port disablement to keep important data safe. Who should look elsewhere: I would not recommend the Dell Dock - WD19S to MacBook owners because it does not support macOS - only Windows 10, Windows 11, Ubuntu 18.04, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Plus, the module design may feel like wasted potential, so you can't do anything with it anymore. Remember: the modules are no longer on sale.

Its flat design played a major role in my positive review. You'll notice the front of the dock is slanted--and for good reason. Placing a laptop on top of the rubber strip causes the computer to sit at an angle, which improves airflow beneath the machine, so hot air won't be trapped between your laptop and the table.

For example, you could plug in an SD card and a hard drive while still having enough room for an external monitor. Who should look elsewhere: The power cable on the back is non-removable, which can limit placement options if your laptop's USB-C is on the wrong side or out of reach. Although it delivers 100W of charging, the Belkin Station recharges personal computers more slowly than a laptop's own power adapter. This is because some of the energy is lost within the Pro Dock.

Factors to consider when choosing a laptop docking station: A laptop docking station can upgrade your workstation. Here's what to think about before you buy one: Connection type: This is the most important aspect to look for when shopping for a docking station. Most new laptops support USB Type-C connections, so you'll want a device that has the same type of ports. The same thing goes for older laptops. Those machines tend to support USB 3.0 meaning you will need a docking station with the same input. If you buy a station without the right support, video signal or data transferring will not work as well as it should.

If you buy a station without the right support, video signal or data transferring will not work as well as it should. Power: For a true one-cable connection, your dock needs to supply power to the laptop. Some cheaper options lack this, forcing people to use it solely for connecting peripherals. Others may require you to use your laptop's own charger to power them.

Others may require you to use your laptop's own charger to power them. Video output(s): Look closely at the specs for video connections. If you need to send a video signal to a single 1080p display using an HDMI cable, any old dock will work. Things get complicated if you need support for two or more 4K external displays. For that, you'll need a docking station with a DisplayPort connection or a more recent version of HDMI.

Ports: Note if the dock you're considering has enough external ports for your devices. Docking stations can have USB ports that are either Type A, Type C, or both.

How did we choose these laptop docking stations?



Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET

We considered device specifications, important features, price points, and more when choosing the best laptop docking stations. Our guides mostly consist of popular, well-reviewed options, although we did consider docking stations with unique functionality, like the Dell Dual Charge Dock. We tested some of the options ourselves and used them in our everyday lives. We also researched and recommended models based on user reviews, brand trust, and price points. Below is a list of the criteria we followed to make our decisions.

1. Connection types

Connections types are crucial because they determine how well the device can meet your needs in terms of functionality, performance, and compatibility. Having the right ports can greatly enhance your productivity, and looking for models that support modern standards is important.

CalDigit's TS4 has pretty much everything you could ever want on a docking station. It has Thunderbolt 4 ports that support Windows laptops, MacBooks, and Chromebooks. One of those Thunderbolt 4 ports can also be used to send a video signal from a computer to a monitor alongside the DisplayPort. You also have audio jacks, an ethernet input for a direct internet connection, and more. But quantity is sometimes just as important as quality. The Baseus 10-in-1 docking station, for example, lacks an audio jack but supports Thunderbolt 4, making it a good choice for people who want a compact device.

Options like the CalDigit and Baseus options are equally valid, so we looked for different kinds of docking stations rather than just one.

2. Power delivery

Power Delivery is an important feature. Many docking stations allow people to charge their laptops through USB-C or Thunderbolt ports, eliminating the need to carry a separate laptop charger. Since it's so crucial, we hunted down devices with the fastest charging speeds, such as the NewQ 16-in-1. We connected a low-battery laptop for the docking stations we had on hand and noted how quickly it recharged. Not every model supports such high speeds, but that's OK, because they have other considerations.

The CalDigit TS4 has a power delivery of 98W, which is still plenty fast, and its wide selection of ports makes up for the difference between it and the aforementioned NewQ station.

3. Data transfer speed

As the name suggests, data transfer speeds affect how fast you can move files from your laptop to another computer on a small network. Higher speeds come in handy when moving large files (think video, high-resolution images, or computer backups), but you don't have much time to spare. In our tests, we could transfer a 10 GB backup of a Google account between two computers in just a few seconds.

Kensington's SD5000T5 Thunderbolt 5 docking station is the best in this regard, as it can achieve transfer speeds of up to 80 Gbps. This level of performance is thanks to its support of the new Thunderbolt 5 standard, allowing it to leave the other models in the dust.

4. Display connectivity

Connecting your laptop to multiple external displays lets you enjoy a desktop-like setup. This is one of the most defining features of a laptop docking station, enabling the tech to differentiate itself from a basic USB hub. When compiling the list, we sought devices capable of outputting to multiple high-resolution monitors at a high refresh rate. We then tested these models by connecting a laptop to a pair of 4K screens. The best ones made it onto the list.

5. Price points

It would've been very easy to fill the entire list with large docking stations with 15 or more ports and fast power delivery speeds. But doing so would be a disservice to all the great low-cost models. Not everyone can afford $200 or $300 for a high-end docking station; a user might not even need something so robust. Budget-friendly models also tend to be smaller, making them easier to carry around. We even made sure the cheaper options supported the necessary standards one might want in these devices and were worth the price.

Latest news on laptop docking stations

Plugable's new Thunderbolt 4 dock offers dual-4K HDMI, 96W charging, and 13 ports for just under $200. It contains one Thunderbolt 4 port for a single 6K display on macOS or 8K 30Hz on a Windows device, four USB-A ports, and UHS-II SD and microSD card readers.

RayCue also recently launched a new TB5 dock for Apple desktops, which uses DisplayPort and HDMI 2.1 connectivity. It can be used in conjunction with up to two SSDs and uses Thunderbolt 5.

Razer's new Thunderbolt 5 dock was hotly anticipated, but now seems to be a disappointment to many users, who claimed it doesn't work with over two-thirds of Razer's gaming laptops.

FAQs on laptop docking stations Why are docking station so expensive? There are several reasons that explain why docking stations are expensive accessories. For starters, they have complex designs. You can think of them as mini-computers complete with circuit boards and chips -- minus a display and their own power source. The number of total ports as well as their supporting standards and materials used in their construction contribute to the final price. Show more Why won't my laptop recognize my docking station? Fixing a laptop's inability to recognize a docking station can be surprisingly difficult, because the problem can be caused by a lot of things. Perhaps the station you purchased is faulty or something in your setup, like one of the ports, is broken. Before you do asking for a refund, the first thing you should do is install the latest drivers and BIOS updates for both the laptop and the docking station. Beyond that, make sure the cables are properly secure. Try disconnecting and reconnecting said cables. Next, ensure the correct playback device has been selected. It's possible you didn't choose the right video or audio source, which may explain there may not be any visuals or sound coming through. Show more Does leaving your laptop plugged in overnight ruin the battery? Modern laptops won't be negatively impacted by being connected to a docking station for an extended time. Battery technology has gotten much better over the years. Plus, many stations don't offer power delivery, a feature where the device will send energy to a laptop's battery, charging it. However, some docking stations offer power delivery, and it is possible (although unlikely) that these devices can harm your battery. Continuous computer usage puts extra strain on a laptop's power source, which can negatively impact your computer's ability to hold a charge. For this reason, we recommend unplugging your docking station when it is not actively being used. This is a good practice to perform to ensure battery longevity. Show more

It's a gorgeous laptop that redefines portability for gaming machines.

However, the ultraportable form factor results in trade-offs when it comes to performance and upgradability. View now at Razer

The Blade 16 has been Razer's flagship gaming laptop for years, but the thinner, sleeker design on 2025's Blade 14 (the thinnest Blade model yet) gives nothing short of a stunning first impression.

The new model is 11% thinner and 11% lighter than its predecessor, weighing just 3.5 pounds and 0.6 inches thick, with a slick, matte black finish that looks and feels premium. The form challenges the brand's own aesthetic with a device that looks more like a Dell XPS 14 or MacBook Pro than a gaming laptop.

Also: Is the Razer Blade 16 finally an everyday laptop? Its new slimmed-down design says 'yes'

The physical build is certainly one of this laptop's best features. Despite its thin and light frame, it feels expressly durable, with minimal flexing or screen wobble. I also love the large rubber posts on the bottom of the device that keep it from sliding around and allow for more airflow.

By highlighting this new and improved form factor, Razer is taking aim at competing 14-inch gaming laptops, particularly the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, which reigns supreme as one of the best 14-inch gaming laptops out there (one of our favorites, as well).

There are a handful of differences between these two laptops, however, with the Blade 14 trading a little bit of that power for its svelte form factor, opening up a use case as a device that's equally capable on the Steam dashboard as it is in the office.

The 3K, 120Hz OLED display is gorgeous, going right up to the very edge with ultrathin bezels mere millimeters thick. Similarly, the trackpad is large (but not ridiculously so), going as far to the edges as it possibly can, exuding a precise, expertly crafted physical aesthetic.

Also: I answered the million-dollar question about buying laptops - here's the ultimate guide

There are trade-offs to this design, however. The thinner form means less robust cooling and limits hardware, which The Blade 14 opts for in exchange for the extra portability. You've got an AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor paired with Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture in the GeForce RTX 50 series, up to the 5070, and up to 32GB of soldered RAM.

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

Sure, it's not the powerful loadout you can get on a gaming laptop, but that isn't really the point here. Razer scaled things back with the Blade 14 for a capable machine that errs on the side of battery efficiency, rather than trying to strongarm performance with heavy hardware.

For example, the Blade 14 supports 100W of total graphics power, going up to 115W with Dynamic Boost on, so technically this laptop has more than enough power to support a higher-end GPU like the RTX 5080. However, Razer likely opted for the 5070 to reign in heat and power consumption.

To compare, the 14-inch Asus Zephyrus G14 has the 5080, and that thing gets hot. Even with the fans cranking (which are not quiet), the reality of gaming on a 14-inch means accounting for these factors, of which the Blade 14 mitigates with this hardware.

Also: Finally, an ultraportable Windows laptop I'd use at the office (even though it's for gamers)

Gaming performance while plugged in is fantastic, with smooth, lag-free visuals in ""Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered"", ""Diablo IV"", and ""Cyberpunk 2077"". The latter, at 3K resolution, pushes things to the top end, with an average right around 40 FPS and some light visual stuttering, but nothing that feels problematic. Swapping to a more manageable 1200p resolution drastically improved performance.

In terms of benchmarking, the Blade 14 holds its own against two powerful 16-inch gaming laptops we've tested this year, the MSI Stealth 16 AI, and the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i, but shows a slight dip in raw power to the hardware in those (much larger) systems.

The Blade 14 has nice I/O coverage, as well. You've got two USB4 Type-C ports with Display Port 2.1 and power delivery support on either side, two USB-A ports on either side, an HDMI port (on the right side), and a MicroSD card reader.

Also: The best laptops you can buy: Expert tested

On the left side, you also have the proprietary charging port for the 200W power brick. This is the most efficient form of power delivery, but it will charge via USB-C as long as you have the appropriate wattage. Just don't expect plugged-in performance if you're gaming on this with a 65W charger.

The RGB lighting effects on the keyboard don't disappoint, either. Razer does a great job at maximizing the intensity and punch of each individual key, with minimal light leakage from the corners of the keys for a dramatic effect.

If you like per-key customization, the keyboard here has all the effects you can ask for in the accompanying Razer Chroma app. If you want to dress things down with a more subtle, office-ready aesthetic, you can do that just as easily.

The keyboard itself feels nice, with silent activation unless you're really hammering away. However, I can see some gamers not being completely satisfied with the travel distance, as although it feels premium, it errs more toward a MacBook or business laptop than an explicit gaming board. Conversely, the speakers are alright. They're better than average, but a little lacking in bass or richness.

Also: I traded my business computer for a Lenovo Legion laptop for work, and didn't miss it

The Razer Synapse app acts as the device's dashboard for controlling everything from performance modes to overclocking to at-a-glance metrics like operating temps and CPU usage. However, the app itself feels a little unfinished, and it became unresponsive a few times during my testing. It's useful enough to manage settings, however.

Just note that when you're on battery, the laptop forces you into Balanced mode -- with no option to switch out of it. Obviously, this is the preferred setting for when you're untethered from the outlet, but eliminating the option for short sprints of performance on battery power isn't my favorite thing.

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

Hopping into Balanced mode goes a long way toward maximizing battery life, however. Turning the refresh rate down to 60Hz and reducing brightness to half resulted in a little over nine hours of runtime during our battery testing -- very good for a gaming laptop.

For sustained gaming on battery, you can expect two to three hours, which is more or less standard, although less demanding games will undoubtedly push that past that to four to five. The takeaway here is that the Blade 14 can stay alive in low-demand sessions or while idle much longer than most gaming laptops, which tend to be a lot thirstier.

ZDNET's buying advice

The Razer Blade 14 is a gaming laptop, but it's not limited to that use case. You can take it to the office or pack it in a travel bag just as easily as you can get those headshots in the latest top-tier gaming titles on Steam.

It's a gorgeous laptop, and it resonates with me personally as a ""mature"" gamer whose all-day gaming sessions are (mostly) a thing of the past, but still enjoys a regular portfolio of games to log into.

Also: I replaced my work PC with this Dell laptop, and it was one of my best decisions

I'd recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a capable gaming laptop, but who is not interested in a massive 16- or 18-inch behemoth. In that sense, the Blade 14 speaks to the consumer who is comfortable with the trade-offs discussed and appreciates the lightweight form factor.

The Blade 14 comes in several different configurations, with 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of soldered RAM and either the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 or 5070 GPU. The most high-end loadout retails regularly for $2,999, which isn't exactly cheap and requires commitment to its niche use case. However, right now, it's on sale for $2,599 -- a price that's a lot more palatable.",,"Kyle Kucharski, Aug., At A.M.

I've always had a mixed experience with motion sickness. I don't suffer from it on a plane or ship, thankfully. But put me in the back seat of a car, and I often get hit by a bad case of it, especially if the ride is twisty and turny.

Triggered by mixed signals across your eyes, inner ear, and brain, those feelings of dizziness and queasiness can be extremely uncomfortable. For anyone else who experiences motion sickness, you can turn to your iPhone for help.

Also: Installed iOS 18.6 on your iPhone? Change these 11 settings for the best experience

Introduced with iOS 18 is a helpful option called Vehicle Motion Cues. With this feature turned on, animated dots appear on the edges of the screen to help you better process changes in the movement of the car. Your goal is simply to use and navigate your phone normally.

With its built-in accelerometer, your iPhone will sense that you're traveling in a moving vehicle. When the car turns, the dots move in the opposite direction of the turn.

""Research shows that motion sickness is commonly caused by a sensory conflict between what a person sees and what they feel, which can prevent some users from comfortably using iPhone or iPad while riding in a moving vehicle,"" Apple said when it unveiled the feature in 2024.

""With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly.""

How to use Vehicle Motion Cues on the iPhone

Here's how I combat my motion sickness with my iPhone and how you can do the same. You can also use Vehicle Motion Cues on an iPad with iPadOS 18 or higher.

1. Update your iPhone or iPad First, make sure you're running iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 or higher. Head to Settings, select General, and then tap Software Update. Allow the latest version to download and install. Show more

Over a year ago, National Public Data (NPD), a search site for people, earned a place in privacy infamy for a security breach that revealed the personal data of 3 billion individuals (that's billion with a ""b""). Now, after disappearing, NPD is back.

As ZDNET sister publication PCMag reported, NPD is open for snooping again under a new owner, the rather mysterious-sounding Perfect Privacy LLC. This company has no relationship with the virtual private network (VPN) business Perfect Privacy VPN.

The new NPD is back to the same old business of letting people search for personal data on friends, relatives, your ex-wife, and anyone else. While the site states it's ""not a 'consumer reporting agency' as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA),"" and that you may not use ""any information from this site to make decisions about employment, credit, insurance, housing, or other purposes covered by the FCRA,"" nothing is stopping you from using the site's data to do just that.

After a brief review of the new NPD, I found that some of the data on the site was inaccurate or outdated. Other information, however, was spot-on. The site also appears to struggle with handling hyphenated names. That's a win for me.

Where does NPD get its information?

NPD says on its site: ""We collect the data you find on our people search engine from publicly available sources, including federal, state, and local government agencies, social media pages, property ownership databases, and other reliable platforms. After the data is in our hands, we verify and filter it to make sure it is indeed accurate and up-to-date.""

While NPD is far from the only site that offers gray, semi-legal services, I wouldn't trust it with my information.

How to remove your information from NPD

If, like me, you'd just as soon not have NPD know who you are, where you live, and all the rest, take the following steps:

Search your name on nationalpublicdata.com When you find your profile, click ""View Full Profile."" Copy its URL. Go to nationalpublicdata.com/optout.html Drop the URL into the ""Your Profile Link"" field and click ""Request Removal."" Enter an email address, and the site will send you an email requesting that you click to confirm deletion.

You'll need a separate email address for each profile you want to delete.

Also: How to remove your personal info from Google Search - it's quick and easy

The site appears to remove your data quickly. That said, if you opt out, I'd check again in a few days to make sure.

How to check for your data on people-searching sites

Mind you, dealing with NPD isn't enough to erase your personal information. When I checked for my data on people-searching sites using Optery, a personal data removal service, I found my information on no fewer than 81 sites.

Also: I found the easiest way to delete myself from the internet (and you shouldn't wait to use it, too)

This is especially so during the hot summer months, when any distraction from the heat is a necessity. When I go on longer runs, I need earbuds that can not only tolerate my copious sweat, but also not constantly remind me that I have something on my ears.

Because of the amount of sweat I produce when running, I can't wear traditional earbuds (I've destroyed at least a dozen pairs), which means I have to use either bone-conducting headphones or open-air earbuds.

Also: These $15 accessories turned my AirPods into the most versatile earbuds I've worn

For the longest time, I used bone-conducting headphones, but I always found the sound they produce to be less than ideal. About a year or so ago, I started using open-air earbuds and a clip-on style. Since then, I've not had to deal with my sweat-destroying earbuds, poor sound, or discomfort.

I've also tried and reviewed several different pairs, each of which had its pros and cons.

When I received the OpenRock S2 open-air earbuds, I could have been skeptical because I had never heard of the brand. However, I've learned that earbuds have come a very long way since their early days, so even unknown brands or inexpensive pairs can catch me by surprise.

So, I went into this review without any preconceived notions.

My experience

As is with pairing most earbuds with Android, it was only a matter of unboxing the OpenRock S2s, opening he case, pulling out the earbuds, removing the protective plastic, putting the earbuds back, and then waiting for Android to find them, which took all of twenty seconds.

Once paired, I slipped the earbuds over my ears and immediately realized how comfortable they were. It's not just the shape and design but also the weight that makes them so comfortable. These earbuds weigh only 7 grams each, so you'll barely notice them.

Do I have earbuds on or not? I can't tell. Jack Wallen/ZDNET

Then came the important part of the test - the music. I started out with Messuggah's ""Ligature Marks,"" which was unfair of me because any song by that monstrous band can challenge the integrity of lower and mid-range earbuds and headphones.

Instead of continuing with that band, I switched to Primus and ""My Name Is Mud."" Much better. Les Claypool's bass was present but not overwhelming, Ler's guitar sounded more refined than I thought it would (given the price), and Herb's drums were nice and tight.

After ""Mud,"" I switched to my favorite test album, ""Signals,"" by Rush. This is where the OpenRock S2 earbuds didn't exactly shine, but didn't diminish all that much. While I found the midrange was spot on, the low end lacked some definition and the highs weren't exactly crisp. That's not to say the sound was bad. It's not.

Also: I recommend these budget earbuds over pricier Bose and Sony models - here's why

The S2 earbuds make up for the lack of bottom and top with a fairly decent soundstage, so the instruments aren't glommed together such that they become indistinct. If you know Rush, then you know there's always a lot going on with their music, and the S2 earbuds didn't muddy things to the point where it sounded more like a wall of sound than a trio of the best musicians to have ever graced rock's stage.

And although the low end wasn't exactly dynamic and refined, Geddy's bass was still very clear and agile. If you like your music more on the thumping side of things, these earbuds will disappoint. If your tastes tend to veer more toward's accurate bass notes, the S2 earbuds will not let you down.

Also: These $60 wireless earbuds made me question my audio spending habits

The important thing to remember here is that open-air earbuds are simply not capable of producing the punchy depths as traditional ""in-ear"" earbuds. I'm willing to make that trade-off to avoid destroying yet another pair with my evil, Xenomorphic sweat.

ZDNET's buying advice

If you're active and are looking for a pair of earbuds you can wear all day (or at least during longer activities), the Openrock S2 open-air earbuds will not disappoint. Are these the best $99 earbuds I've ever tested? No. But they are probably the most comfortable, and no matter how active I get, they stay in place. That last factor alone makes them worth buying, especially if your activities of choice involve a lot of movement.

One last thing about the S2 earbuds. These don't have a touch surface for pausing, skipping, repeating, or repeating songs (or answering calls.

There are physical buttons at the end of the earbud (the part that sits behind your ears), which do make it a bit more challenging to interact with when you're (literally) on the run. It takes some getting used to, but after about fifteen minutes pounding the pavement, I got the hang of it.

I remember when smartphones started using the built-in flash as a flashlight -- it was quite revolutionary. While the flash is good enough for many situations, there are times when its power output capacity is somewhat limited, and something bigger would be welcomed.

Also: The best rugged phones you can buy

Enter the Blackview BV7300 -- a ruggedized smartphone with the biggest flashlight I've seen on a phone.

Let's talk hardware

The BV7300 features a 6.67-inch HD+ IPS display running at 720 by 1,604 resolution and a variable refresh rate that shifts between 60Hz and 90Hz depending on the content on the screen. To add extra ruggedness, the display is armored with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for impact and scratch resistance.

It's a passable screen, with just enough color and contrast to vividly depict apps and text, but it looks a little washed out under direct sunlight. A boost in brightness (nits) would help the phone a lot.

Powering the smartphone is a 2GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio G81 chip backed by 6GB of RAM (with the ability to add a further 12GB using memory expansion, which I recommend doing), 256GB storage, and the ability to bump that up even further with a 2TB microSD card.

The BV7300 is big, thick, and weighs over two pounds! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Inside, there's a 15,000mAh battery (for comparison, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 4,685mAh battery) that can power the unit for 57 days on standby, up to 56 hours of call time, 28 hours of web browsing, and about 16 hours of video playback. Given the size of the battery, the smartphone supports fast charging up to 45W with the appropriate charger, making charging less of a headache.

Audio output is handled by a pair of 1712 box speakers that are nice and loud and have quite a decent range for a smartphone in this price range.

Also, I've never seen an Android phone that does everything that this one can (including night vision)

That's a very powerful battery, but it does add to the size and weight of the BV7300 -- it measures 8.15 x 8.11 x 1.46 inches and weighs a shade over two pounds!

And how can I forget that giant twin COB (Chip-on-Board) flashlight on the back with a combined 800 LED modules? One panel is a warm light, the other cold, and they can be turned on independently or together to offer a maximum of 800 lumens for up to 5.8 hours on a full charge.

The light is quite impressive! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

The contents are housed in a rugged, water- and dust-resistant polymer-armored package rated IP68/IP69K and MIL-STD-810H. This is a tough unit that can handle most drops, tumbles, and unexpected encounters.

The BV7300 boasts an impressive array of cameras, including a 50-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL JN1 Quad Bayer main camera, a 20MP SONY IMX376 night vision, and a 32-megapixel front-facing camera. The night vision camera uses built-in infrared illuminators to flood the area with light that's invisible to the eye but picked up by the camera.

Also: This $400 Motorola has no business being this good (and it comes with a stylus)

From the shots I gathered, don't expect this phone to blow your mind. Notably, the two sensors exhibit a noticeable lack of detail and color inaccuracy, but not to the degree that portrays your subject in a totally different manner.

Night vision in action ... back to the creepy Santa! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

The SIM card tray supports dual SIM cards or a combination of a SIM card and a microSD/TF card for expanded storage. In terms of security, the device features both a fingerprint sensor and facial recognition, minimizing the time spent entering your passcode.

ZDNET's buying advice

All in all, the Blackview BV7300 is an impressive package, all the more so when you check out the price and find that you can pick one up for $230. The size, weight, and crazy flashlight mean it's not for everyone, but for campers, explorers, and people who work outside, like mechanics and engineers, that light is a pretty neat feature.

There's a big chance we'll be getting a new Google smartwatch next week. We're one week away from the August Made by Google event, the tech giant's annual hardware showcase, and rumors and leaks of what's coming on this next generation of AI-infused devices are swirling.

Also: I've owned every Google Pixel since the first - here's why 2025's will be different

What can we expect from the Pixel Watch 4?

Google could debut new Pixel phones (including a foldable if the rumors are true), Pixel Buds, and maybe even a Google Pixel Watch 4, if I'm lucky. As ZDNET's wearables editor, I'm keeping my eye on the Pixel Watch 4 chatter.

Also: Google will announce its next lineup of Pixels on August 20 - here's what we know

While Google has kept the details of its next hardware release discreet, a few leaks give hints about what to expect with the fourth-generation smartwatch. I've contacted the company for comment and will report back if I get any confirmation.

Keep in mind that these rumors are, well, exactly that. Simply rumors. The true confirmation will only come on August 20 at Made By Google, so be sure to tune in to the livestream at 1 p.m. ET for the latest. For now, let's dive into the most exciting and notable features we could see in the Pixel Watch 4.

1. Sizing and colors

According to rumors, the Pixel Watch 4 is expected to ship in the same sizes as its predecessor: 41 mm and 45 mm.

While sizing is staying the same, the smartwatch's colors are new this year. 9to5Google's Arsene Lupin unveiled a list of the Pixel Watch 4's colorways. They include Black/Obsidian, Gold/Lemon, Moonstone, Silver/Iris, and Silver/Porcelain.

2. Same chipset, new processor

Another rumor suggests that the Pixel Watch 4 will keep the chipset from the Watch 3, the Snapdragon W5 + Gen 1. However, there are murmurs of a new processor entering the smartwatch: Google's M55 processor.

Also: The best smartwatches 2025: I wore these for weeks and found the perfect one for your wrist

This processor should enable the Watch 4 to handle five times the AI power, according to Android Headlines. The Watch 4 is going to need all the AI-processing power it can get, as Gemini arrives on the new smartwatch after debuting on the Galaxy Watch.

3. New and faster charging

Google is switching up its charging port, according to Android Headlines. Instead of a charger that rests on the bottom of the watch, Google is debuting a side-mount charger. The charging contact moved from the back to the left side of the watch, and this position switch might contribute to faster charging.

The 41mm model is slated to get 30 hours of battery life, and the 45mm model 40, according to serial leaker Evan Blass, who posted Pixel Watch 4 leaks on X. The smartwatches will also get 25% faster charging rates, according to Blass.

4. Thicker watch (but bigger battery)

The Pixel Watch 3 is a hefty smartwatch already -- and the thickest I've worn. It could get even thicker, according to 91mobiles, to make room for a larger battery. The site says the fourth-gen watch has a thickness of 14.3 mm.

As someone with a small wrist, this is one unwelcome change I hope won't come to fruition. The major smartwatch competitors, Samsung and Apple, have gone slimmer with their Galaxy and Apple Watches to make the devices more comfortable to sleep in, exercise in, and wear anywhere. That thinness and levity directly relate to comfort and wearability.

However, battery life is a major wearability factor as well, and it's a draw for some users, so what we may sacrifice in chunkiness we make up for in an extended battery.

5. Breathing emergencies feature

According to the folks at Android Headlines, Google will expand its personal safety features with Emergency Satellite Communications and a Breathing Emergencies feature. The SPO2 sensor on the Pixel Watch 4 will monitor blood-oxygen levels and wave the red flag when they've gone too low. Blass's X post also reports heart rate variability monitoring.

6. Two new buttons

91mobiles also spotted two new buttons on each side of the Pixel Watch 4's speaker. If I had to guess their function, I'd bet one is for a health monitor. We're seeing more on-device health functionalities debut on smartwatches.

Earlier this month, Samsung debuted an Antioxidant Index that is activated by pressing a thumb on the smartwatch's BioActive Sensor.

7. Brighter display

The Pixel Watch 4 could be back and brighter than ever, according to Blass. A 3,000 nits display is coming to the smartwatch, Blass reports. This places its brightness on par with the recently debuted Galaxy Watch 8 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2.

8. Repairable (at long last)

One common frustration among wearable health tech users is the device's absolute un-repairability. That could soon change. Android Headlines says that the Pixel Watch 4 could (finally) be repairable, so you won't have to replace the entire watch if your display or battery breaks. This is a great step forward for environmental consciousness, customer satisfaction, and longevity.

Many parts of the US are sizzling right now, unable to escape the extreme heat alerts constantly flashing on the news and our phones. I regularly experienced triple-digit temperatures while living near the desert for ten years. But there's a big difference between that and the 100+ temperatures with humidity levels above 60% many of us are currently experiencing on the East Coast.

Also: Unplugging these 7 common household devices greatly reduced my electricity bill

Like many unlucky Americans, one of the two overworked air conditioner units left us hanging during the latest heat wave. HVAC repair companies are swamped with service requests, and we were struggling, so I pulled out the EcoFlow Wave 3.

This portable unit is an upgrade from its predecessor, the Wave 2, and features Auto, Dehumidify, Sleep, and Pet modes. Aside from being relatively heavy (over 50 lb when you add a battery), the Wave 3 is easy to set up and connect to the EcoFlow mobile app. The device uses Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to connect to your phone, which you can then use as a remote control and to adjust settings, giving you an extra layer of convenience.

I've been testing the EcoFlow Wave 3 sporadically for a few weeks, but began using it more religiously after the summer heat rolled around.

My husband's home office is well-insulated and soundproof, but it's an addition that wasn't properly incorporated into the home's existing HVAC system and doesn't have any windows. As a result, it gets very hot in summer and very cold in the winter.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

This room turned out to be a great place to test the Wave 3 once the dog days of summer began. By routing the exhaust vent through an existing opening built into a wall to route cords, the Wave 3 successfully lowered the temperature by almost 20 degrees in under an hour.

It maintained the set temperature for as long as the device was powered on. The battery lasted a couple of hours when used in Max mode, which is the highest setting, but you can stretch it to up to eight hours when you use it in Eco mode.

I found the EcoFlow Wave 3 best suited for insulated areas over tents and places not built adequately for climate control. It's a helpful comfort measure, but one you shouldn't rely on for safety.

The Wave 3 is more powerful than its predecessor, but it isn't meant to replace a full-size air conditioning unit. It features 6,100 BTU for cooling and 6,800 BTU for heating, which is about half the capacity of a wall-mounted unit that costs around a third of the price. So you're paying extra for the convenience of portability of the Wave 3, especially when paired with a battery and portable solar panels.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

Whether that convenience is worth the price hinges mainly on the individual use case.

Once our upstairs A/C quit in the middle of a heat wave, I had to repurpose the Wave 3 from a testing unit to cool down my kids' playroom during the day and a bedroom at night. The top floor, where the heat concentrates during summer, reached up to 93 degrees, with the outdoor temperature at 102 degrees.

My kids are home for summer break, and they love spending time in their playroom, which has all their toys, craft supplies, and a TV, but they couldn't do it when it was 90 degrees there. I decided to set up the Wave 3 on a table in the playroom and cut out a piece of foam for the window using the stencil included with the unit.

I then routed the inlet and exhaust ducts through the piece of foam and ran the Wave 3 to bring the room's temperature from 86 to 75 degrees. The inlet duct pulls the fresh outside air, while the exhaust vents the hot air from the cooling process. I also ran the drain line out the window to release the water collected during condensation.

Maria Diaz/ZDNET

Admittedly, the Wave 3 struggled to cool down the room efficiently multiple times. For example, it brought the temperature down to 82 degrees in under 20 minutes on one occasion, but then it took over an hour to get to 78. The unit then maintained that temp, even if set to 75. At this time, the outdoor temperature was 96 degrees, with the midday sun shining down on the window next to the Wave 3.

This and other tests made me realize that the Wave 3's cooling capability is limited under extreme conditions, like heat waves. I look forward to seeing how the heating performs during the winter months.

Also: This power station kept my fridge running during an outage

Even so, 78 degrees is much more comfortable for my kids, especially while they were all in the room with the Wave 3. They dove into setting up racetracks and doing crafts, leaving my husband and me able to work uninterrupted.

Because of this, I wouldn't rely on the Pet mode advertised by EcoFlow to keep your pets safe in a hot car. This Pet mode is meant for when you have your Wave 3 and your pet in your vehicle, and you have to leave your furry friend behind. When the EF Wave 3 detects a temperature of 77 degrees or higher, it begins cooling to prevent your pet from overheating.

ZDNET's buying advice

The EcoFlow Wave 3 is built for off-grid adventurers, whether van lifers, RVers, boaters, or tiny home dwellers. However, it isn't meant to be a device you reach for in emergencies. Its performance is limited in extreme conditions, so I'd recommend it to make trips more comfortable, not to prevent heat stroke or hypothermia.

It's a practical device, with improved performance over the Wave 2 and the ability to charge it using solar energy, but it is also pretty expensive. It's effective in up to around 175 square feet but can struggle in larger areas.",,"Maria Diaz, Staff Writer, Aug., At A.M.

For as long as I can remember, I've used a UPS -- aka, Uninterruptible Power Supply -- for various devices: computers, routers, televisions, and more. Those UPS battery backups have saved my hide on several occasions. For example, I've been hard at work on an important project, and the power goes out. Thanks to my battery backups, I have time to save all my work and safely shut down my computer until the power returns.

A UPS should be considered an essential device in this digital age, especially for those who live in places that suffer from regular power surges, brownouts, and more. If you want to keep your devices up and running safely, a UPS is a must.

When I recently received the Goldemate 1000 Pro UPS to review, I was surprised to find I wanted to replace my aging CyberPower UPS. Not only do the Goldemate's specs better those of the CyberPower, but the Goldemate is also more modern-looking.

I know that's trivial, but when you take great pains to keep your office (TV room or whatever) nice and tidy, the last thing you might want is something that looks like a relic from the early 2000s.

My experience

The trouble with reviewing a UPS is that a thorough test requires considerable time. I've had battery backups that lasted many years and some that struggled to reach 12 months before they poop out. I've only had the Goldemate 1000 Pro for a week, but it has performed quite well.

The first thing to know about the Goldemate battery backup is that getting a Lithium-based UPS without having to shell out anywhere between $400 and $1,000 is impressive; at $199, this battery backup is a steal.

Also: The best portable power stations: Expert tested and reviewed

The next thing I appreciated about the Goldemate 1000 Pro was that all eight outlets were of the battery backup and surge protection type. On my CyberPower UPS, only half of the outlets were battery backup, which meant I had to be judicious with what I plugged into it.

However, the strength of the battery is the real selling point of this UPS. I did one real-world test (after charging it to full) by plugging in my System76 Thelio desktop computer and monitor, and then unplugging the Goldemate from the wall to see how long it would keep those two components running.

To my utter shock, the Goldemate was able to keep both the computer and monitor running for nearly two hours until it powered down. Even when my CyberPower UPS was new, I was lucky to get 20 minutes from it during a power outage.

What more needs to be said about this unit?

The only drawback to this UPS is that it doesn't include the ability to communicate with the PC. Without this feature, the UPS cannot instruct the connected computer to gracefully shut down when a power outage occurs. For me, that's not much of an issue because our power rarely goes out, and I'm at home most of the time.

If the power does go out, I can head immediately to my office and shut down anything connected to the UPS. Or, I can hope the power returns within two hours.

If not having a communication port on your UPS is a deal breaker, you'd be best served by finding a different unit. If, however, you do not need your UPS to communicate with your machine and need a UPS with a long-lasting Lithium battery (without having to shell out considerable cash), the Goldemate is a killer bargain.

ZDNET's buying advice

Uninterruptible Power Supplies are not a sexy sell, but if you've ever lost data because a power outage happened while you were working on your latest novel, spreadsheet, or anything important, you understand why these things are so important.

Also: The best home battery and backup systems

Being able to grab a Lithium-based UPS at this price is a steal, and having all eight outlets for battery backup is a bonus. With winter upon us and power outages more likely to happen in certain parts of the country, you should consider purchasing a battery backup, and the Goldemate 1000 Pro sets the gold standard for a cost-effective, powerful UPS.",,"Jack Wallen, Contributing Writer, Aug., At A.M.

ZDNET's key takeaways

AI startups are reaching revenue milestones faster than ever.

A new, AI-native social media giant could emerge.

Startups must be ready for lots of acquisition interest

In its annual overview of artificial intelligence (AI), venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners on Wednesday said that startups it funds -- such as Anthropic, Perplexity, and Canva -- are reaching meaningful turning points in their revenue faster than at any other time in the history of the firm's financing of startups.

""AI-native businesses are scaling from $0 to $100 million in ARR [Annual Recurring Revenue] faster than any other companies in cloud history,"" write lead author Kent Bennett and team in an accompanying essay.

Also: Will AI replace all software? Why GPT-5 emboldens the doomsayers

""It's the highest number of hyper-growth startups we have ever seen.""

AI supernovas and shooting stars

The firm, which has spent $1 billion on startups so far to fulfill a plan announced two years ago, categorizes startups into three classes according to their speed to revenue: supernovas, shooting stars, and cloud centaur. Supernovas are companies that have reached, on average, $40 million in annual revenue after one year in business.

The Bessemer team does not cite any revenue data for individual companies. According to an AI model run by FactSet Systems, four-year-old Anthropic is estimated to have $53 million in annual revenue. According to the same model, Perplexity, founded in 2022, may be generating $10 million a year. Canva's last disclosed revenue count was for $1.7 billion in 2022, according to FactSet. The company was founded in 2012.

Bessemer has a long track record of backing some of the most successful tech firms, including Twilio, LinkedIn, Yelp, Pinterest, and Wix. (See the full list here.)

Bessemer Venture Partners

AI state of play

The report summarizes AI into five categories: infrastructure, development tools, enterprise AI, vertical-market AI, and consumer AI.

The big platforms, provided by OpenAI, Google, and other giants, mean that ""a new infrastructure layer has emerged --spanning models, compute, training frameworks, orchestration, and observability,"" they write.

Also: Why GPT-5's rocky rollout is the reality check we needed on superintelligence hype

But a ""second act"" is unfolding, they argue, wherein the AI giants move beyond benchmark tests to ""building systems that define, measure, and solve problems with experience, clarity, and purpose,"" including establishing the connections from AI models to systems for ""knowledge retrieval, memory, planning, and inference optimization.""

In the dev tools market, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) created by Anthropic is establishing itself as an industry standard, a kind of USB-C to hook things together in AI.

""For developers, MCP radically simplifies integration. For founders, it opens the door to building truly agentic products -- where AI doesn't just assist users, but acts on their behalf across systems,"" they write.

An important element going forward will be how tools incorporate memory and storage, moving beyond early efforts such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Bennett and team relate that ""While the foundational model companies are working on memory, so too are startups like mem0, Zep, SuperMemory, and LangMem by Langchain.""

Also: RAG can make AI models riskier and less reliable, new research shows

In enterprise AI, traditional ""system-of-record"" software such as Salesforce is under attack because AI can make it easier to move away from that software by lowering switching costs, the authors argue.

""For decades, SoRs like Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, and ServiceNow held firm thanks to their deep product surfaces, implementation complexity, and centrality to business-critical data. ""With AI's ability to structure unstructured data and generate code on demand, migrating to a new system is faster, cheaper, and more feasible than ever.""

That observation is especially interesting given how much concern there is nowadays that AI may replace traditional commercial software.

For vertical markets, AI will succeed where broad-based software failed to capture the complexity of individual industries and practices.

""SaaS failed to solve high-value vertical-specific tasks that were multi-modal or language heavy,"" they write. ""Vertical AI is finally meeting these users where they are, with products that feel less like software and more like real leverage.""

The authors believe the payoff from AI's vertical market expertise is strong for buyers. ""ROI is clear from day one and there's no Excel spreadsheet needed to explain it to the user,"" they write. ""These tools unlock 10x productivity, reallocate labor to higher-value work, reduce costs, or drive topline growth. The value is immediate, not a ""nice to have.""

As far as consumer AI, the average consumer up to this point has been exploring ""the novelty and utility of AI,"" and engaging in some limited productivity activities with AI's help, ""such as writing, editing and searching.""

As the interactions have become habitual for consumers, new modes of interaction are emerging beyond simply chatting with a bot.

Five predictions for 2026

Bessemer Venture Partners

Moving from the funding data and state of play, the Bessemer report details five predictions for the year ahead in AI:

The browser will emerge as a dominant interface for agentic AI. Browsers designed for AI agents include Perplexity's Comet Dia browser

2026 will be the year of generative video. Generative AI's video quality will shine in 2006 as ""Model quality -- across Google's Veo 3, Kling, OpenAI's Sora, Moonvalley's Marey, and emerging open-source stacks -- is accelerating,"" they note. ""We're nearing a tipping point in controllability, accessibility, and realism, that will make generative video commercially viable at scale"" in entertainment, education, marketing, social media and retail.

Open questions are whether video will be dominated by the largest AI models, whether open-source will be competitive in video generation, and whether real-time and low-latency uses of video will become important.

Evals and data lineage will become a critical catalyst for AI product development. Current ways of evaluating Gen AI are only offering ""coarse-grained signals at best,"" they write. ""Most every company still struggles to assess whether a model performs reliably in their specific, real-world use cases."" The result is going to be a big advance in custom evaluations, they believe. ""AI evals will go private, grounded, and trusted -- and enterprise deployment will 10x because of it."" Companies profiting from that wave may include startups as Braintrust LangChain Bigspin.ai Judgement Labs

A new AI-native social media giant could emerge. Technology waves always lead to successful startups, so they expect the same will be the case in social media. ""PHP enabled Facebook. Mobile cameras made Instagram possible. Advances in mobile video propelled TikTok,"" the team observed. ""It's hard to imagine that the new capabilities enabled by generative AI won't lead to a similar breakout."" The young contestants include Character.ai Replika

The incumbents strike back as AI M&A heats up. The existing software vendors ""face a stark choice,"" they write, ""evolve or become obsolete."" The team's prediction is that public tech firms will go on a frenzy of acquisitions. ""In 2025 and 2026, we expect to see a surge in M&A activity as incumbents move aggressively to buy their way into the AI era.""

ZDNET's key takeaways

Apple could be developing a new budget-friendly MacBook for around $599.

Rumors state it would house an A18 Pro chipset -- the processor found in the iPhone 16 Pro.

Despite corroboration by industry experts, information is speculative.

About a month ago, rumors starting surfacing that Apple was developing a lightweight MacBook that runs on iPhone hardware. Notable Apple insider Ming-Chi Kuo supported the rumors in a post on X in July, claiming the company was currently working on a ""more-affordable MacBook"" running on the A18 Pro chipset -- the same one found in the iPhone 16 Pro -- instead of an M-series processor.

Also: 5 Apple products you definitely shouldn't buy this month (and 7 to get instead)

Tech news site DigiTimes claims to have recently spoken to an insider with intimate knowledge of this laptop, suggesting the device will cost somewhere between $599 and $699: much cheaper than the M4 MacBook Air's starting price of $999.

Even more notable is the alleged timing of such a product: releasing this fall, just as millions of PC users are looking for a new computer when Microsoft pulls the plug on support for Windows 10.

(Even more) lightweight

The MacBook Air M4 Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

DigiTimes reports this new MacBook will sport a 12.9-inch display, slightly smaller than the MacBook Air's 13-inch screen. What's interesting is that this size closely correlates with what Kuo said a month ago.

In fact, much of the information told to DigiTimes lines up with Kuo wrote. According to the report, components may enter ""mass production"" by the end of Q3 2025 (sometime in September). Then, the laptop will become ""commercially available"" by either late 2025 or early 2026, which, as MacRumors points out, is ""similar to [Ming Chi Kuo's] launch estimation.""

Also: Apple's improved Siri voice assistant may finally have a release date - and I'm ready to ditch Gemini for it

Details, however, remain scarce. There's much we don't know, but it is worth mentioning that the future MacBook is rumored to launch in a variety of colors, including Pink, Blue, Silver, and Yellow, breaking the mold of what MacBooks look like.

Perfect timing

Windows 10 support officially ends on October 14, 2025 as Microsoft aims to push users to Windows 11. If this laptop hits the market in November or December, not only would it be in the middle of the holiday season, but may also prove totally irresistible to Windows 10 users looking for a new device without all the bloat or unnecessary features. That said, it probably won't be a perfect device.

MacRumors mentions the fact ""that the A19 pro chip lacks Thunderbolt support"", meaning the future MacBook could only have regular USB-C ports. Thunderbolt ports have unique features like the ability to send out video signals to multiple monitors simulateanously and lightning-fast data trasnfer speeds.

That could be a dealbreaker for some, but the advent of a low-cost MacBook cheaper than the Air may be too alluring to ignore.

The laptop isn't the only rumored project. Kuo also claimed that Apple is working on a pair of smart glasses set to release in 2027. This pair will reportedly function similarly to Meta Ray-Bans, as it won't have a heads up display. However, he suggested the glasses will provide audio playback, record video, and support ""AI environmental sensing"", with multiple material and style options.

Most of us already know that carrying unencrypted data on portable drives is a bad idea. The consequences of that data falling into the wrong hands can range from embarrassing to damaging to potentially opening up you or your company to legal headaches.

But encrypting data on external drives can also be a pain. If you have to run separate applications, things quickly become a big hassle, and that's how data gets left unencrypted.

Also: 10 tiny tools I carry with me everywhere - and how they work

But what if there was a way of easily encrypting and decrypting data without messing with any applications? Well, there is, and I guarantee you that you'll feel like James Bond every time you use the Kingston IronKey.

The SSD looks like any regular SSD, except it has a screen. It's a touchscreen, and you use this to input your passcode and change the drive settings.

Also: My new favorite keychain holder can carry up to 14 keys (and is trackable by phone)

This drive is one of the easiest and most convenient ways to encrypt data when moving. The initial setup for this drive took seconds -- I had to input my secret passcode -- and it was ready to use.

And use it I have.

This drive has been with me in a handful of countries across three continents and all across the UK, and it's going strong.

And while this drive is very good at securing data thanks to the XTS-AES 256-bit hardware encryption, it does a lot more than that. For example, it has a randomized on-screen keyboard (so finger smudges don't give away your passcode), a read-only mode to prevent data (or malware) from being written to the drive, and an automatic timeout in case you forget to eject the drive.

Why I recommend this product

There's a lot that I like about the Kingston IronKey Vault Privacy 80 SSD. It's also available in four capacities, so you're only buying the amount you need. Mine was the 960GB version, which is fine for me, but if you're a data hog, you can get one that is 7.6TB (that'll set you back a cool $965).

I also like how intuitive this drive is to use. Everything you need to know is on the touchscreen, so you don't have to decipher what some combination of blinking lights means. A screen makes all the difference, and making it a touchscreen makes it convenient and familiar to use.

I've tried a lot of different encrypted drives, but I keep returning to this one. I love how simple it makes encryption. That's quite a challenge, yet the Kingston IronKey Vault Privacy 80 SSD accomplishes it with ease. Simply put, it's an incredible drive to secure your data.

If you have an ESR HaloLock wireless power bank, you should stop using it immediately and contact the company for a refund.

In a post Thursday, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission warned that ESR is recalling certain models of the HaloLock wireless power bank because they're at risk of overheating and catching on fire.

Also: Finally, I found a portable charger that checks all of my boxes for traveling

Users have reported nine instances of a HaloLock igniting, causing about $20,000 in damage. There are no reported injuries. That's a small number, but the company felt the fires alone were enough to warrant a voluntary recall.

About 24,000 units are a part of this recall, plus almost 10,000 more in Canada. ZDNET has reviewed other products in the ESR HaloLock family, and they were all generally well-received.

How to identify the recalled ESR powerbank

The ESR Halolock was sold on Amazon.com, Homedepot.com and Esrtech.com from September 2023 through July 2025 for between $32 and $40. Specifically, you're looking for model numbers 2G520, 2G505B and 2G512B. ""ESR"" is printed on the back, the model number is printed on the right side, and there are five circular LED display lights on one side.

What to do if you have a recalled ESR HaloLock

If you have an affected model, first stop using it. Write the word ""Recalled"" in permanent marker on the device and send a photo of it to support@esrtech.com. ESR will review your submission and, if approved, send you a full refund. The USCPSC warns that you shouldn't throw the powerbank in the trash, the general recycling, or even in used battery recycling boxes found at retail stores, like you might a normal lithium-ion battery. Instead, dispose of it through your local household hazardous waste (HHW) collection center.

You can call the manufacturer at 888-990-0280 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT Monday through Friday for more information.

This announcement comes just after Anker issued a recall for a popular power bank at the end of July and then another about a week later. It also comes as airlines have started to change policies about taking power banks on planes over fire concerns.

Problems aren't happening often, but the National Business Aviation Association said that ""a smoke, fire or extreme heat incident"" involving a lithium-ion battery takes place on a plane more than once per week in the US.

In November of 2022, I decided I needed to organize my pocket EDC (everyday carry) gear. As part of that reorganization, I picked up a KeySmart Air key organizer as a way to both keep my keys sorted and also attach an AirTag to them.

Also: 10 tiny tools I carry with me everywhere - how they work

So, here we are, almost three years on, and I'm still using the KeySmart Air, and while it's looking a little battered, it's still going strong.

The KeySmart Air comes in three versions -- faux leather, leather, and a polymer variant called Flex (I'm sure only the leather and faux leather were available when I bought mine -- and I went for the faux SmartShield leather version because KeySmart said it had a ""rugged leather feel"" yet lasted ""10x longer than traditional leather."" That sounded good to me.

Also: My new favorite keychain holder can carry up to 14 keys (and is trackable by phone)

The idea behind the KeySmart Air is simple -- it's a loop of material where the keys fit onto a screw fastener, and the AirTag fits into a molded loop. Fitting your keys into the holder is quite easy: All you need is a flat-headed screwdriver (or a thin coin).

Simple, but it's super effective.

What I like about the KeySmart line is that they make a ton of cool accessory tools that fit into the Air or their other key organizers, such as a mini knife (not TSA friendly, so be aware of that), a tiny 5-in-1 multitool, a magnetic breakaway connector, and a range of other small but useful multitools. I have quite a few of these accessories; they're all good quality and worth the money.

So, how has the KeySmart Air held up to almost three years of use?

Not bad for close to three years of use. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Very well. Sure, it looks rougher than when I got it out of the box, but it's still perfectly functional and serviceable. The material is still perfectly intact, and the screw fastener that holds the keys is like new. And for $30, I can't complain.

Also: I never leave home without this viral USB-C key ring accessory

One modification that I did to my KeySmart Air was to replace the supplied metal split ring with a KeyUnity titanium D-ring shackle because that was both more convenient and a more robust choice for my setup. It was an easy upgrade to personalize an already valuable tool for my lifestyle.

The KeyUnity titanium D-ring shackle is a good upgrade on the supplied split ring. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Why I recommend this product

Things that are part of my EDC get quite a hard life, and when I picked up the KeySmart Air I was curious to see how well it would hold up. And now several years on, I'm happy to report that it's been fantastic. It's securely held my keys, tools, and AirTag, and has lasted through daily use without a hitch.

It's one of the nicest AirTag holders I've used, far nicer and more compact than the pendant-style holders. I'm not a fan of the silicone AirTag holders because I've had some where the tag has fallen out. There's no chance of that with the KeySmart Air.

The faux leather has held up surprisingly well, but I am curious how well the genuine leather and polymer would hold up. I might get some to test!

Google is bringing generative AI to the skies.

On Thursday, the company announced Flight Deals, a new AI-powered feature within Google Flights that allows you to describe travel ideas conversationally and surfaces relevant flight options from multiple airlines and booking sites.

Also: The 7 gadgets I never travel without (and why they make such a big difference)

The Skyscanner-like search feature will be rolled out in beta over the next week across the US, Canada, and India, with no opt-in required. It can be accessed here or via the menu at the top-left corner of the Google Flights homepage.

What exactly does the tool do?

Google is marketing the new search tool to travelers who are willing to take a more indirect route to their final destination, as long as they can find the most affordable flight option.

""Flight Deals is designed for flexible travelers whose number one goal is saving money on their next trip,"" the company wrote in a blog post. ""Instead of playing with different dates, destinations, and filters to uncover the best deals, you can just describe when, where, and how you'd like to travel -- as though you're talking to a friend -- and Flight Deals will take care of the rest.""

Also: This AI travel agent can plan your next trip's entire itinerary - for free

You don't even need to provide specific details. For example, say you want to plan an affordable ski trip (admittedly a bit of an oxymoron) but aren't sure where, exactly, you'd like to go. Then, as Google writes in its blog post, you can just feed Flight Deals the prompt, ""10-day ski trip to a world-class resort with fresh powder,"" and the system will match that description with bargain flights to locations that may not even have crossed your mind.

Flight Deals can ""understand the nuances of what you're looking for and identify matching destinations,"" according to the company.

The feature is being debuted at a time when Google -- along with most other major tech developers -- is working to infuse its latest AI systems across the full suite of its product offerings. Last week, for example, Google Finance received its own chatbot.

No, you're not seeing double. This is the second review I've done for Lenovo's Legion Go S. However, this one is special because it doesn't run Windows 11 -- it runs SteamOS. That single change in the operating system elevates the Legion Go S from a ""just okay"" gaming handheld to a great one -- rivaling the Steam Deck itself.

Before I break down the handheld, I should explain Steam OS to those who don't know, as the software is at the center of what makes this new model so good.

Also: I replaced my work PC with this Dell laptop, and it was one of my best decisions

SteamOS is a lightweight operating system originally exclusive to the Steam Deck. It delivers a user-friendly interface that isn't bloated with unwanted apps, and more importantly, it's designed specifically for gaming.

It's this streamlined OS is a big reason why the Steam Deck has been so popular -- it's no fuss, no muss. Back in January, Valve (the developer of Steam) announced it would begin licensing the operating system to third-party companies, with Lenovo being the first (and at the time of this writing, only) partner.

A familiar design

Design-wise, it's identical to the earlier model with the only discernable difference being the color. It is now in Nebula purple instead of Glacier White. The device itself is just as comfortable in my hands and doesn't feel bulky. Textured grips on the side stop slipping, hall-effect analog sticks maintain accuracy and prevent drifting, and the switches on the back affect the travel distance for the rear triggers.

Also: This MSI handheld could replace my gaming laptop, and not just for its more portable design

However, the touchpad under the right analog stick has lost its purpose. In the previous model, it was used to control the cursor for various purposes, like navigating a web browser. But, this device doesn't support any browser or apps for that matter -- it's just Steam.

The touchpad can be used in games as another button or to help aim weapons, although performing the latter doesn't feel great. It's so small that it's difficult to get precise movements. Most of the time, I ended up aiming my character in a completely different direction when I meant to shoot the enemy in front of me.

Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET

Gaming on the go

Your gaming experience on the Legion Go S depends on the titles you play. As cool as this handheld may be, it is still just a handheld, not some ultra-powerful desktop. Underneath the hood is an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go processor, an AMD Radeon GPU, and 16GB of RAM. This configuration is much happier tackling lightweight games like ""Hades"" or ""Stardew Valley"". Titles like those run at a consistently smooth 120Hz. It's like art.

AAA games like Monster Hunter Wilds have a harder time running on the Legion Go S. Graphics are blurry, and performance slows down when there's a lot on screen. That sounds like a knock against the device, but the Steam Deck also struggles with the same. It's the nature of the tech, and the fact that it can even run these titles at all is commendable in its own right.

Luckily, you can tweak the hardware's performance on the fly. Pressing the button at the upper right corner of the screen launches the settings menu. Then, just click the lightning bolt icon to open the Performance page where you can tweak the game's performance to best suit your needs.

If you don't want to spend half an hour adjusting the settings like I did, you can just activate a title's default profile. This feature is my absolute favorite. It automatically applies a game's performance profile according to what Steam has for it, taking all of the guesswork out.

Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET

Battery life isn't great. While ""Monster Hunter"", the Legion Go S ran for about an hour and 15 minutes before I had to grab the charger. However, on lighter games like ""Hades 2"", that time went up to two hours.

Lenovo Legion Go S vs Steam Deck

With the release of the SteamOS Legion Go S, I consider the previous Windows model obsolete. This version is the only one you should care about, and it serves as a great alternative to the OLED Steam Deck. Now the question is, what should you get: the Legion Go S or the Steam Deck?

Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET

It's close, but I like the Legion Go S more because of its touchscreen. Lenovo's device has an 8-inch LCD that runs at a 120Hz refresh rate, while Valve's Steam Deck has a 7.4-inch OLED touchscreen that runs at 90Hz max. I value higher refresh rates because they ensure smoother animations and faster response times, which can mean the difference between winning and losing.

On the other hand, the Steam Deck's OLED screen does mean its color output is more impressive.

Also: I replaced my ThinkPad with a dual-screen Windows laptop - here's my verdict after a month

There are other deciding factors to consider. The Steam Deck's OLED display delivers a more vibrant color palette, and Valve's device is lighter at 1.4 pounds, while the Legion Go S clocks in at 1.62 pounds. Also, the Steam Deck has significantly larger touchpads underneath the Deck's analog sticks, which make controlling first-person shooters easier.

ZDNET's buying advice

Lenovo's Legion Go S is on sale for $600 at Best Buy right now, which is a competitive price. I had a blast with this product, and it's a device I would absolutely get for myself, especially on sale.

I admit it: I'm addicted to multitools. My daily carry for the past year or so has been the Gerber Dual Force, which has the most powerful pliers and best screwdriver on a multitool I've used. But the Dual Force is big and heavy, and not suited for lightweight applications like hiking.

It measures a compact 1.97 x 0.63 x 4.12-inches and it weighs a miniscule 2.9 oz. This is a lot smaller and lighter than my Dual Force, which weighs a tiresome 12 ounces.

The NexTool S11 Pro is a lot smaller than the Gerber Dual Force. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

It's also packed with features I rely on when out and about. The pliers are a good compromise of size and performance, the blade is sharp enough for most tasks and holds an edge well, and the screwdrivers and scissors are well designed and do their job well.

It also has a few more specialist tools, like a SIM tray eject tool (which is useful for a lot more things than ejecting SIM trays), and even some neat glow in the dark inserts that make finding the multitool at the bottom of a rucksack or in the undergrowth you've dropped it into, a whole lot easier.

I do like a bit of glow in the dark! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

The tools are also tough, with NexTool having upgraded to 8Cr14Mov stainless steel for the knife blade, a metal that has decent hardness and wear resistance and corrosion resistance, while the scissors, screwdrivers, bottle opener and pliers use 5Cr15Mov, a more general use steel that balanced toughness and corrosion-resistance.

These materials are ideal for a tool that's going to get exposed to rain, salt spray, and sweat, and is going to be asked to handle whatever tasks need handling, from tightening up a screw, to being used like a caveman's hammer.

Anything can be a hammer if you try hard enough. This is how you safely hold a multitool like a hammer. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Also: The TSA-approved multitool myth: I tested it on a plane so you don't have to

Do remember when traveling that this multitool does have a blade on it, and that this can run foul of authorities in some places (think airports everywhere, and places like train stations in Europe). If you want something that's more travel-friendly, I recommend the NexTool Mini Sailor Lite.

The blade is handy, but it makes the NexTool S11 Pro airport unfriendly. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Why I recommend this product

NexTool has been seriously impressing me lately. As someone who used to be a fanboy of expensive multitools, this company proves that a decent quality tool doesn't have to cost an arm and a leg. Sure, there are always compromises, and you don't get 25-year warranties like you get with a Leatherman, but with the NexTool S11 Pro you're buying a tool that costs $30, and for that you still get a very generous 10-year warranty.

For me, this is the perfect tool if I'm trying to keep carry weight to a minimum. I get a set of tools that will handle the basics, without carrying a heavy lump of metal with me on the trail.

ZDNET's key takeaways

Cisco's Secure Firewall Management Center security hole is as bad as they get.

There is no mitigation and no workaround. Patch immediately.

So far, no confirmed active exploits have been confirmed.

Get more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.

Do you use Cisco's Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) software? If your company operates a serious network using Cisco products -- and with Cisco's 76%+ market share of high-end networking, chances are that you do -- you must patch it. Not over the weekend. Not Monday. Right now.

Also: Microsoft patches more than 100 Windows security flaws - update your PC now

Cisco has just patched a critical command injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-20265) in FMC. How critical is critical? Let's put it this way: It has a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 10.0, which is the highest possible risk rating in vulnerability scoring. Specifically, the flaw affects FMC versions 7.0.7 and 7.7.0 that have been configured for RADIUS authentication on the web-based or SSH management interface.

RADIUS is the de facto standard for network authentication. It's the most common implementation used to enable 802.1X access control management. In other words, if you use FMC, it's almost a certainty you're using RADIUS, which means you're vulnerable.

The problem is that because the software didn't sanitize user input in the RADIUS authentication phase, attackers can send crafted credentials that will be executed as high-privileged shell commands. If abused correctly, this can grant anyone full control over the firewall management center.

Adding insult to injury, attackers can exploit the flaw without any prior system access or valid credentials. I repeat: without any prior system access or valid credentials.

This is a security nightmare. Once a hacker has complete control over firewall management, they can do pretty much anything they want to both the firewall and the rest of your network.

The one bit of good news is that Cisco Secure Firewall Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense (FTD) Software are not affected.

Oh, and by the way, Cisco states, ""There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."" You must patch the program. Now.

Cisco reports that there have been no confirmed active exploits in the wild so far. Give it time. The information in the security report is more than enough for a clever hacker to figure out how to exploit this security hole.

So, once more and with feeling, patch it. Patch it now.

Also: Don't fall for AI-powered disinformation attacks online - here's how to stay sharp

Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels. However, given how deep this hole goes, Cisco is also offering the patch for free. In either case, take the following steps:

Go to the official Cisco Security Advisory for CVE-2025-20265. Log in with your Cisco account linked to your organization's support contract. Use the Cisco Software Checker tool or check the Download section of the advisory to identify the specific fixed release for your appliance/version. Download and install the FMC software update for your deployment -- patched versions for 7.0.7 and 7.7.0 are provided.

You know what to do now. Get on with it.",,"Steven Vaughan-Nichols, Senior Contributing Editor, Aug., At P.M.

This watch integrates several Fitbit features, including improved heart rate sensors and GPS tracking, making it secretly the best watch available for both Fitbit and Google Pixel fans.

Who it's for: Google incorporated a running workout builder that gathers your health data over a two-week period and then creates a program that adapts to your data regularly. Real-time guidance is provided as you run, advanced metrics are tracked and then Google shows you how to improve the metrics, a Daily Readiness Score is provided even if you are not a Fitbit Premium subscriber, and Cardio/Target load features are available. The Cardio and Target load features may even trump some of the best sports watches.

Bottom line: If you're a Fitbit fan and are looking for the latest and greatest Fitbit in a watch form factor, then the Google Pixel Watch 3 is the wearable for you. If you also enjoy Google's take on wearables and want years of updates, then this is the watch to consider.

One of the best functions of the Pixel Watch 3 that even beats out the Apple Watch is the focus on safety. While the Apple Watch can appear in your Find My application, and you can share your location with family and friends, that's a passive setting that requires people to physically check the app to find you. The Pixel 3's Safety Check feature allows you to set a check-in timer whenever you're moving from point A to B and want your emergency contacts to be notified if anything goes wrong -- the most reliable feature I've seen on any wearable I've tested. It also supports immediate emergency alerts/SOS and fall detection alerts, similar to the latest Apple Watches.

The new Loss of Pulse Detection feature is available for US owners. This feature has the potential to save lives and I look forward to hearing of success stories soon since my own father could have possibly been saved by this feature.

Review: Hands-on with the Pixel Watch 3: The three features Google got right

Who should look elsewhere: If you use an iPhone, don't even think about the Pixel Watch 3. Google WearOS watches used to work with iOS, but that is no longer the case so you need an Android phone to use this watch. It's also not the best option for those looking for a rugged watch due to its proud display and minimalist form factor.

Why choose a tablet over a phone or laptop? Tablets sit in the middle of smartphones and laptops. They are a compromisable device that allows for a bigger screen than a smartphone for tasks like editing PDFs, streaming movies, or browsing websites, but smaller and more portable than a laptop for note-taking, sketching and drawing, or photo editing. Plus, now many tablets have accessories like styli and keyboards that allow you to use it as a sort of laptop replacement if you're doing relatively easy work on it. Show more

How we test tablets The ZDNET team chose all of the tablets included in this list based on their performance when tested in the real world. When we test tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best. Display : We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy. We also compare the display's performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen's responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer's stylus.

: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy. Performance: For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet's temperature during intensive tasks.

Battery life: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games. Camera and audio: For cameras, we evaluate features like resolution, aperture, low-light performance, autofocus accuracy, dynamic range, color accuracy, image quality, sharpness, and video quality. For audio, we look at the sound quality and overall listening experience, including audio clarity at different volumes, stereo separation of left and right audio channels, maximum volume level in various environments, and if there is perceived distortion. For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive tablet testing methodology. Show more

373,zdnet.com,https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/,The best laptops of 2025: I've tested dozens of laptops and these are the best ones,,"Laptops come in a variety of different form factors these days, with manufacturers playing into the different categories to develop an intended use case. For example, lightweight laptops are made to be carried around, and trade in some raw power for portability. 2-in-1 laptops come with touchscreens that allow for use as a tablet. The best form factor for you reflects how you think you'll use the device.

Lightweight/ultraportable laptops

Made for students, hybrid workers, and anyone who needs to commute with their laptop. These devices have seen a huge explosion in the past few years, becoming thinner and lighter than ever. Some good examples are the Asus Zenbook A14, the Apple MacBook Air M4, and the Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition -- all devices we've tested and love for their ultraportable forms relative to power and battery life.

Business laptops

Designed for the office, these laptops often come with more RAM and local storage, but less powerful GPUs. Their physical designs are often sleek, neutral, and corporate, and they feature lots of ports for compatibility purposes. Premium work laptops may have extra touches like OLED screens (like the HP EliteBook X G1a) or haptic trackpads (Lenovo's ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition) to match the high-end hardware.

2-in-1 laptops

Also called convertibles, these laptops allow for the screen to be folded all the way back so it can act as a tablet or be used in ""tent mode"" to display media. Some 2-in-1 laptops we're big fans of are the Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1 16 and the Dell 16 Plus 2-in-1.

Gaming Laptops

As the name suggests, these are laptops made to run games, and as such come with the hardware to support that. We're talking high-end GPUs, large, vivid displays, and often, RGB lighting and other physical design effects that set them apart from business laptops.

While they're designed to run the latest titles, they also can double as good machines for creatives thanks to their high-end hardware, and as such, tend to be pricier. Some gaming laptops we love are the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i and the Alienware Area-51m 18.

MacBooks

Apple's line of MacBooks are premium devices with a host of features that integrate into the Apple ecosystem. The hardware on MacBooks is arguably some of the best in the industry, with things like gorgeous Liquid Retina displays, crisp, clear webcams, and Apple's line of Silicon processors, which have some of the most impressive performance on the market. The trade-off is the cost, which start around the $1,000 mark and go upwards from there.

Chromebooks

Google's Chromebook lineup uses its own operating system -- ChromeOS -- to power its lineup of light and affordable laptops. Putting a streamlined, limited OS onto a laptop with modest hardware means you forgo the sprawling memory demands of Windows, and run 8GB of RAM smoothly and efficiently.

We're big fans of Chromebooks at ZDNET, with some of our favorites being the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14, the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and the Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE.",,"Cesar Cadenas, Staff Writer, Kyle Kucharski, Alison Denisco Rayome","chromebook, plus, come, ive, highend, ones, power, lenovo, tested, best, run, dozens, hardware, 2025, devices, laptops",pending,2025-08-15T23:57:17.710695+00:00,b0ca6ec05d670217e8b3f1f7e53cea68daf1b5f24be31e1631d5ede1415e1fe8

When our phones need a battery boost, most of us can't stay tethered to a wall outlet. Thankfully, with MagSafe battery packs, you don't have to. The battery market is packed with options that can boost your phone's battery life on the go.

From portable power banks to wireless charging stations, there's something for everyone. I've personally tested over a dozen MagSafe battery packs from brands like Torras and Baseus, evaluating factors like design, function, and value. I've also selectively incorporated other picks based on ZDNET expert reviews and evaluations.

What's the best MagSafe battery pack right now?

Right now, our pick for the best overall MagSafe battery pack is the Baseus PicoGo Magnetic power bank due to its practical design, function, and affordability. Should you prefer a slimmer yet comparable pack, the Torras MiniMag is a personal favorite. In addition, the Zendure Supermini Q or ESR Qi2 10,000mAh battery packs are great options for those who need more power on the go.

I, and other ZDNET experts, went hands-on with several of the top MagSafe battery packs, including every pick on this list. We tested charge speed, function, and other features during our everyday activities. ZDNET's mobile accessory experts carefully test products in our daily lives to provide you with the best advice on what's worth buying and the key features that may or may not suit your lifestyle.

The best MagSafe battery packs of 2025

Show less View now at Amazon View now at Baseus The Baseus PicoGo has a traditional rectangular design with rounded edges and corners, a sleek finish, and indicator lights on the bottom of the pack. It's fairly average weight for a battery, and it comes in four colors -- blue, white, black, and pink. Why we like it: It can charge at 20W with wired charging or at 15W with wireless, magnetic charging. Plus, it can simultaneously charge wirelessly and with the USB-C port for a double device boost. When I tested this pack, it increased the battery of my iPhone 14 Pro from 25% to 60% in 30 minutes. About 40 minutes later, the phone was back up to 80%, with half of the battery capacity still left in the pack. It's priced at only $50. The affixed ring on the back of this pack can be used as a kickstand in any orientation as it fully rotates or used as a phone grip. While I've seen plenty of kickstand features before, I've never seen one like this. Who's it for: Individuals looking for an affordable and practical battery option for MagSafe charging will enjoy this bank. Those looking for a built-in stand configuration and a compact format won't be disappointed, either. Also: I carry this MagSafe battery pack with me everywhere Who should look elsewhere: Some Amazon customers said they don't like the power capacity. A 5,000mAh pack is enough for most people to have on hand for top-offs or while on the go, but it isn't large enough for repetitive recharges. It's enough to charge most smartphone models once fully. If you need more than that, I recommend a larger battery pack.

I like the newly upgraded Qi2 version even more. This new model has the USB-C connector on the side instead of the bottom of the pack, clearer indicator lights and a tad slimmer build. Why we like it: Simply put, this pack works great. Its secure grip and competitive battery speak for themselves. I took this pack to a Yankees game, several late-night outings, work, and even on errands, and I am impressed with the charging. You can expect between a 25-30% battery boost in about an hour to your phone. It also comes with a built-in stand that easily swings in and out. Who's it for: Someone looking for a no-fuss, practical battery pack that doesn't mind a bit of bulk. This battery isn't packed with extra bells or whistles, and it doesn't come in fun colors like it used to. Also: My new favorite MagSafe battery pack supports Qi2 charging, has a kickstand, and isn't made by Anker or Baseus Who should look elsewhere: If you're looking to use a MagSafe battery pack for longer chargers, you'll want a larger capacity pack. If you want a bit more personality or other colors, you'll also want to check out other brands. Apple used to exclusively sell colored iterations of this pack, but it seems to no longer be available.

Factors to consider when choosing a MagSafe battery pack: If you're looking to purchase a MagSafe battery pack, there a few things to keep in mind. Charging efficiency: Most power bank companies claim that your phone should last more than a day with 5,000mAh. Therefore, battery packs within the 5,000-20,000mAh range are likely best for most people's needs.

Pass-through charging capabilities: Chances are it's not only your phone that could benefit from some battery but a whole device ecosystem. Pass-through charging allows other connected devices to charge simultaneously.

How did we test these MagSafe battery packs? ZDNET went hands-on with all of the MagSafe battery packs on this list. We affixed these packs to our own smartphones during our daily lives to test out recharge rate, magnetic strength, pass-through capabilities, comfort, and more. We used them over the course of a few weeks to really get a feel for a product's add-in value. That is, can you ""add-in"" this product into your life and benefit from its presence, or is it just another fad product that's too good to be true or collects dust after the buzz wears off? If we think another product is worth your money, we'll update this list or write up a spotlight review highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for. Plus, we are routinely scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, and following news on product rollouts and upgrades, and sourcing the best deals. We know buying anything in the current economy is not just for your whims, and that's why this list, as well as our other advice, is tailored to your needs, wants, and your budget and why our picks are expert-tested and expert-vetted.

Latest info on MagSafe battery packs in 2025

President Donald Trump's new economic plan could shake up global tech manufacturing -- potentially hitting consumers the hardest. Imports from some countries may decrease in availability and increase in cost more than others. It may be time to take note of products you were looking to buy in the next few months and accelerate your purchasing timeline.

Small tech accessories like chargers, cables, adapters, and MagSafe gear will not necessarily be immune to the current economic times. Many accessories utilize imported metals and materials. However, accessories like MagSafe gear will likely still remain ""affordable"" in comparison to larger tech products like laptops and iPhones that are more likely to see bigger cost increases.

Right now, it looks like some tech may be exempt from the issued tariffs, but since it's always changing and developing, we are keeping an eye on it and will update you on the latest.

371,zdnet.com,https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/,Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options for you,,"If you've been eyeing an Apple iPhone for your next big upgrade, how do you decide which one is best for you? With so many configurations and models available today, and the various software and feature implications that come with, the journey of choosing the right model has never been longer. For years, I've tested every iPhone released, including the large-sized iPhone 16 Pro Max and the budget-oriented iPhone 16e, gathering insights on what models resonate with what type of user.

With iOS 26 officially out in public beta, and the iPhone 17 series expected to launch in a matter of months, the dynamics of how you decide which iPhone model to buy and how you interact with it have just changed again. Notably, the latest software version will likely not be compatible with some older iPhones, including the iPhone XR and XS. So I'd advise against buying those two models, even if they can be had for less money. Instead, I'd consider your best options below.

What is the best iPhone right now?

ZDNET's mobile experts carefully test every iPhone model at release, putting them through their paces to provide you with the best advice on which model to buy and the key features to look out for when you do. Right now, our pick for the best iPhone overall is the iPhone 16 Pro Max, thanks to its vivid and slim-bezel display, extensive camera tools, including a dedicated Camera Control button, and support for Apple Intelligence features. Should you prefer a smaller, easy-to-handle form factor, consider the iPhone 16 Pro.

For most people, the standard iPhone 16 is your best bet if you want the latest iOS 26 features and Camera Control but don't want to spend a thousand dollars. It helps that the base iPhone models this year sport colorful finishes that are sure to appeal.

The best iPhones of 2025

Show less View now at Amazon View now at Apple The iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best iPhone overall due to its highly capable specifications and supersized attributes. It's the iPhone model that sets a new standard for Apple every year and continues to be a worthy competitor to Samsung's S Ultra series and Google's Pixel Pro XL. Why we like it: Besides being the largest iPhone Apple currently offers, with a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, the iPhone 16 Pro Max also has the best-rated battery life of 27 hours of video playback. From our tests, we found the phone lasted much longer than the standard 16 Pro and last year's 15 Pro Max. The iPhone 16 Pro Max looks and feels fairly similar to its predecessor, the iPhone 15 Pro Max, as it's also made of titanium instead of the previous versions' stainless steel. This material choice ""makes the Pro phones about 10% lighter (than their predecessors) and is very durable,"" as ZDNET's editor-in-chief, Jason Hiner, describes it. The one notable hardware change comes in the form of a Camera Control key on the right side of the device. Camera Control lets you quickly turn on the camera app, adjust color tones and other photographic settings, and capture pictures and videos. It's a useful tool that, with a bit of practice, can be essential for creative workflows. Review: iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max Who it's for: The iPhone 16 Pro Max is a flagship phone that commands a flagship price, meaning it's ideal for users who are willing to pay for the best iPhone available, whether that's directly through retailers or through carrier deals. You should buy the Pro Max version if you want the larger screen, enduring battery life, and triple-camera setup. Who should look elsewhere: But if you're shopping on a budget and don't mind a smaller screen, consider the $999 iPhone 16 Pro ($200 cheaper and with a 6.1-inch display). If you can live without the dedicated telephoto lens, you can even go with the $899 iPhone 16 Plus, which features a large screen and battery, but only has wide and ultrawide lenses for shooting. iPhone 16 Pro Max specs: Processor: Apple A18 Pro Bionic | Display size: 6.8 inches with 120 Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 256 GB, 512 GB, 1 TB | Rear cameras: 48 MP wide, 48 MP ultra-wide, and 12 MP 5× telephoto | Front camera: 12 MP | Colors: Natural Titanium, Desert Titanium, White, Black | Weight: 227 g | Starting price: $1,099 Value 8 Performance 10 Battery life 9 Camera quality 9 Display 8 Pros Lightweight titanium shell

It also starts at $300 less than the iPhone 16 Pro series, putting it in closer reach for most consumers Why we like it: The iPhone 16 brings several premium features from the Pro models -- including the Camera Control key, Dynamic Island, and support for Apple Intelligence -- making it feel closer to a Pro than ever before. From our hands-on testing with the model, its slimmer, lighter design with curved edges offers a noticeably more comfortable grip than older iPhones, without sacrificing durability or style. Add in solid battery life, the reliable A18 Bionic chip, and a fun lineup of colors, and you've got a well-rounded device that delivers excellent value. Review: iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus Who it's for: The iPhone 16 is a great choice for anyone who wants a modern iPhone with high-end features but doesn't need -- or want to pay for -- the full Pro experience. If you care about one-handed usability, reliable performance, and a camera that can now shoot macro and spatial videos, the iPhone 16 hits the sweet spot. Opt for the standard size for compact comfort, or go with the Plus model for longer battery life and a bigger screen. Who should look elsewhere: If you're a power user who needs features like a telephoto lens, ProMotion (120Hz) display, or more advanced camera tools, you may still want to spring for the iPhone 16 Pro. Likewise, if you're coming from an iPhone 14 or newer and don't care much about spatial video or macro photography, the upgrade may feel incremental. Budget-conscious shoppers might also prefer to stick with the iPhone 16e or previous-gen models that still offer strong performance at a lower price. iPhone 16 specs: Processor: Apple A18 Bionic | Display size: 6.1 inches and 6.7 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, Black | Weight: 170g | Starting price: $799 Pros Faster MagSafe charging

Show less View now at Apple View now at T-Mobile Going off of retail price alone, the latest iPhone 16e is the cheapest iPhone on the market right now. The $599 starting price comes with its caveats, of course, but there are still several iPhone benefits that may interest budget shoppers. Why we like it: From our tests, the iPhone 16e excels in ways that are essential to most users, from the 6.1-inch OLED display that's both comfortable to hold and easy to view content, to the exceptional battery life thanks to the efficiency of the A18 processor, to the single 48MP Fusion camera that's capable of capturing vivid and detailed imagery. Sure, you'll have to settle with some trade-offs, such as the notched display and lack of MagSafe connectors. Still, the overall experience of the iPhone 16e, which runs on iOS 18 with most Apple Intelligence features, makes it a reliable handset for hundreds less than the flagship iPhones. Review: Apple iPhone 16e Who it's for: The iPhone 16e is ideal for shoppers who want the quintessential iPhone experience -- FaceTiming in decent camera quality, iMessage texting with the latest chat features, firing up multiple apps in sequence, etc. -- but don't want to spend a grand on a phone. As ZDNET's Sabrina Ortiz said after switching over from an iPhone 16 Pro, ""I am equally impressed as I am surprised."" Who should look elsewhere: The absence of MagSafe was one of our main critiques when testing the iPhone 16e, so if you're already accustomed to the popular accessory mechanic, you'll want to consider alternatives that support the feature, like the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15. The premium iPhone models also offer more flexible camera capabilities, including dedicated telephoto and/or ultrawide lenses. iPhone SE specs: CPU: Apple A18 | Display: 6.1 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Internal storage: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: 48MP wide | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Black, White | Weight: 167g | Starting price: $599 Pros The most affordable new iPhone in 2025

It's a great pick if you're willing to buy a refurbished one and want something slightly less outdated than the iPhone SE (2022). The iPhone 13 Mini is also a great option for users who want a spare phone for business or creative purposes. Who should look elsewhere: If battery life, screen size, or multitasking are high priorities, the iPhone 13 Mini will fall short. Its smaller display isn't great for media consumption, and the compact battery won't match the endurance of larger models we've tested. Anyone needing the latest features or preferring to buy new might be better off with a current-generation iPhone like the iPhone 15 or iPhone 16e, despite the trade-offs. iPhone 13 Mini specs: Processor: Apple A15 | Display size: 5.4 inches with 60Hz refresh rate | Storage options: 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | Rear cameras: Two 12MP (wide and ultra-wide) | Front camera: 12MP | Colors: Starlight, Midnight, Red, Pink, Blue | Weight: 141g | Starting Price: $350 Pros Last iPhone Mini model you can buy

Why we like it: The iPhone 15 hits a sweet spot in Apple's lineup, offering many of the features previously reserved for Pro models -- like the Dynamic Island, USB-C charging, and a sleek, contoured design -- at a more accessible price. It's powered by the A16 Bionic chip (the same one used in the iPhone 14 Pro), making it fast and capable for everyday use, from gaming to multitasking. Both the standard and Plus models are also receptive to Apple's iOS 26 update, so you'll gain access to the Liquid Glass redesign, enhanced CarPlay experience, and more. Combine that with one of the brighter Super Retina XDR displays we've measured and an improved 48MP main camera, and you get a phone that feels like a serious upgrade without the Pro price tag. Review: Apple iPhone 15 Who it's for: This is the iPhone for people who want modern features, strong performance, and great cameras without splurging on a Pro model. It's ideal for everyday users who care about photography, video, and overall speed but don't necessarily need a ProMotion display or a telephoto lens. Starting at $699 -- or less if you shop around -- it's a smart buy for most people who want a current-generation iPhone that's built to last. Who should look elsewhere: Power users who want the absolute best camera setup, a 120Hz display, or advanced editing tools may still prefer the iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro. And if budget is your biggest concern, the iPhone 14 or 16e might be a better fit -- especially if you don't mind sacrificing some modern design touches.

Top iPhone models compared After weighing out the specs and reviewer-tested experiences, the best iPhone is currently the iPhone 16 Pro Max. It's got a beautiful AMOLED display, a powerful (and future-proofed) chipset, and a reliable camera system that covers all the bases and angles. Naturally, the 16 Pro Max is also Apple's most expensive model, so if pricing is a concern, consider cheaper options like the iPhone 16e and even older models. iPhone models compared Base Price Base Storage Display Processor Cameras (rear) iPhone 16 Pro Max $1,099 128GB 6.8 inches A18 Pro Three iPhone 16 $799 128GB 6.1 inches A18 Two iPhone 15 $699 128GB 6.1 inches A15 Two iPhone 13 Mini $480 128GB 5.4 inches A15 Two iPhone 16e $599 128GB 6.1 inches A18 One Show more

Are iPhones the best smartphone? The answer depends on your needs and preferences. For example, while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is ZDNET's current pick for best phone of 2025, it may not be the best option for you if you often rely on services like iMessage and FaceTime, which are exclusive to Apple's operating systems. Previously, the gap between iPhones and Android phones was much larger due to Apple opting for a Lightning port instead of USB-C, but with the iPhone 15 models switching to the more universal port for charging and data transfer, it's become less intimidating to switch from Android to iPhone, and vice versa.

Which iPhone model is right for you? It used to be fairly easy to choose an iPhone model as you typically opted for either the ""big"" iPhone or the ""small"" one. With four models available in the iPhone 16 series alone, you now have to dig a bit deeper to choose which is best for you. This is especially true of the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro, which feature nearly the same hardware, so check out our question above for more on this decision. Size is generally the first factor to consider, followed by price. Price limits will also drive the amount of internal storage you select for your iPhone. One fantastic aspect of the iPhone is that all models receive software support for years and years, so it's perfectly viable to buy an older model and trust that it will work well for you for quite some time. Choose this iPhone... If you want... Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max The top-of-the-line iPhone experience. Buy the Pro Max if you want the largest iPhone available without any of the compromises found on other models. This variant, along with the Pro, will also support Apple's existing (and upcoming) AI features. Apple iPhone 16 A reliable iPhone that now includes several Pro features. For most users, the standard iPhone 16 should be more than enough. Apple iPhone 16e The iPhone 16e is the cheapest model that Apple officially sells. You'll have to settle with a smaller, MagSafe-less design, but the performance makes up for it. Apple iPhone 13 Mini The only iPhone Mini that Apple makes. This is arguably the best compact smartphone money can buy, even if it's nearly three years old. Apple iPhone 15 An older iPhone that can handle modern-day tasks. The iPhone 15 is still a solid smartphone if you want the Apple experience for less, and it supports USB-C. Show more

Factors to consider when choosing an iPhone We chose these smartphones by testing them for weeks and months, evaluating them based on real-world applications like phone calls, messaging, web browsing, and taking way too many pictures and videos. ZDNET's mobile experts also liaise with industry colleagues and analysts who have hands-on experience with the handsets, sifting through the iPhone pile for the best of the best. Here's the breakdown of what factors we look for. Display : Possibly the most overlooked feature on a smartphone, the display is what you stare at, scroll at, and interact with day in and day out. Therefore, when picking the best iPhones -- no matter the budget -- ZDNET puts an emphasis on devices with above-average panels. Ideally, a good display covers a wide color gamut, is durable, and has a high refresh rate for the smoothest visuals.

How we test iPhones ZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every major iPhone release, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations: Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.

How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing. Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, with all background tasks closed, and with as stable of a mobile connection as possible.

Latest news on iPhone There are two major iPhone news stories that you should be aware of right now. First, Apple just released the public beta of iOS 26, meaning general consumers can now test the upcoming software version ahead of its September (typical) release. iOS 26 introduces key changes to how apps and interfaces are visualized, due to the new Liquid Glass design language, as well as usability enhancements across popular services like Messages, Phone, CarPlay, and Photos. Of course, you'll need to use a compatible iPhone model to enroll in the public beta; anything from the iPhone 11 and onward should qualify. The second big news story concerns the iPhone 17 series, which is expected to launch in September in five different models: iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Plus, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and iPhone 17 Air (or Slim). Recently, X user @Skyfops shared two images of what can be assumed to be an Apple employee handling a test-development iPhone in California. Also: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes While the product in question is encased in a security cover and privacy screen protector, the unique camera module on the back suggests that the person is holding an iPhone 17 Pro, with the LiDAR sensor and flash embedded on the right side of the device. The rumored horizontal camera bar, considered one of the more significant iPhone hardware changes in recent years, will be a welcome change. It suggests that Apple will give the upcoming iPhone models a noticeable upgrade in camera optics. (It also tells me that the iPhones will rock a little less when set on a table.) Show more

How do I take care of my new iPhone? There are several ways you can keep your iPhone clean and pristine. One way is by equipping a protective case and/or screen protector. The best iPhone cases offer reliable drop and scratch protection, won't bulk up the phone, and may feature some extra utility like a kickstand or MagSafe ring. As for screen protectors, tempered glass options are your best bet to keep the display underneath free of scratches and cracks. They're relatively affordable, too, often coming in multipacks for less than $10. Battery management is another key aspect of iPhone maintenance. To keep your device running for as long as possible, consider charging it between 20% to 80% battery. Overcharging the device would otherwise wear down the battery and reduce the health value (found in Settings). When your iPhone battery health is low (anything less than 75% typically is), it would be helpful to get it replaced at an Apple store or by an Apple-authorized technician. As stressful as it may be to clear up space to download that software update, you absolutely should. Besides fixing any bugs on your iPhone, software updates also bring with them security patches to reduce the chances of your phone getting hacked. Show more

Latest information on iPhones in 2025

What are the tariffs in the US? The recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production. Smartphones are among the most affected by the new US tariffs, with devices imported from China and Vietnam facing steep duties that could raise retail prices by 20% or more. Brands like Apple and Google, which rely heavily on Asian manufacturing, may either pass these costs on to consumers or absorb them at the expense of profit margins. The tariffs could also lead to delays in product launches or shifts in where and how phones are made, forcing companies to diversify production to countries with more favorable trade conditions. Show more

Is the $2,300 iPhone pricing legit? Some analysts have warned that companies such as Apple might pass these tariff costs onto buyers, potentially leading to significantly higher prices, with one estimate suggesting the iPhone 16 Pro Max could reach $2,300. Also: Worried about a $2,300 iPhone? How US tariffs are causing tech buyers to scramble In response, companies like Apple are reportedly exploring alternatives, such as increasing iPhone imports from India. Therefore, it's reasonable for consumers considering new tech purchases to potentially buy sooner to avoid these price hikes or to consider refurbished devices as a cost-saving measure. Show more

iPhone FAQs Will my iPhone support iOS 26? The next version of iPhone software is iOS 26, and it will be supported by the most recent models, including the iPhone 16 series, iPhone 15 series, and iPhone 14 series. Apple has confirmed that the now seven-year-old iPhone XS and XR models will not be eligible to be updated to iOS 26, as the company typically cuts off support after that time span. Show more What is the new iPhone? The newest iPhone is the iPhone 16e, which starts at $599, making it the company's most affordable handset in its storefront. For the price, you get a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display, Apple Intelligence support, an A18 chip, a single 48MP main camera on the rear, and a USB-C port for data transfer and charging. Show more Should I buy the iPhone 16 or wait for the iPhone 17? You should buy the iPhone 17 if... You want the best camera system on an iPhone

You can wait until September to learn more about what's new

You're interested in an ultra-slim iPhone that's lighter than normal handsets You should buy the iPhone 16 if... You require a new phone immediately; perhaps your existing handset broke or is unusable

There's a great deal on the older handset at your carrier or local retailer Show more Which iPhone is better, 15 or 16? Between the two latest generations of iPhones, here are the key reasons to buy one over the other: You should buy the iPhone 16 if... You want an iPhone that will last you for more than a day; the iPhone 16 Pro Max is great for this

You want access to the latest Apple Intelligence (AI) features and don't have a 15 Pro model You should buy the iPhone 15 if... You can find a good deal on a used, second-hand model Show more Lightning port vs. USB-C One of the biggest upgrades when Apple launched the iPhone 15 series was the USB-C port, a faster, more powerful, and more universal charging standard than the Lightning port on previous models. There's really no argument for the Lightning port unless you still own legacy Apple accessories, like the AirPods, and would much rather stick with the one charging standard. Also: Best USB-C chargers and accessories: Expert tested Otherwise, even if you own an iPad or MacBook, or almost any other non-Apple gadget, USB-C is more widely used and truly the one-size-fits-all option for charging and transferring data. Show more Which iPhone models support Apple's new AI features? Apple's existing (and upcoming) AI features, branded as ""Apple Intelligence,"" are available on iPhones with at least an A17 Pro processor. That means the iPhone 16 series and 15 Pro series will support the AI tools. Show more What storage size should I buy for my iPhone? It wasn't until 2021 that Apple began selling both its non-Pro and Pro iPhones with a base storage of 128GB. The only exception here is the iPhone SE model. While not as flashy of an upgrade as larger camera sensors and 120Hz displays, this double-up of storage meant that consumers had more space than ever to store apps, photos, videos, and more. Maurice Klaehne, senior market research analyst at Counterpoint Research, suggests that higher storage options are generally better as they will help with the longevity of the device, and his firm has generally seen an uptick in postpaid customers opting for higher storage sizes when they can afford them. ""Currently, the 256GB option is sufficient for most people,"" Klaehne adds. Show more Should I trade in my old iPhone? Trading in an old iPhone is one of the easiest (and safest) ways to replace an otherwise unwanted device with a new, more capable one. Most retailers, including Apple, accept trade-ins of older iPhone models, with store credit ranging from as low as $50 to $800; it all depends on which generation your iPhone is, the condition, and whether it turns on or not. Show more Is the iPhone 17 out yet? The iPhone 17 series is expected to launch in September 2025, with there being potentially four new models: the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. The Air model is only rumored, but features a thinner design for better portability. Show more Do I really need an iPhone case? While an iPhone case is not a necessity -- your iPhone will still function normally without it -- having one on greatly reduces the chances of wear and tear. For example, the best cases are military-grade certified, meaning they'll keep your iPhone protected from waist-high drops. Not only do cases reduce the chances of your phone getting cracked or scratched, but the plastic/rubberized material often provides more grip than if you hold your iPhone naked. Show more Which iPhone should I buy for a parent? At the time of writing, the iPhone 16 is the best phone to buy for a parent. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles as its Pro siblings, but the iPhone 16 model has all the essential features in 2025, from eSIM support to a reliable battery and charging experience to a display large enough for any form of content consumption. It also comes in a Plus size if you require a bigger screen size. From our testing, the cameras on the iPhone 16 are reliable enough for clear video calls, the occasional outdoor photo, and capturing images of children and pets. Show more What is eSIM? Embedded Subscriber Identity Module, or eSIM in short, is the electronic version of the classic SIM card. That means your eSIM carries your phone number, mobile data plan, and telephone carrier info, just like a regular SIM card. The major difference between eSIM and SIM is that the former does not need to be physically installed onto your phone, which is why the iPhone 14, 15, and 16 lines no longer have a dedicated slot for it. Instead, you'll have to transfer the information wirelessly via Apple's file transfer service, or with the help of your local carrier representatives. Also: eSIM vs. SIM: What's the difference? There is one problem that ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner sees with Apple forcing eSIM adoption on US consumers. ""There are a variety of good reasons why some people will still need or prefer a phone with a physical SIM card. The top reason is privacy. This is especially true for some journalists and populations at risk of persecution around the world. Removing the physical SIM card option reduces privacy for millions of people, especially some of the most vulnerable,"" said Hiner. Note that if you buy an iPhone 14, 15, or 16 anywhere outside of the U.S., the device will come with a regular SIM card slot. Show more Which iPhone models support 5G? All models within the iPhone 16, 15, 14, and 13 line, as well as select iPhone 12 models, support 5G wireless technology. Even the new iPhone 16e supports Sub-6, low-band 5G networks. 5G continues to roll out across the US, and while it is debatable if there are benefits to the speeds of the network, in my experience, the broad coverage of low-band 5G has solved my connectivity issues in spotty coverage areas with past iPhone models. Even more importantly, the 5G iPhone models have Qualcomm chipsets inside that are proving to provide better RF reception than we saw in past iPhones that had Intel chipsets. Show more Which iPhone models support wireless charging or MagSafe? All of the iPhone models in this list support Qi wireless charging technology, which is becoming an expected feature for modern smartphones from all manufacturers. Meanwhile, Apple's proprietary MagSafe technology is only supported by the iPhone 16, iPhone 15, iPhone 14, iPhone 13, and iPhone 12 models. (Notably, the latest iPhone 16e does not support MagSafe.) Also: Best MagSafe accessories for your iPhone MagSafe provides a secure magnetic connection system so that you can connect to wireless chargers with perfect positioning and alignment. MagSafe can also be used with other accessories, such as wallets and kickstands. While the extra security when your iPhone is docked to a wireless charger can be a nice bonus, it's not vital and probably shouldn't be a major determiner in your choice. Apple's first-party wallets and battery packs that use MagSafe have also received somewhat mixed reviews, making them a hard sell for all except the most die-hard Apple enthusiasts. Show more How many years do iPhones typically last? While this number varies greatly depending on how you handle a smartphone -- perhaps you're a construction worker whose phone will be put through the harshest climates or you have kids who may drop the phone ever so often -- the iPhone will typically run efficiently for three to four years. Then, you'll likely experience more frequent app crashes, lag, storage problems, and more. Those are common issues that any piece of technology will inhibit, not just the iPhone, after years of constant usage. If you'd like to prolong that time, I'd recommend visiting your local Apple store to have the phone's battery replaced every three to four years and also consider backing up files to an external hard drive for safekeeping. As a last resort, a factory reset, followed by data restoration, should give your phone a brand-new feel. Show more

370,zdnet.com,https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/,The best phones to buy in 2025,,"I've used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset. Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone right now:

Speeding up your smartphone

Something I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access, but rules were meant to be broken, right?

To turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From within, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from the 1x default setting to .5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.

Optimizing your battery health

To preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn -- or degrade -- the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.

When in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.

How to keep your phone clean

Unless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Apple Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at one meter deep.

Occasionally, take an alcohol pad and give your phone a wipe-down. If you think about it, your phone is just as likely to accumulate germs as your hands, so don't forget to clean it.",,"Kerry Wan, Managing Editor, Allison Jewell","developer, water, settings, phone, buy, transition, battery, best, charge, phones, options, tap, 2025",pending,2025-08-15T23:57:13.407638+00:00,7ef848956cbb1621c6cca3c806c9898afe071c5c0da9417286b0b4447976d33a

What is the best AI chatbot right now?

In May 2024, OpenAI supercharged the free version of ChatGPT, solving its biggest pain points and lapping other AI chatbots on the market. For that reason, ChatGPT moved to the top of the list, making it the best AI chatbot available now. However, sometimes, like in the past week, ChatGPT servers can go down, and you may need a backup.

What is an AI chatbot? An AI chatbot (also called an AI writer) is a type of AI-powered program capable of generating written content from a user's input prompt. AI chatbots can write anything from a rap song to an essay upon a user's request. The extent of what each chatbot can write about depends on its capabilities, including whether it is connected to a search engine. Show more

How do AI chatbots work? Chatbots use LLMs to train the AI to produce human-like responses. Some tools are connected to the web and that capability provides up-to-date information, while others depend solely on the information upon which they were trained. Show more

How much do AI chatbots cost? AI chatbot programs vary in cost. Some are entirely free, while others cost as much as $600 a month. However, many, like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and YouChat, are free to use. Show more

What is the difference between an AI chatbot and an AI writer? The main difference between an AI chatbot and an AI writer is the type of output they generate and their primary function. In the past, an AI writer was used specifically to generate written content, such as articles, stories, or poetry, based on a given prompt or input. An AI writer outputs text that mimics human-like language and structure. On the other hand, an AI chatbot is designed to conduct real-time conversations with users in text or voice-based interactions. The primary function of an AI chatbot is to answer questions, provide recommendations, or even perform simple tasks, and its output is in the form of text-based conversations. While the terms AI chatbot and AI writer are now used interchangeably by some, the original distinction was that an AI writer was used for generating static written content, while an AI chatbot was used for conversational purposes. However, with the introduction of more advanced AI technology, such as ChatGPT, the line between the two has become increasingly blurred. Many AI chatbots are now capable of generating text-based responses that mimic human-like language and structure, similar to an AI writer.

Just type a simple prompt and generate a visual representation of whatever you're imagining. The possibilities are endless.

These AI generators can be used for personal projects such as creating greeting cards, event invites, and wallpapers, or for professional projects such as developing brand assets, social media content, or marketing campaigns. There are so many AI image generators on the market that excel at different tasks, and to help you decide which to use for your needs, we tested all of the models and compiled all the findings below.

Testing Methodology

Since image generators became popular at the end of 2022, many advancements have been made. As a result, they are much more capable and can tackle complex prompts such as human faces and text in a highly realistic manner. I've been testing AI image generators since 2022 and have had to update my methodology several times to keep up with the pace.

For my most recent round of testing, I gave each image generator tool the same prompt: ""a person standing in front of the camera smiling with a green colorful pasture in the background with a sign that says 'green meadows'."" I also included screenshots to help you decide which tool best matches your needs.

Also: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot and worthy alternatives

From ChatGPT's brand-new GPT-4o image-generating model to more established competitors, such as Midjourney, there were some overall really impressive results. Some things to look out for are how well it outputs text, human characteristics, and the background. Because the first two are extra challenging to do well, it is worth separating each element from the others as you analyze the image, especially because you likely will have a use case that needs to be good at all three simultaneously.

Since the image quality is only one factor in choosing an image generator, I also included details on cost, speed, accessibility, and other standouts from my testing. You can also filter the data based on your needs to reflect what you need to see the most.

What is the best AI image generator overall?

In my most recent test, Google's Imagen 3 remains as the top free image generator, since it can produce realistic, detailed, results, including text. Its competitive advantage is that it is entirely free to access, and just as good as models that require hefty subscriptions, combining accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness and can generate images in seconds.

Also: Is that image real or AI? Now Adobe's got an app for that - here's how to use it

However, in this round, ChatGPT's newest model is what really surprised me. OpenAI's DALL-E 2 made a huge splash as the first mainstream AI image generator. Since then, DALL-E 2 was discontinued and its more advanced model, DALL-E 3, also paled in comparison to competitor's models.

However, OpenAI recently released its GPT-4o image generation model which is tremendously better than its predecessing models. It can tackle a range of tasks really well including people, scenery, text, posters, room renderings, and more. In addition, with the subscription that gets you higher limits, you can also access the entire suite of ChatGPT premium features, which even includes its Sora video generator. For that reason, it is the best AI-paid image generator.

As a result, it's not surprising that its Firefly image generator is impressive. Accessing the generator is easy: Visit the website and type a prompt for the image you'd like generated.

What are AI image generators capable of? An AI image generator is software that uses a generative AI model to create images from user text inputs, usually within seconds. The pictures vary in style depending on the software's capabilities, but they can typically be rendered in any style you want: 3D, 2D, cinematic, modern, Renaissance, and more. If you've ever searched Google for hours to find an image you needed, artificial intelligence (AI) may be able to help. With AI image generators, you can type in a prompt that is as detailed or vague as you'd like. These tools can help with branding, social media content creation, and making invitations, flyers, business cards, and more. Another major perk of these generators is that they take seconds to generate, with the longest generation taking about a minute. Even if you have no professional use for AI, don't worry -- the process is so fun that anyone can (and should) try it out. Show more

Do you need to pay for AI image creators or are the free versions good enough? Ultimately, whether you should pay for an image generator or not depends on your use cases. If you are a business and need a commercially safe generator or the highest quality renditions, then paying for services like Midjourney or Generative AI by Getty Images makes sense. If you are a consumer looking to generate images occasionally for fun and leisure, then there are plenty of highly competent free AI image creators, and I would advise you not to pay for a subscription. Lastly, if you are a power AI user, many subscriptions, such as ChatGPT Plus, also include advanced AI and chatbot features that may make it worth it. Show more

How do you use AI image generators? Like other generative AI models, AI image generators require a lot of data. Typically, these models are trained on billions of images, which are then used to in turn create impressive images. Follow these simple steps to get started using one yourself: 1) Visit the website of the generator you are interested in using. 2) Sign in or create an account if the site requires you to have one to access the generator. 3) Type a detailed prompt about what you'd like the generator to output.

How did I compare these AI image generators? To find the best AI image generators, I tested each generator listed and compared their performance across UI/UX, image results, cost, speed, and availability. Each AI image generator had different strengths and weaknesses. UI/UX: The interface design and overall user experience are a big factor. Even though using an image generator should be as simple as typing in a text prompt, some platforms overcomplicate things, making it hard to get started.

Image quality: If you use an image generator, it is likely because you want to produce high-quality art, pictures, or other media. Therefore, one of the biggest factors is the ability to create realistic and detailed images with as few artifacts as possible.

Price: There are so many great free AI image generators. We thus want to ensure that if you have to pay to use a model, it is worth every penny, since some free generators can produce incredible outputs.

Speed: Many image generators can produce images in seconds, setting the expectation for image generators to be quick. Therefore, it is noticeable when a model takes longer. Slowness is a significant con.

Safety: The guardrails that the image generator has in place prevent spreading misinformation, creating deepfakes, and stealing artists' work are also heavily evaluated. Show more

What's the future for AI image generators? Many AI image generators on the market shine in terms of speed, quality, and affordability. That said, there isn't much more I'd like to see from image generators that could significantly improve the offerings. Furthermore, the future of AI image generators isn't about updating current offerings, but rather moving from one-dimensional to three-dimensional renditions. Some companies, such as Stability AI, already have 3D object image generators, such as Stable Video 3D, which generates 3D objects from single images. Text-to-image video generation is also the next big thing, with many companies, including OpenAI, Google, and Stability AI, already working on their own generators. Show more

Frequently Asked Questions



What is the best free image generator?

Google's Imagen 3 is the best free AI image generator because it produces the highest-quality, most realistic image for free.

How do you fix a poorly generated image?

You can fix a poorly generated image by readjusting your prompt to fix the element of the image you are having trouble with. For example, if you say, ""Generate an image of the beach,"" and are disappointed at the way the ocean looks, you can input another prompt that says, ""Generate an image of a beach with crystal blue, shallow water."" The more specific you get, the better your result will be.

Are there ethical implications with AI image generators?

AI image generators are trained on billions of images from across the internet. These images are often artworks belonging to specific artists, which an AI tool repurposes to generate your image. Although the output is different, the new image has elements of the artist's original work that are not credited to them.

Are AI-generated images copyrighted?

Whether an AI-generated image is copyrighted depends on the terms of the generator you are using. The copyright policies also vary between subscription tiers. The best way to proceed is not to assume and to double-check before you use or publish a generated image.

How do I properly disclose that my images were AI-generated?

A good habit when using AI to generate images is to disclose that AI was involved in the process. Doing so helps build trust with your audience, as well as helps prevent misinformation from spreading. A disclosure can be as simple as something that reads, ""Generated by [the name of the generator].""

You will notice that at ZDNET, we always disclose when we use an AI image generator image in an article, using a disclosure such as, ""Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNET via [Image generator name].""

A VPN encrypts your data and conceals your Internet Protocol (IP) address, making it a great tool for general online use, traveling, and streaming. VPNs route traffic through their server network, assigning users new IP locations and preventing tracking, targeted advertising, and data theft.

VPNs are not a silver bullet for security, but the best VPN services will protect your privacy without significantly impacting your speed or browser sessions. They may also offer additional privacy features, including ad-blocking, phishing domain detection, data breach scanners, and password managers.

What is the best VPN service right now?

My pick for the best overall VPN is NordVPN. Based in Panama and subject to strict data protection laws, NordVPN is a top contender in the VPN space. NordVPN offers the full package -- fast speeds, stable connections, an expansive server network, and excellent streaming capabilities. It's not the cheapest VPN, starting at $3.39 per month, but if you want a solid, versatile VPN backed by solid customer support, NordVPN is for you.

My second choice is ExpressVPN, a secure and easy-to-use VPN that provides users with some of the best speeds around. Expect to pay $4.99.month on a two-year plan, although you also receive four months of free service on signup.

Also: The best VPNs for streaming: Expert tested

The ZDNET team has decades of experience in the VPN arena. I've tested all the best VPNs on the market, rigorously evaluating them through frequent speed tests and ranking them based on the number of servers, security features, price, and more. If you're interested in signing up for a VPN, pick a trustworthy service that doesn't vastly impact your speed or internet connection. You should also consider the size and variety of its server network and how the VPN provider treats user data.

The best VPNs of 2025

Show less View now at NordVPN NordVPN is one of the most widely used VPNs, and for most users, it ticks all the boxes. It's secure, fast, suitable for streaming, and has all the features you'll likely need. Why we like it: NordVPN is fine for basic use but offers many features beyond a mere VPN tunnel, including support for peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and an optional second layer of encryption through Double VPN. This allows you to set up a dedicated IP address to run a VPN that also acts as a server. I've found it to be one of the fastest VPNs with the most consistent speed measurements and rapid initial server connectivity. It's still worth noting that rival ExpressVPN is slightly faster. In my tests with Netflix, NordVPN emerged as a top VPN for streaming content with a high success rate in accessing geo-blocked content. When set up with the Privacy Hero 2 router, it also did exceptionally well in accessing streaming services worldwide. This year, the company launched , a new protocol designed to allow users to connect to VPN servers from networks that typically limit traditional VPN traffic and have restrictive network policies. In a new service update, NordVPN has revealed the release of a full graphical user interface (GUI) for Linux. NordVPN also features a kill switch that activates if your connection suddenly drops, protecting your connection and data. In its fifth independent , NordVPN says its no-logs policy has been verified. Review: NordVPN: Consistent speed and performance Who it's for: Those who want the best overall VPN around. It's a solid, fast VPN to use across different devices, and for a relatively affordable price. NordVPN is compatible with all major platforms and provides a server network of 111 countries, and it allows you to connect 10 devices simultaneously under one account. It's also excellent for streaming. Who should look elsewhere: NordVPN will suit most users' needs, but if you want speed first, ExpressVPN might be the right alternative. You can pick between three types of plans with two-year, one-year, or one-month contract terms, depending on whether you want advanced features such as a password manager, data breach scanner, cloud storage, or file encryption. Prices start at $3.39 per month on a two-year plan or $4.99 per month for a one-year subscription. Alternatively, you can try out NordVPN for a month and take advantage of the organization's 30-day money-back guarantee.

It's secure, fast, suitable for streaming, and has all the features you'll likely need. Why we like it: NordVPN is fine for basic use but offers many features beyond a mere VPN tunnel, including support for peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing and an optional second layer of encryption through Double VPN. This allows you to set up a dedicated IP address to run a VPN that also acts as a server. I've found it to be one of the fastest VPNs with the most consistent speed measurements and rapid initial server connectivity. It's still worth noting that rival ExpressVPN is slightly faster.

Show less View now at ExpressVPN ExpressVPN is my top choice for the fastest VPN service around. Why we like it: Customers say it delivers a speedy and consistent connection, and I agree. NordVPN and ExpressVPN are well-matched in speed, but ExpressVPN often outperforms its closest competitor during the speed tests I perform every few months. It's one of the most popular VPN providers, offering a wide range of platforms, and is well-regarded and trusted. The service also has an expansive network with servers in 105 countries and has recently to include servers in every U.S. state. In total, eight simultaneous connections can be linked under a single account. I think this number of connections is restrictive, considering the higher price point of this VPN compared to many of its competitors. Compatible platforms include Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, Fire OS, and tvOS. The service also works with Linux, which has been with a GUI. Review: ExpressVPN: Is it worth the price? The company doesn't log your browsing history, IP address, or traffic destination and operates a no-logs policy. In ExpressVPN's latest transparency , the firm received 163 government, law enforcement, and civil requests for user data, one warrant, and over 800,000 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requests, but says no user information was handed over. While customer service is friendly and polite, they persist in customer retention, so you'll need to set aside some time if you wish to cancel after the 30-day period. Who it's for: Individuals who see speed as king. This VPN has consistently secured the top spot in my speed tests over the past few years. ExpressVPN is also the developer of Aircove, a router product line with ExpressVPN built in, saving you the legwork if you want blanket coverage for all your home devices. Alternatively, you can manually set up ExpressVPN to work with gaming consoles and TVs that do not natively support VPN apps, but you may need to install the VPN directly on your router. Who should look elsewhere: VPN customers who want a budget-friendly option should consider Surfshark or another of my recommended VPNs. Considering the high price point of the subscriptions, I would eventually like to see ExpressVPN support unlimited simultaneous connections instead of just eight. New users can subscribe to ExpressVPN's two-year plans for $4.99 per month with four months of free service added to the length of the contract. Alternatively, if you opt for $6.67 per month, you will receive one year of access with three months free. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee. ExpressVPN has also recently begun to accept Google Pay and Apple Pay.

Show less View now at Surfshark VPN Surfshark should be on your radar if you are looking for an affordable, secure VPN. Why we like it: In ZDNET's Surfshark VPN review and testing, we found this VPN offers reasonable speeds and a decent server network. I've also found that it's not the fastest option or the quickest to initially connect, but the cheap price point provides excellent value for money. There were also no data leaks, which is precisely what you want to see from a quality VPN. With 100 countries in its server network, you have plenty of locations to choose from, making this VPN a good choice for streaming content at home or abroad. Surfshark prioritizes security with AES-256-GCM, Perfect Forward Secrecy, and RSA-2048 encryption. The organization also upholds a no-logs policy, although this was last audited in 2023. Also: NordVPN vs Surfshark: Which is better? We like its add-on features, such as anti-tracking, a search engine that doesn't log your information, and a scanner that searches data breach lists for your email. With Surfshark's multi-hop option, you can also connect through two VPN servers. Customers praise the support team for being excellent and quick to respond. Who it's for: Anyone on the hunt for a consistently affordable VPN without any unwelcome price hikes. The cheapest option, a two-year subscription called Surfshark Starter, costs only $1.99 per month. Alternatively, you can sign up for one year and pay $3.19 per month or $15.45 for just one month of access. One- and two-year contracts include three months of free access and a 30-day money-back guarantee. Surfshark is now also through the MSI Rewards Program.

Why we like it: Private Internet Access is an excellent option if you need a VPN long-term and support for multiple devices. The service offers unlimited simultaneous connections, is compatible with various operating systems and devices, and also includes a free email breach monitor Review: Private Internet Access PIA's network isn't the largest, with only 91 country options available, but customers note that the VPN is quick to install and simple to use. However, my testing found that server upload speeds can be slow. Other features we like are the ""snooze"" button if you need to temporarily turn off the VPN and a tab displaying security elements including port connections, protocols, and data encryption standards in use. You can also opt for a dedicated IP address or an antivirus scanner as a part of your package. Who it's for: PIA offers excellent security, given that it's open source, and so security-conscious individuals should consider it. Much of the VPN's code can be examined and audited publicly, which is always desirable when trusting your security to a third-party vendor. A strict no-logs policy also exists, and PIA publishes frequent transparency reports. In its latest , PIA said it received seven subpoenas and a number of government requests, but no user logs were produced. Who should look elsewhere: If streaming, speed, or a large server network are more important than open source technologies, consider another option. If you would like to give it a try, Private Internet Access offers two plans, including a two-year subscription for $2.19 per month, making it a very affordable VPN. If you want to try out the VPN for a shorter period, you can sign up for $7.50 per month for six months. The best deal is the two-year subscription, as you also get two months of free access.

Show less View now at Proton VPN Proton is a Swiss company that adheres to the country's strict privacy laws and also provides a free VPN service. Why we like it: Under the slogan ""privacy by default,"" this organization is focused on developing services -- including encrypted email and a VPN -- to enhance the privacy of activists, journalists, and the public. Proton VPN takes a solid approach to security, layering robust protocols on top of perfect forward secrecy and encryption. Not only does Proton VPN have a kill switch, but it also provides torrenting support, WireGuard, and an ad-blocker. All of Proton's apps are open-source, there's a no-logs policy, and the company reports that it is independently audited. The firm has also created its own protocol, , which has been designed to circumvent censorship blocks. Among its other services is the NetShield ad-blocker, which has been recently to block more phishing domains. Proton VPN has also refined its mobile apps to reduce battery consumption. Customers like Proton's attitude to security and privacy. I find it easy to use, and the speeds are reasonable. Although Trustpilot ratings are low, the feedback primarily relates to the firm's free plan limits and customer support system. There are free and paid options available, and if you need a free solution, this is one of the few trusted VPNs I recommend. Review: Proton VPN Who it's for: Proton offers a free VPN service that is supported by paid users. It allows one machine to connect without bandwidth limits and provides access to servers across five countries. I don't typically recommend using free VPNs, but if you want a service for casual browsing, you should consider this one. Unlike many less reputable free VPN services, it will not sell your information -- but considering there are server and location restrictions for free accounts, you may not experience the true speeds of the overall network. Who should look elsewhere: Anyone who wants more than a restricted, albeit free, service should consider another option or check out Proton VPN's paid offerings. If you want access to Proton VPN's full server network of 117 countries and over servers, you will need to opt for a paid plan. The best deal is $3.59 per month on a two-year plan. A one-year plan is priced at $3.99 per month, or you can opt for one month of access for $10. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee.

How do I test the best VPNs? I ran a series of speed and connectivity tests in July 2025 on each VPN's paid service to see how they compare. I performed the tests using a broadband connection in the U.K. with an average starting speed, without a VPN, of 59.3 Mbps download and 17.2 Mbps upload. (Yes, they are terrible, but they are the best the U.K. currently offers where I live.) I also tested for the presence of domain name service (DNS) leaks. Please remember that results may differ for you and vary from country to country, so the below should be considered a snapshot. Your internet service provider (ISP) and broadband subscription may also impact your speeds. For example, the starting speed is a snail's pace compared to some U.S. offerings. The below results are not the exact speeds you should expect. You can instead use these results to get a general idea of how your speeds could change with a VPN. Remember that the further away the VPN server, the more your speed may be impacted. Speeds will typically be quicker when you connect to a local server, compared to selecting Australia, for example, unless you're in Australia. Show more

Which is the right VPN for you? Choose this top VPN service... If you want... NordVPN The best VPN overall. NordVPN is one of the most consistently fast and stable VPN providers with a solid and large server network, giving you plenty of countries to connect to. It's great for streaming and travel, too, with a stylish user interface on PC and mobile. ExpressVPN One of the fastest VPNs with a large server network. I've used ExpressVPN for years, and I consider it one of the fastest and least obtrusive services available. You can expect multi-platform support and relatively minor speed downgrades when you are streaming. However, it isn't cheap. Surfshark VPN The least expensive top VPN based on my testing. Surfshark is a consistent entrant in my top VPN lists, and for good reason. It might not always be the fastest, but for the price point, you can't argue against its value for money. It's also perfect for beginners. Private Internet Access Unlimited simultaneous connections. Private Internet Access is a great choice if you want a set-and-forget, affordable VPN, but the interface won't suit everyone. Still, this VPN will support and protect as many devices as you like under one account, including your PC, smartphone, and even your smart TV. Proton VPN A variety of add-on features and the comfort of open-source security. Proton VPN is one of the most privacy-focused VPN services out there. It offers reasonable speeds and is one of the few trusted providers out there that also provides users with a free plan. Show more

Factors to consider when choosing a VPN service These are the most important factors to consider when selecting a new VPN service. Speed: Every VPN performs differently, and every user experience differs. Your ISP will offer speeds that are not the same as someone in another location. Your favorite coffee shop has a different network connection than our local haunts. So, when you are testing a new VPN, keep your base speed in mind. Look out for VPN solutions with minimal speed loss.

Your favorite coffee shop has a different network connection than our local haunts. So, when you are testing a new VPN, keep your base speed in mind. Look out for VPN solutions with minimal speed loss. Apps : VPN providers should offer compatibility for multiple platforms and operating systems. Take a look at the user interfaces, features, and compatibility offered by your chosen VPN provider before you commit.

: VPN providers should offer compatibility for multiple platforms and operating systems. Take a look at the user interfaces, features, and compatibility offered by your chosen VPN provider before you commit. Simultaneous connections : If you're paying for a VPN, you might want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC, smartphone, or smart TV. We recommend you sign up for a plan supporting at least six devices, and thankfully, most paid plans now offer at least this number.

Trial periods: Before committing to a VPN provider, test them out -- that's what money-back guarantees are for. Remember that most VPN providers will give you 30 days to cancel and secure a refund. Some even offer up to 45 days.

Some even offer up to 45 days. Free VPN providers: Running a VPN is expensive, and if the VPN provider doesn't make money from your service fees, they're going to make money from your data -- sometimes even by selling your personal information.

Running a VPN is expensive, and if the VPN provider doesn't make money from your service fees, they're going to make money from your data -- sometimes even by selling your personal information. Stick with the trusted commercial vendors we've tested or the handful of free plans we recommend. There are also cases where ""free"" VPNs undermine what the software is designed for -- data protection and security. Contract terms : VPN providers constantly offer discounts, typically on longer-term plans, so you need to consider the fine print before you sign up. Remember to cancel before automatic renewal if you're no longer happy with the service or want to switch to a cheaper deal elsewhere.

Remember to cancel before automatic renewal if you're no longer happy with the service or want to switch to a cheaper deal elsewhere. Use cases : Your VPN selection should relate to how you want to use a VPN. For example, you may want one specifically for streaming geo-locked content, or you may need a VPN that is likely to work in restricted countries. Consider these points before making your final choice and test them out during your money-back-guarantee time period to ensure the VPN is right for you.

How to use a VPN

Charlie Osborne | ZDNET

If you're interested in using a VPN, setting up the service will depend on the VPN provider, your contract, and the devices you want to protect. To set up a VPN, you will first need to subscribe to a VPN service and download the VPN software. You can visit the VPN service's official website, or you may receive a download link through email. Alternatively, visit Google Play or the App Store for mobile app options.

Open the software, provide any associated permissions the VPN needs, and sign in using your credentials.

ZDNET | Charlie Osborne

Choose a server location and connect to the VPN. In this example, you can select ExpressVPN's ""..."" button to select a server from its list of countries. Most VPNs will give you a ""smart"" location set as default, typically close to home.

Also: Best VPNs for Smart TVs

It's that simple! Of course, you can check out your VPN's settings and tailor your experience to your liking. However, for many users, sticking to default options and having a few favorite servers will be enough.

How I test VPNs I tested and analyzed the best VPNs in 2025 using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision: Performance: My top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags. I frequently conduct speed tests to stay up to date and informed of any service changes.



My top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags. I frequently conduct speed tests to stay up to date and informed of any service changes. Simultaneous connections : Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV, and want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least six simultaneous connections.

Security : A VPN's security protocols and encryption levels must stay up to scratch. I want a recommended VPN's development team to prioritize security improvements over time and promptly address reported bugs, and I look for evidence of transparency around security updates.

Kill switch : A kill switch prevents you from using an unprotected connection. This is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop. All of my recommended VPNs provide this feature.

I ensured that our top recommendations perform well given these factors and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you are streaming.

Latest information on VPNs in 2025

The latest news Here are some of the recent headlines and most notable news stories in the VPN industry: BulletVPN has closed its doors, leaving some lifetime subscribers out in the cold. Windscribe has stepped in to offer some users a complimentary six-month subscription.

A free 'VPN' hosted on GitHub has been unmasked as information-stealing malware.

Roskomnadzor, Russia's federal media agency and regulator, has sent a wave of VPN takedown requests to Google in an apparent effort to wage war against VPN use in the country.

VPNs have formally been deemed a ""key challenge"" to investigative work and law enforcement agencies by the EU's HLG (High Level Group).

Windscribe founder Yegor Sak has been acquitted after a two-year legal battle in which he was personally charged in connection with ""an alleged internet offence by an unknown user of the service.""

Legacy VPN Secure customers have been told their lifetime access won't be honored, according to reports. The decision comes following an acquisition of the VPN provider's assets. Show more

Is VPN software impacted by tariffs? Recent tariff changes have not directly impacted Virtual Private Network software. Software is rarely considered in tariff alterations, and so subscription services should be safe, for now. However, this doesn't mean the industry as a whole will not be impacted, as associated hardware -- such as servers and networking equipment -- could be subject to higher costs. The White House has imposed temporary exemptions for electronics, but this could change at any time. Show more

A virtual private network (VPN) can keep your data safe, mask your IP address online, and provide you with protection while you're away from home. Trusted VPNs encrypt and route your traffic through dedicated networks, and you should always consider using one when you travel to avoid cyberthreats.

VPNs can also circumvent censorship blocks in the country you visit, including the UK's new age verification laws, and may help you access streaming services.

What is the best travel VPN right now?

My pick for the best travel VPN overall is NordVPN due to its robust security, speed, and fast and reliable connections. This VPN is also a great performer in my tests when it comes to unblocking streaming services and provides a vast server network, giving you plenty of choice as to where you want to be ""located"" while you are online. Two-year plans begin at $3.39 per month.

Alternatively, if you're willing to spend a little more at $5 per month, opt for ExpressVPN, one of the top performers in terms of speed in my experience. If you don't mind trading some speed for affordability, Surfshark is your best bet at only $2 per month.

The company is also behind , a protocol designed for users facing VPN server connection issues due to restrictive network policies, and in a new service update, NordVPN has spam call protection for Android users. Review: NordVPN NordVPN supports all major platforms and has Firefox, Edge, and Chrome browser plugins.

Overall, NordVPN is one of the best VPNs. The server network includes 111 countries, offering you a wide range of location options to choose from.

Show less View now at ExpressVPN ExpressVPN is a speedy, widely used VPN provider that supports many platforms and devices, making it one of my favorite VPN services for travel. Why we like it: It's not only one of the quickest VPNs on the market with minimal speed loss, but it's also one of the best VPNs for iPhones and a top VPN for Android, making it useful for traveling, especially when using multiple devices with different operating systems. The VPN's mobile app is easy to use, and I like the service's set-and-forget secure connectivity for your smartphone or tablet. Review: ExpressVPN ExpressVPN has a sizable server network across 105 countries, so no matter where you are, you'll likely be able to connect to a local server. The network has recently been upgraded to include servers in all 50 U.S. states. Its apps are compatible with operating systems including Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, and its Linux option has been updated recently to include -- a feature long requested by users. Its Windows app has also been following an RDP security tip. A downside is that the number of simultaneous devices you're permitted depends on your plan. The maximum is eight. Given the price point, I think this should be unlimited. ExpressVPN's clearly outlines what information it collects. It doesn't log data that could be used to identify you, such as your IP address, browsing history, or domain name system (DNS) queries. In ExpressVPN's latest transparency , the firm disclosed 163 government, law enforcement, and civil requests for user data, one warrant, and over 800,000 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) requests. The company said no user information was handed over. Who it's for: Individuals who want the least speed loss while using a travel VPN. Over the past few years, my tests have consistently found that ExpressVPN, together with NordVPN, performs the best in terms of speed. During long-term usage, I found that ExpressVPN offers some of the best overall speeds and stable connectivity. On rare occasions, you may need to switch servers as speeds suddenly drop, or you may encounter a website blocking your borrowed IP address -- but this is a rare occurrence and one I have also experienced with other VPNs. Customers said this VPN is pricey, but it provides good value for money, as well as solid customer support. Who should look elsewhere: Anyone who considers $4.99 per month for a VPN as too much, as there are many other more affordable VPNs on the market today, such as NordVPN and Surfshark. Two-year contracts are priced at $5 per month, with four months of free access added to the subscription term. One-year plans cost $6.67 per month with three months free. ExpressVPN accepts Google Pay and Apple Pay as payment options alongside payment cards and provides a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Show less View now at Surfshark VPN Surfshark is an excellent option if you need a budget-friendly VPN for your trips abroad. Why we like it: Speeds are reasonable, especially when you consider the price point. They can be slower than competitors, but not to a drastic degree. This is also a beginner-friendly VPN with a clean and easy-to-understand user interface. That said, my tests have found that initial server connections can be slow. Review: Surfshark VPN I particularly like the option to disconnect or pause your VPN for five minutes, 30 minutes, or two hours. You can also select a server from 100 countries. Surfshark VPN offers many features, including split tunneling, a kill switch to keep your connection secure if it drops, double VPN MultiHop, static and rotating IP addresses, and an ad-blocker. There are also inexpensive add-ons, including a tracker-free search engine, a data breach scanner, and an antivirus. In May, Surfshark also the launch of new domain name service (DNS) servers to provide users with additional anonymity and potentially improve connection times. Who it's for: Individuals who want an affordable, secure VPN. The company doesn't log your activity while you use the service and offers private DNS capabilities, which Surfshark calls mode. This feature lets you access sites regardless of restrictive border connections. Be careful -- countries that limit access tend to frown upon attempts to bypass those restrictions. Surfshark subscriptions start at $2 per month for a two-year plan and $3.19 per month for a one-year plan. One- and two-year plans give customers three months of free access, which is added to the length of the contract. Surshark is also now through the MSI Rewards Program. Alternatively, you can sign up for one month for $15.45. I don't recommend this, though -- instead, take advantage of Surfshark's 30-day money-back guarantee. Customers applaud Surfshark's customer service, but some have noted billing issues. Who should look elsewhere? If you want the best and largest server networks available when you travel, opt for one of my other VPN recommendations, some of which boast broader networks.

Show less View now at Proton VPN Proton VPN, which is currently enjoying a new surge of popularity in the UK thanks to new online age verification systems imposed by the government, is my top choice for a free VPN able to help you avoid censorship. Why we like it: Swiss company Proton utilizes the slogan ""privacy by default."" It is focused on developing privacy-enhancing products for the general public, activists, journalists, and anyone who wants to circumvent censorship imposed in their home countries. Proton VPN takes security seriously, and all of its apps are open source, allowing anyone to examine its code for potential privacy flaws or security vulnerabilities. Review: Proton VPN Its VPN is one such product that provides users with up to 10 simultaneous connections, unless you're taking advantage of the free plan, in which you are limited to one device. The Proton VPN server network spans 117 countries, boasting over servers. It offers peer-to-peer (P2P) and torrenting capabilities, as well as streaming support and an ad blocker. I've found the speeds to be reasonable, based on my frequent speed and stability tests. You can route your traffic through the Tor network for enhanced privacy or use WireGuard if you prefer. Proton VPN operates a no-logs policy and is independently audited. Among its other services is the NetShield ad blocker, which has been recently to block more phishing domains. Proton VPN has also refined its mobile apps to reduce battery consumption. Proton's attitude to security and privacy is popular with customers. Proton also offers a free VPN service that is supported by paying users. Trustpilot ratings are low, but the feedback primarily relates to the firm's free plan limits. Who it's for: Individuals looking for a travel-friendly VPN might find its new protocol, , an interesting addition. Stealth was designed to circumvent censorship by bypassing some firewalls and VPN blocking methods, such as blocking connections suspected of being VPN traffic. It's also a great option as a free travel VPN. ""Traditional VPN protocols (such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, and WireGuard) are relatively easy to recognize on a network,"" Proton VPN says. ""And as deep packet inspection (DPI) technology becomes more widespread, it will be easier and easier for authoritarian governments to detect and block VPNs using these protocols."" Who should look elsewhere: If speed is your top priority for streaming and gaming while you're away from home, Proton VPN might not be the right fit. Instead, consider ExpressVPN or NordVPN. Still, if Proton VPN is right for you, the best deal is $3.59 per month on a two-year plan. A one-year plan is priced at $4 per month, or you can opt for one month of access for $10. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee.

Stealth was designed to circumvent censorship by bypassing some firewalls and VPN blocking methods, such as blocking connections suspected of being VPN traffic. It's also a great option as a free travel VPN. ""Traditional VPN protocols (such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, and WireGuard) are relatively easy to recognize on a network,"" Proton VPN says. ""And as deep packet inspection (DPI) technology becomes more widespread, it will be easier and easier for authoritarian governments to detect and block VPNs using these protocols."" Who should look elsewhere: If speed is your top priority for streaming and gaming while you're away from home, Proton VPN might not be the right fit. Instead, consider ExpressVPN or NordVPN. Still, if Proton VPN is right for you, the best deal is $3.59 per month on a two-year plan. A one-year plan is priced at $4 per month, or you can opt for one month of access for $10.

What is a travel VPN service, and why should you use one? A travel VPN service is a virtual private network best suited for when you leave your home country. This means it will provide you with a server network spanning multiple countries, cities, and towns, allowing you to shift your 'location' to somewhere else entirely -- bypassing internet censorship, geo-restrictions, and potentially even allowing you to access different streaming content libraries by region. Also: Best VPNs for streaming 2025: I've tested Netflix libraries worldwide so you don't have to Furthermore, a travel-ready VPN should be compatible with a variety of operating systems and devices, and it should implement strong encryption and other security measures to protect your privacy. When traveling, consider using a VPN to keep your data safe, especially if you're using unknown or public -- and untrustworthy -- internet connections. Show more

How to use a VPN when you travel

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

To set up a travel VPN, subscribe to a service and download the software for your device. Open the program and sign in using your credentials. Choose a server location and connect to the VPN.

Charlie Osborne/ZDNET

Once connected, your internet traffic should be encrypted, and your IP address should be hidden.

Remember, you can use a VPN on different devices, including your laptop and smartphone. While you are traveling, you should enable your VPN for any online activities, regardless of whether you are using a hotel connection or a public Wi-Fi hotspot. You will always be better protected by using your cellular plan if it's available and not too expensive.

Factors to consider when choosing a travel VPN While travel-friendly VPNs can be used anytime, there are specific features that make them the strongest contenders on my travel VPN recommendations list. When you are deciding on the most suitable travel VPN, consider the following factors: Price : VPN prices vary, and although the most expensive services can cost you upwards of $10 to $20 per month, you can also find solid, reliable VPNs for as little as a few dollars per month. That said, you may be interested in paying top rates if you want additional features, such as a password manager or reliable connections in countries such as China.

That said, you may be interested in paying top rates if you want additional features, such as a password manager or reliable connections in countries such as China. Trial length : You need to consider how long you think you will need a VPN. If you're in it for the long haul, consider a two-year subscription -- as you also tend to get the best monthly prices on the longest terms. Some VPNs will offer more extended options, but if you're only traveling for a month, you might be willing to pay a little extra so that you are not tied to a longer contract.

How I test VPNs Many providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by ZDNET's team. We've been talking about VPNs for years, spoken with their management and users, and developed a generally favorable impression. I have tested and analyzed the best VPNs for travel in 2025 using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision: Performance: My top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance, especially while you're in different countries. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags.

Latest news on VPNs in 2025

Here are some of the recent and notable news stories in the VPN sector:

VPN downloads have surged

A free ""VPN"" hosted on GitHub has been unmasked

A new study

Russia's federal regulator for media and communications, Roskomnadzor, is trying to wipe out the existence of VPN apps in the Google Play Store. So far, 212 VPNs

Windscribe founder Yegor Sak has been acquitted

Is VPN software impacted by tariff changes? Software, including VPNs, is not usually directly impacted by tariffs. However, software does require a physical infrastructure, and the equipment required to run a VPN network, like servers, may become more expensive or difficult to acquire. In turn, this may lead to higher pricing in the future. While VPN software is not in the firing line yet, the White House's original tariff announcement became a catalyst for stock market fluctuations and the panic-buying of some consumer goods. A temporary stay of execution for tariffs on electronics is currently in place. Show more

Travel VPN FAQs What is a VPN? A VPN is a virtual private network that allows you to browse the internet privately and securely, including when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks. VPNs allow you to change your virtual location by redirecting the connection through servers around the world. A VPN can also encrypt your traffic, keeping your online activities hidden from prying eyes. If your online activities are monitored at the internet service provider (ISP) level -- say, by a government -- the snoopers may recognize your VPN's ""signature."" While they can't see the details of what you're doing, they will know that you're using a VPN. VPNs can also be useful in unblocking geo-restricted content and can be a vital tool for accessing information in countries with repressive governments. They are essential services for anyone who wants to maintain their security and privacy online. Show more Will a travel VPN slow down my internet speed? A VPN might slow your internet speed if the data is encrypted and decrypted before transmission. A good travel VPN should have a minimal impact on your speed, and the added security is worth the slight speed loss. If you use a public hotspot or hotel connection while you're away, your speed will likely be slow at the source and not as fast as you are used to at home. Show more What should I do if I experience traffic slowdowns with a VPN? If you experience traffic slowdowns, check the VPN and Wi-Fi connection between your device, router, or access point. Sometimes, connectivity issues begin at the source, and in other cases, switching your selected VPN server may be enough to resolve speed problems or connectivity drops. Keep in mind that if you are on the road, and you are relying on a free hotspot or hotel connection, your base speed may be lower and might not meet the standards of your home connection. Show more Are travel VPNs legal? Using a VPN is legal in most countries, but some exceptions exist. Some countries such as China, Russia, and Iran, restrict VPN usage or have banned them entirely. It's essential to research the local laws of the country you're traveling to before using a VPN. Show more How can I find out what the VPN rules are for the countries I'm visiting? There are several good sources. Reaching out to your VPN vendor is always a good idea. They often have a good feel for the countries in which their services operate and will frequently post guidance on their websites. If you're a U.S. citizen, consider using U.S. State Department resources. The department lists travel advisories for U.S. citizens and has foreign service officials who can provide general guidance. Check the travel advisories webpage. Your nation's foreign ministry may have a similar service if you're outside the US. If you're trying to understand which countries ban or discourage VPN usage, NordVPN has a legal guide that lists countries with severe restrictions, bans, and possible penalties for breaking VPN laws. Show more Is a VPN all I need to be protected online while traveling? No. VPNs can generally protect your data while it's in motion. If your computer or phone is seized, however, it's possible law enforcement can access your data, even if it's encrypted. Some governments might hold your devices without giving you a reason. Online services you access in another country might also have less protection than those in your host country. Also: Best antivirus for Windows of 2025 Show more What is a DNS leak, and why does it matter? A domain name service (DNS) leak is the exposure of your information -- such as DNS queries -- outside of secure, encrypted tunnels when you are using a VPN. If your activity is exposed, this compromises the whole point of using a virtual private network in the first place. As you can imagine, you don't want to use a travel VPN known for DNS leaks. Most reputable VPNs will prevent DNS leaks, but if you can, use an online service like DNS leak test to check your connection. Show more If my hotel has a wired connection, do I still need to use a VPN? Yes. Don't assume network endpoints are safe when you're traveling. Always make sure your connections are encrypted when communicating from any network connection. Show more Can a VPN help me save on airfare? Many VPN services claim you can save hundreds of dollars on flights by changing your location. Plenty of blog posts with anecdotal evidence support the theory that a VPN can help cut the price of your plane ticket. The reality is less clear, and the most likely scenario is that no one knows how much -- if at all -- a VPN can help you score cheap flights. Airfare prices are set by algorithms based on complicated factors, such as changing demand. You could notice a price difference using a VPN to spoof your location, but the change in cost may or may not be related to your location. Practically, it isn't easy to account for every possible variable. Also, given the amount of data available to consumers, the real advantage of using a VPN may be that it remains anonymous. Another way to look at it is if a VPN reduces the cost of airfare, it's most likely not going to have as big of an impact as other factors. There are different tactics for booking cheap flights that should be higher on your priority list. Booking early, keeping an eye out for price drops, check if there are change fees before booking, or traveling during days or times of day when there is less demand are great ways to secure the best possible flight prices. Show more Can a VPN make it look like I am in another country? Yes. You can choose your home country as a default location, but if you would prefer to have an IP assigned from a different country -- the U.S. rather than the U.K., for example -- you should be able to do so. The available locations vary depending on the VPN you are using. Show more Can I access my streaming service abroad? If you're a paid subscriber to a streaming service, such as Netflix, Disney+, or Amazon Prime Video, you can often access your streaming service while you're away from home. You can use a VPN to change your IP address to another point of origin -- and if this is set to your home location, you should have access to your library. Using a VPN to access other libraries may go against your terms of service and the streaming platform's licensing agreements, so keep this in mind. Also: Best VPN for Fire TV Stick Show more Does a VPN incur roaming charges? No. A VPN network can help you simulate and appear from a location abroad, but this doesn't mean you'll face roaming charges imposed by your carrier. Unfortunately, a VPN will also not allow you to avoid roaming charges while you're away from home. Show more Should I use a VPN in my home country? Absolutely. You should consider using a VPN in your home country and abroad, as in both cases, you are still offered online protection, encrypted communication, and privacy tools. As long as VPN usage is legal, a VPN can be invaluable. Show more Do I pay for a VPN month by month? VPN providers usually market their pricing on a month-to-month basis. However, you usually pay for your chosen contract upfront when you purchase. For example, a VPN available for $3 per month will likely equate to $36 upfront on a yearly contract -- plus tax. An exception is Mullvad, which offers a month-by-month €5 -- or about $5.31 -- price, no matter how long you want to use the VPN for. You tend to enjoy the best discounts on VPN contracts when you sign up for longer terms. Two years is usually the longest term you can sign up for, although some VPN providers offer five-year subscriptions. Show more Why are VPN one-month plans so expensive? The simple answer is that VPN providers do not want users to pop in and out with four-week subscriptions. Instead, they hope to lure consumers with cheap one-year and two-year plans and will display the monthly equivalent price in marketing materials rather than the upfront payment. If you are interested in a VPN but don't want to pay upwards of $20 to try it out, we recommend you sign up for a longer term and take advantage of money-back guarantees. These refund windows are typically available for the first 30 days, although CyberGhost offers 45 days. You can then cancel before the end of this period. Show more

365,zdnet.com,https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-headphones-for-sleeping/,The best sleep headphones of 2025: Expert tested,,"Why we like them

The Ozlo Sleepbuds are impressively effective at their job: getting you to bed. Once the Sleepbuds are in your ears, they produce noise-masking (not noise-canceling) white noise that's dialed at the perfect volume to reduce external distractions and help you quickly fall asleep (and you don't even need to connect them with a phone or the app for this to work). My bedroom overlooks a bustling Brooklyn street that is always polluted with noise, like police sirens, screaming ambulances, neighbors singing and celebrating into the wee hours of the night, and pedestrians yelling at each other. These earbuds simplified my descent into sleep -- I put these earbuds in and couldn't hear a song or chatter outside my window.

If you download the app, you can customize your sleep sounds with up to 10 to choose from, set up an alarm in the earbuds, and put a timer on the earbuds for them to shut down after you've gone to bed. Some features, like sleep tracking, will also be coming soon in an over-the-air app update.

As far as comfort goes, you won't find a sleep earbud that's more comfortable to sleep in. This is thanks to the stabilizing ear wings that keep the buds in place without additional pressure buildup (that tends to cause soreness and sensitivity). I'm a side sleeper and found these the most comfortable to wear as I turned from one side of my head to the other. In my review, I write that they dissolved into my ears, becoming nearly invisible as I fell asleep, which is all that you really want out of a sleep earbud.

Who should buy them

Of course, $300 is still a pretty penny to pay for a decent night of uninterrupted sleep. But the Ozlo Sleepbuds are the best earbuds for a reason: they have a thoughtful design, are an effective sound-masking technology, and are a comfortable fit that makes me want to wear them every night.

If I could describe the Ozlo Sleepbuds' perfect customer, it would be someone who has a noisy partner or bedroom conditions that prevent them from easily falling asleep. They have some money to spend on the finest sleep earbuds on the market. Maybe they're a side sleeper and are seeking out a sleep earbud that will feel comfortable as they lie on their side.

Who should look elsewhere

If $350 is too much to spend right now, I'd suggest the Anker A20 sleep earbuds, which also produce noise-masking soundscapes and offer a flat, comfortable fit, but are half the price.

364,zdnet.com,https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-smart-ring/,The best smart rings of 2025: I tested and found an obvious winner,,"At this point in the smart ring race, everyone is trying to beat Oura. But the Oura Ring 4 proves that the smart ring pioneer's position isn't wavering anytime soon. While most smart rings simply provide you with collected health data, the Oura Ring 4 tells you the story and the context behind that data for greater information on your health.

Why we like it: What separates the Oura Ring 4 from its competition is its commitment to helpful and actionable health insights that can change or encourage healthy behaviors. As someone who has used the Oura Ring 3 and Oura Ring 4 for over a year, I can attest to the smart ring's health and sleep data illustrations and recommendations that have changed my habits for the better. It doesn't just tell me my sleep or readiness score - it tells me why I got a poor sleep score by showing a graph of when my heart rate dropped that night, and how that drop in heart rate led to a low or high score. Then, it explains how factors like alcohol, exercise, or meal timing influence sleep timing, and thus, sleep and readiness scores.

The Oura Ring app's data illustrations provide the right amount of information about my night's sleep, yesterday's activities, and overall stress patterns - and supplement this daily data with long-term trends that can paint a fuller picture of my overall health. Still, the data rarely feels overwhelming, and even on nights when I've gone to bed too late or on days when I'm inactive, the smart ring's nudges and summaries never skew demanding or judgmental.

Who's it for: Unlike other smart rings that focus on day-to-day health, the Oura Ring is for people who want to assess both their short-term and long-term overall health. This could be someone managing a health condition or an aging person who wants to detect early signs of strain. For example, its daytime stress data that it collects translates into a long-term resilience status that illustrates how quickly an Oura wearer bounces back from high stress. Through its daily activity information it monitors, you can learn about your long-term cardio capacity and cardiovascular age to get a sense of general heart health.

Oura's smart ring (and subsequent monthly subscription) tends to cost more than its competitors because of the constant research and product development, as well as the features that go beyond daily monitoring. So the smart ring will also be best for people who are willing to pay that expensive starting price of $350 (plus the $72 annual subscription).

If I could paint the Oura Ring's ideal customer, it would be one who is willing to splurge on a sleep and health-tracking device to regularly check their health data and who is looking for data-driven suggestions and innovative features to improve their overall wellness. It's also got the smallest and largest ring sizes out of all the smart rings on this list, so if a customer hasn't found the right fit in other smart rings, they will probably find a good fit with the Oura Ring.

Who should look elsewhere: I'd recommend the Ultrahuman Ring Air if you want similarly innovative health features without the added subscription cost. If you don't need innovative health features to understand your long-term health and just want to check your sleep and readiness score, I'd recommend the Galaxy Ring, which costs a similar price of $350, or the RingConn Gen 2 Air, which costs $200, the cheapest price on this list.

That's the beauty of the current landscape, which spans from the best foldable phones, like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, that challenge the status quo, to cheap phones, like the CMF Phone 2 Pro and Google Pixel 9a, that cater to consumers on a budget. Just this month, Samsung kicked off hot foldable summer with two new releases, and I expect other phone makers to follow suit in 2025.

Of all the top handsets we've tried and tested at ZDNET, the best Android phones offer a robust hardware-software package with just enough innovation to keep the user excited.

What is the best Android phone right now?

I thoroughly test every Android phone that makes its way onto my desk, spending at least two weeks (and up to months) with each device before deciding whether it fits within ZDNET's buying guide. My pick for the best Android phone overall is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for $1,299, which features the company's flagship features and capabilities, including an S Pen stylus for precision inputs, AI features for productivity and creativity, a 200MP camera system, and the most durable display on any Galaxy phone yet.

The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is another frontrunner for its sheer value. It sells for $459 yet offers premium features like a 120Hz OLED display, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, and capable cameras backed by a new telephoto lens.

Best Android phones in 2025

Show less View now at Amazon View now at Samsung Why we like it: The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best handset of all the Android phones we've tested. The new Galaxy AI embedded in the device brings a slew of generative AI capabilities, including real-time phone call translations, multi-app AI voice prompts, enhanced photo editing, and a new AI Select tool that offers contextual shortcuts based on what you hover over. Notably, I've found that most of these features outperform AI tools offered by competing Android phones regarding speed, reliability, and practicality. Like its predecessor, the S24 Ultra, the S25 Ultra is built with a large 6.9-inch AMOLED and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. It helps that the S25 Ultra is made of a lightweight yet durable titanium frame and features Corning's Gorilla Armor 2, which is ideal for users who worry about damaging or scuffing up their devices. Under the hood, the S25 Ultra includes an upgraded Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset for improved graphics and AI features and 12GB of RAM. From our testing, the Qualcomm processor not only yields greater day-to-day performance but also improved power efficiency for longer endurance (roughly nine hours of typical use per charge). Lastly, the big upgrade for the new camera system is a 50MP ultrawide lens that produces greater detail and vividness when capturing landscape and macro shots. Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Who it's for: Although the price of the S25 Ultra is still fairly inaccessible at $1,299, the phone's upgrades make it well worth it for users holding onto three to four-year-old devices, and are looking to switch to something more capable. The S25 Ultra retains last year's anti-reflection screen which, when paired with the larger cooling chamber, makes it a fantastic multimedia device and easy to use when outdoors. If money is no object, or you score a competitive offer from your local carrier or retailer, then the S25 Ultra is the best phone you can buy today. Who should look elsewhere: With the S25 Ultra, you'll have to live with the fact that the S Pen no longer supports Bluetooth gestures, which previously allowed users to snap with a click of the stylus key. And if you're tight on budget or not a fan of the Ultra model's boxier footprint, I'd recommend a lower-tier S25 model or check out the OnePlus 13. Both options offer similar features but for less money.

Show less View now at Amazon View now at Samsung View now at Best Buy Why we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best foldable phone going into the rest of 2025, thanks to its ultra-thin form factor and market-leading camera system, which captures more lifelike images than competing models from OnePlus and Google, based on our tests. Samsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches. Naturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the ""inferior"" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature. Review: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Who it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr. This ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this. Who should look elsewhere: With a starting price tag of $1,999, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead. Users shopping for a foldable phone should consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 6.5-inch exterior and 8-inch interior | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto | Front cameras: 10MP front | Battery: 4,400mAh | Price: Starting at $1,999 Value 6 Performance 9 Battery life 8 Camera quality 9 Display 9 Pros Lighter (215 grams) and thinner design is very practical to use

Compared to the latest Google Pixel 9a and Apple iPhone 16e, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro fields a transparent glass backing that's decorated with screws and data ribbons underneath. This is all accented with the brand's popular Glyph interface, an array of LEDs that shine and sparkle depending on incoming notifications, calls, timers, and more. It's a hardware package that makes other midrange phones look outdated and should appeal to fashion-forward users or folks who value innovation above all else. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is rather competitive in specs, too, with a 6.77-inch 120Hz display that's larger and brighter (up to 3,000 nits) than its closest competitors. While it's only a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset powering the system -- meaning it won't breeze past Fortnite runs at max graphics -- I've found the processor good enough for daily browsing, social media consumption, and streaming movies. Review: Nothing Phone 3a Pro Who it's for: If bang for your buck is what you're after, consider the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. It's a great-value handset that's designed to appeal to tech enthusiasts, trailblazers, and fashion-forward consumers. It also has a rather minimal software experience that will please users looking for a bloatware-free interface. Still, there's just enough easter eggs across widgets, settings, and customization options to prevent you from getting bored. Who should look elsewhere: Of course, some limitations are expected from a phone in this price range, such as a less-capable camera system that can be inconsistent in contrast levels and color (e.g., making the sky appear muted or not having much depth between the subject and background). There's also no wireless charging support, a typical omission in this price range but still an annoyance for users who have adopted the technology. If that's a feature you require, I'd recommend the Google Pixel 9a instead. The last thing to note is that the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is only available through the company's Beta Program, at least here in the US. It's free to join but requires you to sign up on its website to buy the phone, meaning the Phone 3a Pro is unavailable at your local retailer or carrier store. That may be a dealbreaker for some.

For $899, it's very difficult to find a better flagship phone deal right now. Putting the value aspect aside, the OnePlus 13 shines with its charging speed; it's something I've learned to not take for granted, as competing Android flagships tend to require hours longer to top up. From my tests, the phone's 80W wired charging can power it from 0% to 50% within 10 minutes, with a full charge taking less than 30 minutes. That's compared to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, for example, which takes more than an hour to fully charge with its 45W standard. OnePlus also includes the 80W charger in the box, a free bonus that will benefit users who don't want to spend any more on accessories and are always on the go. Another vantage point is the OnePlus 13's IP69 rating, which laps its predecessor, the OnePlus 12, in water resistance. By IP69 standards, the phone can withstand high-pressure, high-temperature water jets and humidity changes. In other words, leaving the device in a washer and dryer, or even dropping it in a pot of boiling soup, won't damage it. Review: OnePlus 13 Who it's for: The OnePlus 13 starts at $899, which is cheaper than its closest (current) competitors, the $999 Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus and Google Pixel 9 Pro. The price point alone makes it worthy of recommending to consumers looking for a flagship phone experience without needing to fork up $1,000 or more. For the money, you'll also get the fastest charging speeds on the US market, great for users who are always on the go or require as much power as possible in a given time. Who should look elsewhere: While the OnePlus 13 hits almost every mark from our testing, alternatives like the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus are more readily available at carrier stores and promise longer software support, both of which are ideal for users looking for a device they can hold onto for the next 5+ years. The OnePlus 13 also falls short when it comes to video-recording, with our tests exposing its inconsistent HDR capturing, color processing, and imperfect stabilization. Therefore, users who may lean heavier on video-recording should consider other flagship phones like the iPhone 16 Pro.

Show less View now at Amazon View now at Google Why we like it: When it comes to camera performance, I've been equally impressed with the output from the big three (Apple, Samsung, and Google). But more often than not, Google's Pixel camera system takes the cake, with the latest Pixel 9 Pro models outpacing the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro when it comes to shutter speed (to capture fast-moving subjects like cars and sports), post-processing, and color accuracy. Of course, real-time capturing is only half the battle with mobile photography; there's also post-processing and the flexibility of devices with editing and tweaking subjects. In that regard, the Pixel 9 Pro, powered by a Tensor G4 chipset, may just have the most flexible and creative photo toolbox on the market, with AI features like Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and Best Take that allow you to modify the pictures you capture to achieve the best (or most ideal) shot. Both the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL feature a reliable triple lens setup based on our tests, with a 50MP primary lens, a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens that's great for users looking to capture distant subjects like statues and buildings. They're backed by useful software features like Google's Super Res Zoom (for up to 30x zoom photos), 8K video upscaling, and a new Add Me feature that lets you snap and merge two photos -- useful for family photos and during times when you don't have a spare cameraman. Review: Google Pixel 9 Pro XL Who it's for: It certainly helps that the Google Pixel 9 Pro series, which includes the $899 Pro and $1,099 Pro XL, undercut Apple and Samsung's flagship phones. (That's not counting the occasional deals we've seen during major holiday and commerce events.) For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max costs $1,199, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra costs $1,299. Therefore, we recommend the Pixel to customers who are aggressively searching for a good phone deal. Users who prefer a less bloated software experience should also consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro series over its Android competitors like the Samsung Galaxy S25 and OnePlus 13, as Google's Pixel launcher is free of unnecessary third-party apps. The Google Pixel line is also among the first to receive the latest Android software features, an aspect that should appeal to enthusiasts and developers. Who should look elsewhere: While the Pixel 9 Pro series performs well for photo capturing, if you're looking for a phone camera that specializes more in video-capturing (especially with Pro modes), I'd recommend the iPhone 16 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, both of which have better image stabilization and motion-smoothening.

Costs $100 more than last year's model Google Pixel 9 Pro Best camera Android phone 4.1 / 5 Score Why we like it: When it comes to camera performance, I've been equally impressed with the output from the big three (Apple, Samsung, and Google). But more often than not, Google's Pixel camera system takes the cake, with the latest Pixel 9 Pro models outpacing the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro when it comes to shutter speed (to capture fast-moving subjects like cars and sports), post-processing, and color accuracy. Of course, real-time capturing is only half the battle with mobile photography; there's also post-processing and the flexibility of devices with editing and tweaking subjects. In that regard, the Pixel 9 Pro, powered by a Tensor G4 chipset, may just have the most flexible and creative photo toolbox on the market, with AI features like Magic Editor, Photo Unblur, and Best Take that allow you to modify the pictures you capture to achieve the best (or most ideal) shot.

I went hands-on with the new Razr Ultra model earlier this year, and was thoroughly impressed by the improved hinge system (read: the phone feels sturdier to flip open and close), as well as the performance, which is underpinned by an updated Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 12GB of RAM. Motorola's outer display still supports virtually any app you throw at it, meaning you can browse the web, play games, scroll TikTok, and do other mobile tasks without ever needing to flip open the device. Samsung's platform is more limited in this regard, which always felt like a missed opportunity when testing. It also helps that the Razr Ultra has a textured backing, including new Alcantara and Wood finishes, which I've found to be easier to hold and grip than competing flip phones. Considering how fragile these foldable devices can be -- anything with so many moving parts typically are -- the enhanced grip is easy to appreciate. Review: Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) Who it's for: At $1,299, the Razr Ultra is not a cheap flip phone by any means. That's why its more affordable siblings, the Razr and Razr Plus, exist. But if you want the most complete, durable, and visually-stimulating flip phone on the market right now, you'll have to pay to play with the Razr Ultra. I applauded Motorola for exploring new color and material finishes with this year's Razr, and that's something fashion-forward users will likely favor too. The battery on this year's model -- 4,700mAh, up from 4,000mAh -- is also much larger, which you can never really complain about. Who should look elsewhere: When buying the Razr Ultra, you should also consider aspects like Motorola's relatively short software update cadence, which ranges from 2 to 3 years, versus Google and Samsung's 7 years. If you're looking for a phone that's even more forgiving when dropped, I'd invest in a traditional slab handset instead, like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series or iPhone 16 Pro series.

Here's a rundown of its key gaming features: The phone has one of the smoothest 185Hz refresh rate displays I've tested (compared to the 120Hz and 144Hz configurations on competing models like the RedMagic 10 Pro), 16GB of RAM, a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset to power through games and background tasks, capacitive side triggers that are mappable to various in-game functions, an additional LED back panel that one Reddit user says is ""screaming my name,"" and a 5,800mAh battery keeping the lights turned on. It's a mouthful, I know. The latest model features various AI tools, like a wallpaper generator, to suit your theming preferences. For gamers, the phone supports X Sense, which uses AI to learn your in-game patterns so that the phone can automatically perform tasks for you, such as picking up objects as you move around in Genshin Impact.

The software is also rich with gaming-centric settings and customizations, ideal for gamers who like to tinker, but not for the everyday consumer who's just getting started. Who should look elsewhere: From my testing, the Asus ROG Phone 9 series falls short when it comes to camera performance and software experience -- both of which are common among gaming phones. With all the focus on rendering graphics and processing power, the 50MP camera on the ROG Phone can produce washed-out and over-sharpened photos, and therefore, I don't recommend it for users shopping for a reliable camera phone. For those reasons, I'd suggest either the OnePlus 13 or Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra to anyone who wants a handset that's less polarizing. Both of those models are more capable of handling day-to-day tasks -- on top of mobile gaming.

Which is the right Android phone for you? All of these phones run the same base operating system, but the user interfaces range from stock Android to more elaborate options. First, you need to figure out which best fits your needs. Camera performance across the board is solid for just about every phone on the list, but some are better than others. If you plan to capture photos as your primary function, you should look to Google, Samsung, or even OnePlus. If you plan to spend $1,000 or more, you may also want your phone to last at least a couple of years. You should consider companies with a good track record of regular updates, notably Google and Samsung, which currently promise seven years of software support. Choose this Android phone… If you want… Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra The overall best with nearly no compromises. Buy this phone if you want a device that delivers on display and camera quality, AI features, and battery life. It also comes with an S Pen stylus for precision inputs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 The best foldable phone on the market right now, whether you're based in the US or not. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is built with comfort in mind and features a much-desired 200MP main camera sensor. Google Pixel 9 Pro A clean and minimal software experience and several Google-exclusive perks, like Add Me and Video Boost, distinguish the Pixel 9 Pro from the rest of the competition. OnePlus 13 A phone that takes less than 30 minutes to completely top up, with other specifications that are just as capable. The best is its $899 starting price, which undercuts its flagship competitors. Nothing Phone 3a Pro Arguably the best sub-$500 phone on the market right now, with a design that distinguishes itself from competing mid-range handsets. Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro A high-performance package that comes with all the features necessary for an enjoyable gaming experience. That includes side triggers and a cooling fan add-on. Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) A compact phone that doesn't compromise on performance. It's rare to find such a combination, but that's exactly what you're getting with this clamshell foldable.

What is better, an iPhone or an Android? Customizability remains one of the biggest vantage points of Android, even though Apple has done a commendable job over the past two to three iOS versions to give its users more autonomy. You can also expect Android phones to support the most innovative features in the mobile industry, like foldable displays and faster USB-C charging. The caveat of being more experimental is that Android phones are generally not as consistent and reliable as iPhones. On the flip side, iPhones are notorious for their stability and ease of use. If you're not one to tinker with your gadgets, then you'll fit right into the iOS ecosystem. Features like iMessage and FaceTime are also key differentiators when comparing iPhones to Android. Those two features alone can dictate your decision. Show more

Kerry Wan's smartphone advice

I've used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset. Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone in 2025:

Speeding up your smartphone

Something I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access (but rules were meant to be broken, right?).

Also: Best phones for battery life: Great battery, even better performance

To turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times, and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From there, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from 1x (default) to 0.5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.

Optimizing your battery health

To preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn (or degrade) the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.

When in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.

How to keep your phone clean

Unless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Samsung Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at 1 meter deep.

FAQ on smartphones When do new phones come out? While the year just started, we can look at past industry trends to understand when new phones will be released. Below is a list of expected release dates/timeframe for major phones in 2025. Samsung Galaxy S25 series: January

OnePlus 13 series: January

Apple iPhone 16e: February

Google Pixel 9a: March

Motorola Razr Ultra: May

Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: May

Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7: July

Google Pixel 10 series: August

Apple iPhone 17 series: September Show more When is the Google Pixel 10 series expected to release? Google recently confirmed that its next ""Made by Google"" hardware event, which showcases the company's latest Pixel, Nest, and other products, will take place on August 20, 2025 in New York. At this summer's product event, we're expecting the company to debut the new Pixel 10 Series, featuring the standard Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold, alongside new Pixel Watches and earbuds. Show more What is the best brand for Android phones? The beauty of Android is that you have a lot of options. So the answer to ""Which brand is best?"" depends on your feature, user interface, and design preferences. If you prefer a more minimalistic approach to hardware and software, Google's Pixel line will serve you best. If you want everything but the kitchen sink in a smartphone, go with Samsung. For more unique value propositions like ultra-fast charging and a smooth interface, give OnePlus phones a try. Budget is also worth considering, but today, every major manufacturer, including Google and Samsung, offers Android phones in every price category (budget, mid-range, and premium) so it won't be your biggest decider. Show more What is the most reliable smartphone brand? In the grand scheme, Apple is the most reliable smartphone brand, with the longest, most consistent support of all manufacturers. If we're looking at Android makers only, then Samsung would take the crown, with a promise of up to seven years of software updates for its latest phones, expansive carrier support across the US (and overseas), and one of the most reliable repair and insurance infrastructures. Show more How long does an Android phone last? Most Android phones today should last at least seven years. For example, the latest handsets from Google and Samsung come with up to seven years of software support, meaning they'll receive updates and security patches for the long term. Of course, this applies more to flagship and some mid-range phones, whereas budget devices that sell for $300 and less tend to receive shorter commitments. Also: How to find out what apps are draining your Android phone's battery How you handle and use your phone will also determine its lifespan. It's highly advised not to keep your phone charged overnight as that can trigger faster battery degradation. It also helps to put on a case and/or screen protector to keep the device's hardware functioning properly. If it ever feels like your phone isn't lasting as long as it once did, consider swapping out its battery before replacing it with a new device altogether. Show more Which Android version is best? The latest version of Android is 99% of the time also the best version. At the moment, that's Android 16. Show more What is the latest version of Android in 2025? The latest version of Android is Android 16, which debuted with the Google Pixel series, has officially launched across major Android models, including Samsung and OnePlus. Android 16 features new tools like Live Updates, which display real-time tickers on the notification bar, auto-grouping of alerts, desktop windowing, accessibility enhancements, and better security and privacy in general. Show more Which phones get Android 16? The latest version of Android is supported by most smartphone releases in recent years, including the following: Google Pixel 6 series to Pixel 9 series (foldables included)

Samsung Galaxy S22 series to S25 series (foldables and A-series models included)

OnePlus 11 to OnePlus 13 series

Select Sony, Motorola, Nothing, Xiaomi, Honor, Vivo, and Oppo models Show more Which phone OS is most secure? To generalize, most consumers will be choosing between iOS and Android, and between the two, iOS is the more secure operating system. The main reason is that the abundance of Android phones and app makers means there are more opportunities for hackers and data thieves to access your personal information and/or install malware. How these attacks are prevented and managed varies across manufacturers, with some OEMs like Google doing a better job than others like Xiaomi. While iOS on iPhones may feel more restrained and limited in customizations, that results in a more protected and secure software experience, from app availability on the store to how you download files online. Show more Can I use eSIM on an Android phone? While Apple's iPhone 14 made headlines for its eSIM integration, the digital service also works -- and has for some time -- with Android devices, including the latest Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, and OnePlus smartphone. As always, it's best practice to consult with your local carrier before converting to eSIM. Show more What is the best small Android phone? Besides the Motorola Razr Ultra, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is a worthy runner-up, with a 6.2-inch AMOLED, up to 512GB of storage, and a flat-edge design that makes it all the easier to manage with one hand. During ZDNET's testing, the small-but-mighty Android proved capable of handling apps and services typically run on larger devices. Show more

The recently announced Galaxy Z series, consisting of the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, rounds out the brand's summer releases.

Whether you're looking for cutting-edge camera features, all-day battery life, or a foldable screen that doubles as a tablet, there's a Samsung phone designed to meet your needs. When testing Samsung devices, we consider their performance, display quality, endurance, camera capabilities, and unique special features.

What is the best Samsung phone right now?

After extensively testing the latest phones on the market, I've found that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best Samsung phone right now, with the company's top-of-the-line features and specifications, including an S Pen stylus for precision inputs, a 200MP camera system, and the most durable display on any Galaxy phone yet. The size and abundance of features of the S25 Ultra may almost be overwhelming for some users, but you certainly get what you pay for, with its starting price of $1,299.

Our runner-ups on this list are just as noteworthy. The smaller Galaxy S25 Plus variant is nearly as capable as the Ultra model but costs at least $300 less. You'll lose the S Pen and 200MP camera but retain most of the software AI features and AMOLED display. For something more experiential, consider the Galaxy Z Flip 7, which flips and folds into a pocketable square and is accessibly priced.

My real-world testing suggests these AI functions surpass those on competing Android devices in speed, consistency, and overall usefulness. Beyond the AI, the phone has impressed us with its large 6.9-inch, anti-reflective, AMOLED display and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. It helps that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, 12GB of RAM, and improved vapor cooling chamber all contribute to a more power-efficient experience. Durability is another key strength you should be aware of, owing to its lightweight titanium frame and resilient Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass. Sure, you'll see some microscratches from everyday use, but cracking the Ultra model is harder than ever. Furthermore, the camera system is significantly upgraded with a 50MP ultrawide lens that captures landscape and macro shots with greater detail and vibrancy. We've run several camera tests between the S25 Ultra and competing phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, and found the Samsung model to deliver the sharpest and vibrant imagery. Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Who it's for: The Galaxy S25 Ultra is primarily targeted toward users who demand the best smartphone experience Samsung can provide and are keen to explore the latest consumer-facing AI features. It represents a particularly compelling upgrade for individuals holding onto three to four-year-old devices, offering significant advancements across the board. The durable build makes it an excellent choice for those who prioritize drop protection and longevity. Multimedia enthusiasts will appreciate the large, anti-reflective, 6.9-inch screen combined with enhanced cooling for smooth gaming and movie playback. Additionally, photography lovers looking for improved detail and color in wide-angle and close-up macro shots will find the new 50MP ultrawide camera valuable. Who should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't my top choice for everyone. Its $1,299 price point puts it out of reach for budget-conscious consumers, and users who frequently utilize the S Pen's Bluetooth gestures for actions like remotely triggering the camera may be disappointed, as the functionality has been removed. Furthermore, individuals who prefer a less angular or ""boxy"" phone design might find the standard Galaxy S25 Plus or S25 Edge models more aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold. If you don't require the absolute pinnacle of performance, the largest possible screen, or the most advanced camera system Samsung offers, the more affordable S25 Plus and S25 Edge provide many similar core features and represent better value.

It packs the same well-tested Snapdragon 8 Elite processor found in the Ultra and features a capable 50MP primary camera, ensuring high performance and quality photos. Users get the same smooth OneUI software experience, which means many, if not all, of the helpful AI tools found on the Ultra model, like enhanced Gemini and Generative Edit photo features, are available on the Plus, too. Samsung also offers a reassuring seven-year commitment to software updates, keeping the phone up to date for longer than many older models and brands. (For reference, Google offers a similar update standard, but Motorola and OnePlus hover between two and four years.) While the 4,900mAh battery capacity is unchanged from last year's S24 Plus, combining the efficient new processor and AI assistance results in slightly better battery life -- about an hour longer of usage, from the endurance tests we've run. Durability is also solid on the Plus, thanks to its Gorilla Glass screen, aluminum frame, and IP68 water resistance rating. Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus Who it's for: This phone is ideal for those desiring a large-screen Samsung experience and high-end performance, but don't necessarily need every feature the Ultra offers, such as the S Pen or its anti-reflective screen coating. Priced $300 lower than the Ultra with a $999 starting point, the Plus hits a sweet spot for readers looking for great value. The S25 Plus is also well-suited for users comfortable with a maximum internal storage of 512GB (only the Ultra model supports 1TB) who prioritize having the latest processing power and AI software features, backed by long-term update support. Who should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, potential buyers might want to look elsewhere under certain conditions. Heavy photographers or videographers anticipating needing more than 512GB of internal storage should spring for the S25 Ultra, which offers higher capacity options. Similarly, those who desire the unique features of the Ultra, like the integrated S Pen stylus or the enhanced anti-reflective display, should opt for that model instead. In those cases, the Plus model won't fully meet those needs. For alternatives, last year's Galaxy S24 Plus offers a similar large-screen experience and may now be available at a lower price. If you prefer a smaller device but still want similar internal power and features, the standard Galaxy S25 is also worth considering.

Samsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches. Naturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the ""inferior"" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature. Review: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Who it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr. This ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this. Who should look elsewhere: With a starting price tag of $1,999, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead. Users shopping for a foldable phone should consider the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits.

I've been testing the phone for a little more than a week, and it still blows my mind how this design combination exists in 2025. Picking up almost any other big-screen phone is like taking a step back in time. While the S25 Edge is the first of its kind, it features the best aspects of the standard Galaxy S25 models, including the tried-and-tested 200MP main camera of the Ultra, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 12GB of RAM, and a display that gets brighter than most phones when outdoors. Based on my review, the lack of a dedicated telephoto lens on the S25 Edge wasn't sorely missed, as the main sensor retained a good amount of detail even after digitally cropping. Review: Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Who it's for: Tech enthusiasts and users with delicate wrists (myself included) will benefit from the ultra-thin design of the S25 Edge. It really is one of those phones you have to see and hold to truly grasp its extraordinance. And once you use it, every other device will feel like a brick in your hand. You'll also have to be willing to splurge a bit, as the S25 Edge starts at $1,099 for the 256GB variant. That puts it right in between the S25 Plus ($999) and S25 Ultra ($1,299), both of which field larger batteries and more cameras. Should you find a competitive trade-in offer at a retailer or carrier store, then the S25 Edge and its unique design may be worth considering. Who should look elsewhere: While the price of the S25 Edge is one barrier to entry, I'd put it after the most significant caveat, which is battery life. With only a 3,900mAh capacity -- smaller than the standard Galaxy S25's 4,000mAh) -- you should expect to charge the S25 Edge by late afternoon. As a power user, I often found myself topping up the phone before the end of my work shifts, which is not the most ideal if you're a frequent traveler or don't often have a charger nearby. Therefore, if endurance is a priority for you, I'd recommend the S25 Plus (4,900mAh) or Ultra (5,000mAh) models instead. If you're not a fan of Samsung's OneUI software, often criticized for having too many features and apps, it may also be worthwhile to wait for Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air, another thin phone that runs on iOS instead.

Crucially, its inclusion in Samsung's five-year software and security update commitment offers longevity rarely matched by competitors in this price bracket. Review: Samsung Galaxy A36 5G Who it's for: The Galaxy A36 5G is primarily targeted toward value-conscious consumers seeking a highly capable smartphone under the $400 mark. Its combination of a high-quality 120Hz AMOLED screen, a respectable 50MP main camera, and a large 5,000mAh battery addresses the core features many users look for in a reliable daily driver. I recommend the Samsung phone to most people who want a little more power and performance than traditional budget handsets. The A36 5G is also an excellent choice for individuals who value long-term usability and security. The five-year update commitment provides peace of mind and considerably extends the device's lifespan compared to rivals like Motorola and OnePlus.

This makes it a compelling option for consumers focused on value and essential capabilities. For its budget price, the A16 5G includes some of the better specs I've seen in this range, including a sizable 6.7-inch 90Hz AMOLED display, expandable storage up to 1TB, a capable 50MP main camera for day-to-day shots, and four years of security updates. My hands-on testing found the phone surprisingly sturdy to manage, with a smooth display that's great for browsing and watching shows. Also: The best cheap phones ZDNET's tested Who it's for: The Galaxy A16 5G is ideal for budget-conscious buyers prioritizing long battery life, 5G access, and the flexibility of expandable storage without a high cost. It's for those seeking reliable essentials, including students, children, elders, and casual users. It also suits those who want a better-than-average 90Hz AMOLED display -- most phones in this price range have 60Hz displays for more stuttery animations -- and a decent camera for everyday use, backed by long-term software support. Who should look elsewhere: I always remind readers that expectations should align with the price; the A16 5G lacks the premium feel and top-tier performance of flagships, and that's to be expected. Users needing a device that can handle more strenuous tasks like video editing and high-graphics gaming should consider spending more for a midrange or flagship phone. Serious mobile photographers will also find the camera system basic. As an alternative, I'd highly recommend the Google Pixel 8a, which offers a more reliable software and camera experience.

MediaTek processor is just decent for performance Samsung Galaxy A16 5G Best cheap Samsung phone 3.6 / 5 Score Why we like it: The Galaxy A16 5G brings desirable features like 5G connectivity and a large 5,000mAh battery to an impressively low $200 price point. This makes it a compelling option for consumers focused on value and essential capabilities. For its budget price, the A16 5G includes some of the better specs I've seen in this range, including a sizable 6.7-inch 90Hz AMOLED display, expandable storage up to 1TB, a capable 50MP main camera for day-to-day shots, and four years of security updates. My hands-on testing found the phone surprisingly sturdy to manage, with a smooth display that's great for browsing and watching shows. Also: The best cheap phones ZDNET's tested Who it's for: The Galaxy A16 5G is ideal for budget-conscious buyers prioritizing long battery life, 5G access, and the flexibility of expandable storage without a high cost. It's for those seeking reliable essentials, including students, children, elders, and casual users. It also suits those who want a better-than-average 90Hz AMOLED display -- most phones in this price range have 60Hz displays for more stuttery animations -- and a decent camera for everyday use, backed by long-term software support. Who should look elsewhere: I always remind readers that expectations should align with the price; the A16 5G lacks the premium feel and top-tier performance of flagships, and that's to be expected. Users needing a device that can handle more strenuous tasks like video editing and high-graphics gaming should consider spending more for a midrange or flagship phone.

Why choose a Samsung as your smartphone of choice? While previous comparisons have placed Apple ahead of Samsung regarding the overall phone experience, Samsung is arguably the best option in 2025. One reason is the variety of models across different price points, from the A-series that encapsulates the sub-$500 market to the S-series for premium shoppers. Having tested the latest handsets from both brands (and others), I find that the Samsung Galaxy continues to offer the most features and capabilities at relatively competitive prices. When compared to the Google Pixel lineup specifically, Samsung wins out by having a more robust software experience, with greater customizability for users to modify settings, home screen setups, app behaviors, and more. Historically, Google has leaned on Samsung to debut the latest software features, such as Circle to Search and enhanced Gemini, so you can count on Galaxy phones to field more innovative capabilities sooner. Overall, the popularity of Samsung is a key asset to the brand, as there's a greater variety of cases and accessories, as well as more certified repair technicians for after-sales support. Show more

Kerry Wan's smartphone advice

I've used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset. Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone in 2025:

Speeding up your smartphone

Something I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access (rules were meant to be broken, right?).

To turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times, and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From there, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from 1x (default) to 0.5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.

Optimizing your battery health

To preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn (or degrade) the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.

When in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.

How to keep your phone clean

Unless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Samsung Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at 1 meter.

What other Samsung phones are releasing in 2025?

Samsung just wrapped up its July Unpacked event, where it announced the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 devices to the public, so all eyes are now on its rumored tri-foldable phone, which the company first teased back in January, when it suggested that there were several untapped form factors the company was exploring.

More recently, Samsung's Head of Mobile Experience, TM Roh, told The Korea Times that the company is gearing up to launch a tri-foldable phone by the end of the year. If true, we may see an upcoming foldable phone that bends in two ways, with a display that surpasses even the Z Fold 7 in ingenuity.

While Samsung wouldn't be the first to do it -- the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate gets that honor -- it could be the first to launch a phone of such nature in the broader international market, including the US.

The past five years or so have seen the television market diversify to the point where it's hard to keep up. Simple LCD and plasma TVs have been replaced by a veritable alphabet soup of acronyms like QLED, Neo QLED, OLED, Mini LED, Micro LED, and probably a few other variations I'm forgetting. It's a lot for a tech writer to keep track of, let alone the average consumer.

Also: The best TVs money can buy

In this article, I'll clarify the differences between two of the most popular technologies: Neo QLED and OLED. I'll demystify each technology, the pros and cons of both, and define which might best serve you best in your next TV.

What is Neo QLED?

A trio of Samsung's Neo QLED TVs in 4K and 8K resolutions. Samsung

Let's start with the basics. Neo QLED (Neo Quantum Light Emitting Diode) is a name exclusive to Samsung's 4K and 8K televisions. The panels employ what Samsung calls Quantum Matrix technology, which provides backlighting via thousands of tiny LEDs. Each LED is a small fraction of the size of those in older TV backlighting setups. This means that Neo QLED's closest non-proprietary analog is Mini LED (explained below in the FAQ section).

Also: The best QLED TVs you can buy (from 50 to 98 inches)

A Neo QLED panel has thousands of lighting zones. In older TVs, sections of the screen that should be pitch black appear gray or milky due to the limited number of lighting zones. Some older TVs have as few as four for the whole screen. With Neo QLED, precise portions of the screen are lit.

The result is an image with better, sharper contrast between lights and darks, and more accurate colors. Samsung's use of its Quantum Dot technology, which provides additional light filtration on a pixel-by-pixel basis to make the colors more accurate and richly saturated, additionally improves color accuracy.

What is OLED?

OLED is an older, non-proprietary technology that is differentiated by a single layer that provides light and color. Where Neo QLED and most other panel types rely on one layer to provide the colors for the individual pixels and another layer to light up those colored pixels, OLED panel pixels provide their own light.

An OLED TV is essentially an array of millions of microscopic, color-changing LEDs. Each pixel emits colored light, meaning there are as many lighting zones as there are pixels. Each one can also switch off entirely, providing perfect black levels.

As with most technology comparisons, there's no universal answer here. The right answer depends on what content you watch, your budget, your viewing environment, and your personal preferences.

Neo QLED pros and cons

Pros:

Brightness - Due to its use of discrete, miniaturized LEDs for backlighting, Samsung's Neo QLED tech creates images four to five times brighter than OLED panels, on average. This makes Neo QLED panels great for brightly lit rooms.



- Due to its use of discrete, miniaturized LEDs for backlighting, Samsung's Neo QLED tech creates images four to five times brighter than OLED panels, on average. This makes Neo QLED panels great for brightly lit rooms. Refresh rate - While OLED TVs and monitors are finally catching up to their competition's refresh rates, there is a wider selection of Neo QLED displays with higher refresh rates. This refresh rate is important for gaming and watching fast-paced live sports.

- While OLED TVs and monitors are finally catching up to their competition's refresh rates, there is a wider selection of Neo QLED displays with higher refresh rates. This refresh rate is important for gaming and watching fast-paced live sports. Cost - There are certainly more budget-friendly OLED options than ever. However, many models sacrifice port selection, smart TV features, and other useful display tech to reach a budget price while still including OLED panels. Neo QLED, on a feature-by-feature comparison, typically comes at a price of at least a few hundred dollars below an equivalent OLED model.

Cons:

Imperfect black levels - While Neo QLED is one of OLED's closest competitors for ideal black levels, it still can't match the contrast of OLEDs. This deficiency is because Neo QLED lights millions of pixels with only thousands of LEDs. The result is minimal, but still visible, light bleed.

Selection - Unlike OLED TVs, Neo QLED displays are exclusive to Samsung. This exclusivity means that if you're not a fan of Samsung's Smart TV interface, design philosophy, or the company as a whole, you're out of luck. OLED panels are, conversely, made by a slew of manufacturers you can choose from.

OLED panels are, conversely, made by a slew of manufacturers you can choose from. Thickness - It might seem comical to call a Neo QLED TV thick (most are around one inch in depth), but they're still much thicker than OLED panels. There's a reason OLED technology remains so popular in smartphones. The tech provides one of the slimmest display panels you can buy. OLED TVs practically disappear when viewed edge-on.

OLED TVs won't give you a million-dollar infinity pool to look at behind them, but this Sony model would still look futuristic in any living room. Sony

OLED pros and cons



Pros:

Contrast and black levels - OLED's contrast and black levels are unmatched. If you consume a lot of content with dark scenes (like horror movies or video games), you'll have a better experience with an OLED.

Thinness - Although most OLED TVs will have a section toward the bottom end about two inches thick, most of the display is thinner than your smartphone, often dropping to 1/4-inch thick in some models. This thinness provides visual appeal and premium quality, especially when mounted on a wall.

That situation has changed dramatically. Nearly every major manufacturer, Samsung included, has joined the party. OLED models are now available in a wider variety of sizes, resolutions, and price points than ever before.

Cons:

Price - OLED prices have fallen somewhat, but a fully-featured OLED TV will almost always be more expensive than alternative technologies.

Any television will shatter from a hard blow, but OLEDs even require caution when mounting them thanks to their ultraslim display panels. The TVs can't support their weight, making lifting them into place by their beefier bottom sections particularly tricky.

The TVs can't support their weight, making lifting them into place by their beefier bottom sections particularly tricky. Burn-in risk - Burn-in happens when a display retains residual images that won't disappear, no matter how many times its pixels are refreshed. If you've ever had a monitor with a permanent, ghostly version of a Windows taskbar, you've experienced this issue. OLED panels can be more prone to burn-in than competing LED technology. While manufacturers have used numerous methods to combat this issue, and panels are more resilient than they have been before, it's still worth considering, especially if you expect to display static imagery for extended periods.

Should I buy a Neo QLED or OLED TV?



There are some categories of consumers to whom I would recommend one type over the other:

Gamers or sports fans - Neo QLED: The additional available brightness, more common availability of 120Hz refresh rates, and lack of worry about in-game graphics or sports score overlays causing burn-in all point toward Neo QLED being the better choice.

Viewers with super-bright living rooms - Neo QLED: OLED's rich colors and dark blacks won't matter if the image is too dark to see due to ambient light from windows or lamps. While you can try to reduce room light using window treatments or dimmers, it's not always practical. For this reason, the vastly superior maximum brightness of Neo QLED wins here.

Picky interior decorators and others who prioritize aesthetics - OLED: The ultraslim profile of an OLED TV gives it two advantages. First, it makes the TV almost vanish when viewed from the side. Second, it makes the television much easier to hide in a cabinet.

Both Neo QLED and OLED TVs are great, and you're not going to be disappointed with either. There are models of either TV type that will blow away anything that came before, and will likely make you forget any doubts you had the second you flip it on for the first time in your living room.

This is a common point of contention between shoppers in the same household.

Samsung advises using ""Viewing distance (in inches)/2 = recommended TV size"" as your rule of thumb. This means you should get a 60-inch TV if you plan to sit 10 feet (120 inches) from the display, a 30-inch model if you're only 5 feet away, or a massive 80-inch screen if you're over 13 feet away.

What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot with advanced natural language processing (NLP) that allows you to have human-like conversations to complete various tasks. The generative AI tool can answer questions and assist you with composing text, code, and much more.

Also: How to use ChatGPT

It's currently open to use for free. OpenAI launched a paid subscription version called ChatGPT Plus in February 2023, which guarantees users access to the company's latest models, exclusive features, and updates but is not necessary for basic usage.

What is ChatGPT used for?

ChatGPT offers many functions in addition to answering simple questions. ChatGPT can compose essays, have philosophical conversations, do math, and even code for you.

The tasks ChatGPT can help with don't have to be so ambitious. For example, my favorite use case for ChatGPT is to help create basic lists for chores, such as packing and grocery shopping, and to-do lists that make my daily life more productive. The possibilities are endless.

ZDNET has published many ChatGPT how-to guides. Below are some of the most popular ones.

Use ChatGPT to:

Is ChatGPT available for free?

ChatGPT is free, regardless of what you use it for, including writing, coding, and much more.

There is a subscription option, ChatGPT Plus, that costs $20 per month. The paid subscription model gives you extra perks, such as priority access to GPT-4o, DALL-E 3, unlimited photogeneration, Canvas, Voice Mode, and the latest upgrades.

Also: ChatGPT vs ChatGPT Plus: Is it worth the subscription fee?

Although the subscription price may seem steep, it is the same amount as Microsoft Copilot Pro and Google One AI Premium, which are Microsoft's and Google's paid AI offerings.

How can you access ChatGPT?

On April 1, 2024, OpenAI stopped requiring you to log in to ChatGPT. Now, you can access ChatGPT simply by visiting chat.openai.com. You can also access ChatGPT via an iPhone, Android, or desktop app.

Once you visit the site, you can start chatting away with ChatGPT. A great way to get started is by asking a question, similar to what you would do with Google. You can ask as many questions as you'd like.

Also: ChatGPT no longer requires a login, but you might want one anyway. Here's why

Creating an OpenAI account still offers some perks, such as saving and reviewing your chat history, accessing custom instructions, and, most importantly, getting free access to GPT-4o. Signing up is free and easy; you can use your existing Google login.

For step-by-step instructions, check out ZDNET's guide on how to start using ChatGPT.

Is there a ChatGPT app?

Yes, an official ChatGPT app is available for iPhone and Android users. Make sure to download OpenAI's app, as many copycat fake apps are listed on Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store that are not affiliated with OpenAI.

Also: I changed 5 ChatGPT settings and instantly became more productive - here's how

There's also a ChatGPT app for MacOS and Windows, which lets you access the chatbot quickly via a keyboard shortcut. The Mac app was initially only available for ChatGPT Plus subscribers, but OpenAI recently made it available to all users. The Windows app is still limited to ChatGPT Plus, Enterprise, and EDU users.

Is ChatGPT safe?

People have expressed concerns about AI chatbots replacing or atrophying human intelligence.

For example, chatbots can write an entire essay in seconds, raising concerns about students cheating and not learning how to write properly. These fears even led some school districts to block access when ChatGPT initially launched.

Now, not only have many of those schools decided to unblock the technology, but some higher education institutions have been catering their academic offerings to AI-related coursework.

Also: Two ways you can build custom AI assistants with GPT-4o - and one is free

Another concern with AI chatbots is the possible spread of misinformation. ChatGPT says: ""My responses are not intended to be taken as fact, and I always encourage people to verify any information they receive from me or any other source."" OpenAI also notes that ChatGPT sometimes writes ""plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers.""

Lastly, there are ethical and privacy concerns regarding the information ChatGPT was trained on. OpenAI scraped the internet to train the chatbot without asking content owners for permission to use their content, which brings up many copyright and intellectual property concerns.

Also: How to use ChatGPT to analyze PDFs for free

There are also privacy concerns regarding generative AI companies using your data to fine-tune their models further, which has become a common practice. OpenAI lets you turn off training in ChatGPT's settings.

So, is ChatGPT safe? If your main concern is privacy, OpenAI has implemented several options to give users peace of mind that their data will not be used to train models. The company even allows you to turn off your chat history. If you are concerned about moral and ethical problems, they are still being hotly debated.

Will my conversations with ChatGPT be used for training?

Companies train generative AI models on user inputs. Therefore, when familiarizing yourself with how to use ChatGPT, you might wonder if your specific conversations will be used for training and, if so, who can view your chats.

Also: This ChatGPT update fixed one of my biggest productivity issues with the AI chatbot

OpenAI will, by default, use your conversations with the free chatbot to train data and refine its models. You can opt out of it using your data for model training by clicking on the question mark in the bottom left-hand corner, Settings, and turning off ""Improve the model for everyone.""

Can ChatGPT help me apply for jobs?

Yes, ChatGPT is a great resource for helping with job applications. Undertaking a job search can be tedious and difficult, and ChatGPT can help you lighten the load. ChatGPT can build your resume and write a cover letter.

Also: How to use ChatGPT to write an essay

If your application has any written supplements, you can use ChatGPT to help you write those essays or personal statements. You can also use ChatGPT to prep for your interviews by asking ChatGPT to provide you mock interview questions, background on the company, or questions that you can ask.

Can you use ChatGPT for schoolwork?

ChatGPT can be an excellent resource in assisting students with their work. A popular misconception is that ChatGPT and other AI resources will do students' work for them. However, it can be used as a personal tutor or editor, giving students assistance outside of the classroom.

Also: 5 free AI tools for school that students, teachers, and parents can use, too

For example, a student can drop their essay into ChatGPT and have it copyedit, upload class handwritten notes and have them digitized, or even generate study outlines from class materials.

It is especially helpful for coding homework since most coding languages are very character-sensitive, and one missing semicolon can throw the entire result off. Instead of staring at the screen for ages, you can ask ChatGPT to identify errors for you, which allows you to grow.

What does ChatGPT stand for?

The last three letters in ChatGPT's namesake stand for Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), a family of large language models created by OpenAI that uses deep learning to generate human-like, conversational text.

Also: What does GPT stand for? Understanding GPT 3.5, GPT 4, GPT-4 Turbo, and more

The ""Chat"" part of the name is simply a callout to its chatting capabilities.

Can ChatGPT generate images?

Yes, ChatGPT can generate images using DALL-E 3. However, the limits vary depending on whether you are a ChatGPT Plus subscriber or a free user. ChatGPT Plus subscribers are allowed 50 generations per day, while free users are allotted two.

Also: The best AI image generators of 2024: Tested and reviewed

Since OpenAI discontinued DALL-E 2 in February 2024, the only way to access its most advanced AI image generator, DALL-E 3, through OpenAI's offerings is via its chatbot.

Microsoft's Copilot offers free image generation, also powered by DALL-E 3, in its chatbot. This is a great alternative if you don't want to pay for ChatGPT Plus but want high-quality image outputs for free.

How does ChatGPT work?

ChatGPT runs on a large language model (LLM) architecture created by OpenAI called the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Since its launch, the free version of ChatGPT ran on a fine-tuned model in the GPT-3.5 series until May 2024, when OpenAI upgraded the model to GPT-4o. Now, the free version runs on GPT-4o mini, with limited access to GPT-4o.

Also: How does ChatGPT actually work?

With a subscription to ChatGPT Plus, you can access GPT-4, GPT-4o mini or GPT-4o. Plus, users also have priority access to GPT-4o, even at capacity, while free users get booted down to GPT-4o mini.

The LLMs used in generative AI models of this type are trained on vast amounts of information from the internet, including websites, books, news articles, and more, typically via web scraping, where the entirety of the internet is scraped for information.

Who owns ChatGPT currently?

OpenAI launched ChatGPT on November 30, 2022. OpenAI has also developed DALL-E 2 and DALL-E 3, popular AI image generators, and Whisper, an automatic speech recognition system.

Also: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT, Copilot and worthy alternatives

As a result, OpenAI owns ChatGPT. Microsoft is a major investor in OpenAI thanks to multiyear, multi-billion dollar investments. Elon Musk was an investor when OpenAI was first founded in 2015 but has since completely severed ties with the startup and created his own AI chatbot,Grok.

Is ChatGPT better than a search engine?

ChatGPT is an AI chatbot created to converse with the end user. A search engine indexes web pages on the internet to help users find information. One is not better than the other, as each suits different purposes.

When searching for as much up-to-date, accurate information as possible, your most reliable option is a search engine. It will provide you with pages upon pages of sources you can peruse.

Also: ChatGPT has officially replaced Google Search for me - here's why

In November 2024, OpenAI already unveiled ChatGPT Search, a feature within the ChatGPT app that lets users search the web for timely, up-to-date information, complete with citations linked to sources.

With ChatGPT Search, you can enter your sentence as your train of thought takes you, and the AI will understand the meaning of your query by leveraging its NLP capabilities. This means you can spend less time crafting a tailored search query but still get exactly what you want.

If you are looking for a platform that can explain complex topics in an easy-to-understand manner, then ChatGPT might be what you want. If you want the best of both worlds, plenty of AI search engines combine both.

The search experience is available on the ChatGPT website, desktops, and mobile apps for all ChatGPT Plus, Team users, and SearchGPT waitlist users.

What is SearchGPT?

SearchGPT is an experimental offering from OpenAI that functions as an AI-powered search engine that is aware of current events and uses real-time information from the Internet. The experience was a prototype. OpenAI integrated the best features directly into ChatGPT with ChatGPT Search.

Upon launching the prototype, users were given a waitlist to sign up for. However, shortly after, OpenAI closed its waitlist. Those users were given priority access to ChatGPT Search when it launched.

What is ChatGPT Search?

In November, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT Search, a feature that lets users search the web directly within ChatGPT for timely, up-to-date information, complete with citations linked to sources. The tool can be called on manually or activated whenever a user prompt could benefit from web-based information.

What are ChatGPT's limitations?

Despite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT still has limitations. Users sometimes need to reword questions multiple times for ChatGPT to understand their intent. A bigger limitation is a lack of quality in responses, which can sometimes be plausible-sounding but are verbose or make no practical sense.

Also: Police are using AI to write crime reports. What could go wrong?

Instead of asking for clarification on ambiguous questions, the model guesses what your question means, which can lead to poor responses. Generative AI models are also subject to hallucinations, which can result in inaccurate responses.

Does ChatGPT give wrong answers?

As mentioned above, ChatGPT, like all language models, has limitations and can give nonsensical answers and incorrect information, so it's important to double-check the answers it gives you.

Also: 8 ways to reduce ChatGPT hallucinations

OpenAI recommends you provide feedback on what ChatGPT generates by using the thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons to improve its underlying model. You can also join the startup's Bug Bounty program, which offers up to $20,000 for reporting security bugs and safety issues.

Can ChatGPT refuse to answer my prompts?

AI systems like ChatGPT can and do reject inappropriate requests. The AI assistant can identify inappropriate submissions to prevent unsafe content generation.

Also: 6 things ChatGPT can't do (and another 20 it refuses to do)

These submissions include questions that violate someone's rights, are offensive, are discriminatory, or involve illegal activities. The ChatGPT model can also challenge incorrect premises, answer follow-up questions, and even admit mistakes when you point them out.

These guardrails are important. AI models can generate advanced, realistic content that can be exploited by bad actors for harm, such as spreading misinformation about public figures and influencing elections.

Does ChatGPT plagiarize?

Yes, OpenAI scraped the internet to train ChatGPT's models. Therefore, the technology's knowledge is influenced by other people's work. Since there is no guarantee that ChatGPT's outputs are entirely original, the chatbot may regurgitate someone else's work in your answer, which is considered plagiarism.

Also, technically speaking, if you, as a user, copy and paste ChatGPT's response, that is an act of plagiarism because you are claiming someone else's work as your own. This act could have repercussions based on the rules enforced by your workplace or educational institution.

Is there a ChatGPT detector?

In short, the answer is no, not because people haven't tried, but because none do it efficiently.

In January 2023, OpenAI released a free tool to detect AI-generated text. Unfortunately, OpenAI's classifier tool could only correctly identify 26% of AI-written text with a ""likely AI-written"" designation. Furthermore, it provided false positives 9% of the time, incorrectly identifying human-written work as AI-produced.

Also: I tested 7 AI content detectors - they're getting dramatically better at identifying plagiarism

The tool performed so poorly that, six months after its release, OpenAI shut it down ""due to its low rate of accuracy."" Despite the tool's failure, the startup claims to be researching more effective techniques for AI text identification.

Other AI detectors exist on the market, including GPT-2 Output Detector, Writer AI Content Detector, and Content at Scale's AI Content Detection tool. ZDNET tested these tools, and the results were underwhelming: all three were unreliable sources for spotting AI, repeatedly giving false negatives. Here are ZDNET's full test results.

What is GPT-4?

GPT-4 is OpenAI's language model, much more advanced than its predecessor, GPT-3.5. GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 in a series of simulated benchmark exams and produces fewer hallucinations.

What is GPT-4o?

GPT-4o is OpenAI's latest, fastest, and most advanced flagship model. As the name implies, GPT-4o has the same intelligence as GPT-4. However, the ""o"" in the title stands for ""omni,"" referring to its multimodal capabilities, which allow the model to understand text, audio, image, and video inputs and output text, audio, and image outputs.

Also: 6 ways OpenAI just supercharged ChatGPT for free users

The model is 50% cheaper in OpenAI's API than GPT-4 Turbo while still matching its English and coding capabilities and outperforming it in non-English language, vision, and audio understanding -- a big win for developers.

What is ChatGPT o1?

In September 2024, OpenAI unveiled its o1 models, which are capable of more advanced reading, making them ideal for math, science, and coding. For example, it scored 83% on the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exam. For comparison, GPT-4o correctly solved only 13% of problems.

Also: What are o1 and o1-mini? OpenAI's mystery AI models are finally here

ZDNET's David Gewirtz put o1- preview to the test and was impressed by its ability to tackle several complex tasks with lots of detail, including writing a WordPress plugin, rewriting a string function, finding an annoying bug, and more.

What are the best ChatGPT alternatives?

Although ChatGPT gets the most buzz, other options are just as good -- and might even be better suited to your needs. ZDNET has created a list of the best chatbots, all of which we have tested to identify the best tool for your requirements.

Despite ChatGPT's extensive abilities, other chatbots have advantages that might be better suited for your use case, including Copilot, Claude, Perplexity, Jasper, and more.

What are GPTs?

OpenAI once offered plugins for ChatGPT to connect to third-party applications and access real-time information on the web. The plugins expanded ChatGPT's abilities, allowing it to assist with many more activities, such as planning a trip or finding a place to eat.

Also: My two favorite ChatGPT Plus features and the remarkable things I can do with them

However, on March 19, 2024, OpenAI stopped letting users install new plugins or start new conversations with existing ones. Instead, OpenAI replaced plugins with GPTs, which are easier for developers to build.

With the latest update, all users, including those on the free plan, can access the GPT Store and find 3 million customized ChatGPT chatbots. Unfortunately, there is also a lot of spam in the GPT store, so be careful which ones you use.

What is Microsoft's involvement with ChatGPT?

Microsoft was an early investor in OpenAI, the AI startup behind ChatGPT, long before ChatGPT was released to the public. Microsoft's first involvement with OpenAI was in 2019 when the company invested $1 billion. The company invested another $2 billion in the years after. In January 2023, Microsoft extended its partnership with OpenAI through a multiyear, multi-billion dollar investment.

Also: ChatGPT vs. Copilot: Which AI chatbot is better for you?

Neither company disclosed the investment value, but unnamed sources told Bloomberg that it could total $10 billion over multiple years. In return, OpenAI's exclusive cloud-computing provider -- Microsoft Azure, powers all OpenAI workloads across research, products, and API services.

Microsoft has also used its OpenAI partnership to revamp its Bing search engine and improve its browser. On February 7, 2023, Microsoft unveiled a new Bing tool, now known as Copilot, that runs on OpenAI's GPT-4, customized specifically for search.

How does Copilot compare to ChatGPT?

Copilot uses OpenAI's GPT-4, which means that since its launch, it has been more efficient and capable than the standard, free version of ChatGPT, which was powered by GPT 3.5 at the time. At the time, Copilot boasted several other features over ChatGPT, such as access to the internet, knowledge of current information, and footnotes.

Also: I was a Copilot diehard until ChatGPT added these 5 features

In May 2024, however, OpenAI supercharged the free version of its chatbot with GPT-4o. The upgrade gave users GPT-4 level intelligence, the ability to get responses from the web, analyze data, chat about photos and documents, use GPTs, and access the GPT Store and Voice Mode. After the upgrade, ChatGPT reclaimed its crown as the best AI chatbot.

What is Gemini and how does it relate to ChatGPT?

Gemini is Google's AI chat service, a rival to ChatGPT. On February 6, 2023, Google introduced its experimental AI chat service, which was then called Google Bard.

Also: ChatGPT vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Gemini: Which is the best AI chatbot?

Over a month after the announcement, Google began rolling out access to Bard first via a waitlist. Now, the tool is available to the public. The biggest perk of Gemini is that it has Google Search at its core and has the same feel as Google products. Therefore, if you are an avid Google user, Gemini might be the best AI chatbot for you.

What is Apple's involvement with OpenAI?

At Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference in June 2024, the company announced a partnership with OpenAI that will integrate ChatGPT with Siri. With the user's permission, Siri can request ChatGPT for help if Siri deems a task is better suited for ChatGPT.

Back in the day (and by ""in the day,"" I mean late 2022, before AI chatbots exploded on the scene), tools like Google and Wolfram Alpha interacted with users via a single-line text entry field and provided text results. Google returned search results -- a list of web pages and articles that would (hopefully) provide information related to the search queries. Wolfram Alpha generally provided answers that were mathematical and data analysis-related.

ChatGPT, by contrast, provides a response based on the context and intent behind a user's question. Google, of course, has changed up its response mode. It now provides AI-based responses before search results, and it's likely to continue to do so. Wolfram Alpha, on the other hand, uses AI behind the scenes to help it with its calculations but does not provide AI-based answers.

Also: How to use ChatGPT: A beginner's guide to the most popular AI chatbot

Fundamentally, Google's searching power is its ability to do enormous database lookups and provide a series of matches. Wolfram Alpha's power is its ability to parse data-related questions and perform calculations.

ChatGPT's power (and that of almost any other AI chatbot, like Claude, Copilot, Perplexity, and Google Gemini) is the ability to parse queries and produce fully fleshed-out answers and results based on most of the world's digitally accessible text-based information. Some chatbots have restrictions based on when they stopped scanning information, but most can now access the live Internet to factor current data into their answers.

In this article, we'll see how ChatGPT can produce those fully fleshed-out answers using a technology called generative artificial intelligence. We'll start by looking at the main phases of ChatGPT operation, then cover some core AI architecture components that make it all work.

The two main phases of ChatGPT operation

Let's use Google Search (as distinguished from Google Gemini AI) as an analogy again. When you ask Google Search to look up something, you probably know that it doesn't -- at the moment you ask -- go out and scour the entire web for answers. Instead, Google searches its database for pages that match that request. Google search has two main phases: the spidering and data-gathering phase, and the user interaction/lookup phase.

Also: The best AI chatbots: ChatGPT and other fun alternatives to try

Roughly speaking, ChatGPT and the other AI chatbots work the same way. The data-gathering phase is called pre-training, while the user responsiveness phase is known as inference. The magic behind generative AI and the reason it has exploded is that the way pre-training works has proven to be enormously scalable. That scalability has been made possible by recent innovations in affordable hardware technology and cloud computing.

How pre-training AI works

Generally speaking (because getting into specifics would take volumes), AIs pre-train using two principal approaches: supervised and non-supervised. Most AI projects until the current crop of generative AI systems like ChatGPT used the supervised approach.

Also: How to make ChatGPT provide sources and citations

Supervised pre-training is a process where a model is trained on a labeled dataset, where each input is associated with a corresponding output.

For example, an AI could be trained on a dataset of customer service conversations, where the user's questions and complaints are labeled with the appropriate responses from the customer service representative. To train the AI, questions like, ""How can I reset my password?"" would be provided as user input, and answers like, ""You can reset your password by visiting the account settings page on our website and following the prompts,"" would be provided as output.

In a supervised training approach, the overall model is trained to learn a mapping function that can map inputs to outputs accurately. This process is often used in supervised learning tasks, such as classification, regression, and sequence labeling.

As you might imagine, there are limits to how this can scale. Human trainers would have to go pretty far in anticipating all the inputs and outputs. Training could take a very long time and be limited in subject matter expertise.

Also: My two favorite ChatGPT Plus features and the remarkable things I can do with them

But as we've come to realize, ChatGPT has very few limits in subject matter expertise. You can ask it to write a resume for the character Chief Miles O'Brien from Star Trek, have it explain quantum physics, write a piece of code, produce a short piece of fiction, and compare the governing styles of former presidents of the United States.

It would be impossible to anticipate all the questions that would ever be asked, so there is no way that ChatGPT could have been trained with a supervised model. Instead, ChatGPT uses non-supervised pre-training -- and this is the game-changer.

Non-supervised pre-training is the process by which a model is trained on data where no specific output is associated with each input. Instead, the model is trained to learn the underlying structure and patterns in the input data without any task in mind. This process is often used in unsupervised learning tasks, such as clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction. In language modeling, non-supervised pre-training can train a model to understand the syntax and semantics of natural language so the model can generate coherent and meaningful text in a conversational context.

Also: Is ChatGPT Plus really worth $20 when the free version offers so many premium features?

It's here where ChatGPT's apparently limitless knowledge becomes possible. Because the developers don't need to know the outputs that come from the inputs, all they have to do is dump more and more information into the ChatGPT pre-training mechanism, which is called transformer-based language modeling.

Also: How AI companies are secretly collecting training data from the web (and why it matters)

It's also here, in the dumping of data into the AI, that modern chatbot makers have started to find themselves in trouble. AI companies have been training their AIs on copyrighted information from other companies without permission. In fact, some publishers, like Ziff Davis (ZDNET's parent company) and the New York Times, are suing OpenAI for copyright infringement. You've probably seen the disclaimer on ZDNET that says, ""Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.""

This universal training approach does make the chatbots more capable. But the side effect is they are taking traffic away from the companies and writers who wrote the original content. Expect this aspect of generative AI to be fought in the courts for years to come.

But this article is about technology, so let's move on to a key technology that makes generative AI possible...

Transformer architecture

Transformer architecture is a type of neural network that is used for processing natural language data. A neural network simulates how a human brain works by processing information through layers of interconnected nodes. You can think of a neural network like a hockey team. Each player has a role, but they pass the puck back and forth among players with specific positions, all working together to score the goal.

The transformer architecture processes sequences of words by using ""self-attention"" to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence when making predictions. Self-attention is similar to how a reader might look back at a previous sentence or paragraph for the context needed to understand a new word in a book. The transformer looks at all the words in a sequence to understand the context and the relationships between them.

Also: How I used ChatGPT to quickly fix a critical plugin - without touching a line of code

The transformer is made up of several layers, each with multiple sub-layers. The two main sub-layers are the self-attention layer and the feedforward layer. The self-attention layer computes the importance of each word in the sequence, while the feedforward layer applies non-linear transformations to the input data. These layers help the transformer learn and understand the relationships between the words in a sequence.

During training, the transformer is given input data, such as a sentence, and is asked to make a prediction based on that input. The model is updated based on how well its prediction matches the actual output. Through this process, the transformer learns to understand the context and relationships between words in a sequence, making it a powerful tool for natural language processing tasks such as language translation and text generation.

One thing to remember is that there are issues around the potential for these models to generate harmful or biased content, as they may learn patterns and biases present in the training data. The companies implementing these models are trying to provide ""guard rails,"" but those guard rails may themselves cause issues. Those concerns are because different people have different perspectives. An attempt to prevent bias based on one school of thought may be claimed as bias by another school of thought. This situation makes the design of a universal chatbot difficult because society is complex.

Let's discuss the data that gets fed into ChatGPT first, and then the user-interaction phase of ChatGPT and natural language.

ChatGPT's training datasets

The dataset used to train ChatGPT is huge. ChatGPT is based on something called a large language model, or LLM. Let's take a moment to clarify chatbot vs. LLM. A chatbot is essentially an app with a user interface. It takes in questions or prompts, feeds those to an LLM, and then retrieves the answers, formats them, and presents them to a user. Essentially, a chatbot is a UI shell. It's the LLM that provides the AI capability itself.

LLMs come in a wide variety of names and versions. Right now, the main ChatGPT LLM is GPT-4o. When ChatGPT burst onto the scene back in early 2023, the LLM was GPT-3. There are some LLMs, like OpenAI's o3, that spend more time reasoning, while others are better at interacting with human communication styles. Over time, the LLMs get better, and as a result, the chatbots themselves get more capable as well.

GPT is an acronym that covers three areas: it's generative (G), meaning it generates results; it's pre-trained (P), meaning it's based on all the data it ingests; and it uses the transformer architecture (T), which weighs text inputs to understand context.

GPT-3 was trained on a dataset called WebText2, a library of over 45 terabytes of text data. When you can buy a 16-terabyte hard drive for under $300, a 45-terabyte corpus may not seem that large. But text takes up a lot less storage space than pictures or video.

Also: How to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus (and 7 reasons why you should)

This massive amount of data allowed ChatGPT to learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases in natural language at an unprecedented scale, which is one of the reasons why it is so effective at generating coherent and contextually relevant responses to user queries.

While ChatGPT is based on the GPT architecture, it has been fine-tuned on multiple datasets and optimized for conversational use cases. This process allows it to provide a more personalized and engaging experience for users who interact with the technology via a chat interface.

For example, OpenAI (developers of ChatGPT) has released a dataset called Persona-Chat that is specifically designed for training conversational AI models like ChatGPT. This dataset consists of over 160,000 dialogues between two human participants, with each participant assigned a unique persona that describes their background, interests, and personality. This process allows ChatGPT to learn how to generate responses that are personalized to the specific context of the conversation.

In addition to these datasets, ChatGPT was trained on lots of unstructured data found on the internet, including websites, books, and other text sources. This allowed ChatGPT to learn about the structure and patterns of language in a more general sense, which could then be fine-tuned for specific applications like dialogue management or sentiment analysis.

ChatGPT is a distinct model trained using a similar approach to the GPT series but with some differences in architecture and training data.

Also: The best AI image generators of 2025: Gemini, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and more

Overall, the training data used to fine-tune ChatGPT is typically conversational and specifically curated to include dialogues between humans, allowing ChatGPT to learn how to generate natural and engaging responses in a conversational format.

Here's how to think of ChatGPT's unsupervised training: it was fed a lot of data and left to its own devices to find patterns and make sense of it all. This mechanism allowed the new generative AI systems to scale up so quickly.

While the pre-training process does the heavy lifting for ChatGPT's generative AI, the technology also has to understand questions and construct answers from data. That part is done by the inference phase, which consists of natural language processing and dialogue management.

What about human involvement in pre-training?

Despite the inherent scalability of non-supervised pre-training, there is some evidence that human assistance may have been involved in the preparation of ChatGPT for public use.

The big reveal was in an article in TIME Magazine that discussed human ""data labelers"" earning between $1.32 and $2/hour in Kenya. According to the TIME report, it was the responsibility of these workers to scan horrifying and sexually explicit internet content to flag it for ChatGPT training.

Another article, posted in Martechpost, an AI newsletter, states that the large language model was trained using a process called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): ""The training process involved a fine-tuned initial model using supervised learning, with human trainers playing both the role of the user and an AI assistant.""

There are some subtleties around what the word ""training"" means. According to ChatGPT itself, ""OpenAI did not use reinforcement learning with human feedback to train me. Instead, I was pre-trained using a combination of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques, such as language modeling, auto-encoding, and sequence prediction. My training involved processing massive amounts of text data from the internet, which allowed me to learn patterns and relationships between words and phrases.""

The AI continued, ""However, once I was pre-trained, researchers and developers can use reinforcement learning with human feedback to fine-tune me for specific tasks or domains, such as answering questions or generating text. In these cases, humans can provide feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, which can be used to update my parameters and improve my performance on similar tasks in the future.""

This answer seems to fit with the Marktechpost and TIME reports, in that the initial pre-training was non-supervised, allowing a tremendous amount of data to be fed into the system. But in building the dialogue responses that communicate with users (more on that below), the response engines were apparently trained both on the types of responses and to filter out inappropriate material—and that training seems to have been human-assisted.

Natural language processing

Natural language processing (NLP) focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. With the exponential growth of digital data and the increasing use of natural language interfaces, NLP has become a crucial technology for many businesses.

NLP technologies can be used for many applications, including sentiment analysis, chatbots, speech recognition, and translation. By leveraging NLP, businesses can automate tasks, improve customer service, and gain valuable insights from customer feedback and social media posts.

Also: How to write better ChatGPT prompts

One of the key challenges in implementing NLP is dealing with the complexity and ambiguity of human language. NLP algorithms need to be trained on large amounts of data to recognize patterns and learn the nuances of language. They also need to be continually refined and updated to keep up with changes in language use and context.

The technology works by breaking down language inputs, such as sentences or paragraphs, into smaller components and analyzing their meanings and relationships to generate insights or responses. NLP technologies use multiple techniques, including statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning, to recognize patterns and learn from large amounts of data to accurately interpret and generate language.

Dialogue management

You may have noticed that ChatGPT can ask follow-up questions to clarify your intent or better understand your needs, and provide personalized responses that consider the entire conversation history.

This approach is how ChatGPT can have multi-turn conversations with users that feel natural and engaging. The process involves using algorithms and machine learning techniques to understand the context of a conversation and maintain it over multiple exchanges with the user.

Also: How to use ChatGPT to write code - and my top trick for debugging what it generates

Dialogue management is an important aspect of natural language processing because it allows computer programs to interact with people in a way that feels more like a conversation than a series of one-off interactions. This approach can help build trust and engagement with users and lead to better outcomes for both the user and the organization using the program.

Marketers, of course, want to expand how trust is built up, but this is also an area that could prove scary because it's one way an AI might be able to manipulate the people who use it.

A look inside the hardware that runs ChatGPT

Microsoft released a video that discusses how Azure is used to create a network to run all the computation and storage required by ChatGPT. It's a fascinating watch for its discussion of Azure and how AI is architected in real hardware.

FAQ How does ChatGPT's generative AI differ from traditional chatbots? Traditional chatbots operate on predefined rules and decision trees, responding to specific user inputs with predetermined answers. ChatGPT, on the other hand, utilizes generative AI, allowing it to produce unique responses by understanding context and intent, making interactions more dynamic and human-like. Show more Why is non-supervised pre-training considered a game-changer for AI models like ChatGPT? Non-supervised pre-training allows AI models to learn from vast amounts of unlabeled data. This approach helps the model grasp the nuances of language without being restricted to specific tasks, enabling it to generate more diverse and contextually relevant responses. Show more Are there any limitations to ChatGPT's ability to understand and respond to user queries? Yes. ChatGPT relies on the data it was trained on, which means it might not always have information on recent topics or niche subjects. Additionally, its responses are generated based on patterns in the data, so it might occasionally produce factually incorrect answers or lack context. Plus, the data it's trained on may be wrong or even weaponized to be outright misleading. Show more

And now you know

Even though we're over 3,200 words, this is still a rudimentary overview of all that happens inside ChatGPT. That said, perhaps now you understand more about why this technology has exploded over the past few years. The key to success is that the data itself isn't ""supervised"" and the AI can take what it's been fed and make sense of it.

This data can include your precise physical location, address, and device ID, as well as your search history, payment information, and contacts.

Some apps use this data to track you across apps and websites, to understand performance, and to target you with ads.

Some of this data is linked to your identity, and some isn't -- the connection depends on the app you're using. In recent years, people have been increasingly concerned about how their data is being stored and are wary specifically of data storage by Chinese-based apps.

Also: Is Temu safe? Why its single-layer security should be a red flag to shoppers

According to Temu's privacy policy, the company does not ""sell"" your data -- for money, at least. However, Temu does share your information with shipping affiliates, marketing providers, and consumer research companies, which generates revenue for Temu.

Temu also ""shares"" your data with third-party advertising, marketing, and analytics companies to target you with ads. In its privacy policy, Temu acknowledges that this transfer of data can be considered ""selling"" your data under applicable laws.

Although concerns about sharing your data with Temu might be valid, it's important to remember that apps can and do collect and store your data with few limits. US. citizens' user data is not federally protected under a single law, so data collection remains unregulated in most states.

Because American user data remains federally unregulated, Temu might access your credit history, Walmart might collect your biometric information (fingerprints, face geometry, and retina imagery), and Amazon might collect your voice recordings when you speak to Alexa.

As Americans' user data is not wholly protected, it's up to the individual to decide how much of their data they want to relinquish -- and which platforms they want to give it to.

Remember, when you sign up for an account on any platform, you agree to the company's privacy policy. So, Temu is not ""stealing"" your data if you willingly sign up and purchase items.

The bottom line is that if you don't consent to this kind of data collection, stay away from Temu.",,"Jada Jones, March, At A.M.

Cache -- or browser cache -- is the temporary storage of website files. So, things like images, scripts, and cookies that your browser saves on your phone to make pages load faster the next time you visit.

Also: Every iPhone model that can be updated to iOS 26 (and which ones don't support it)

Over time, though, those files can add up, taking a large bite out of your device storage and slowing things down. That's why it's smart to clear your browser cache regularly. In this article, I focused on clearing Safari and Chrome's cache on an iPhone, but keep in mind that apps and even your phone's processor have their own caches, too.

How to clear your app cache on iPhone

You can clear an app's cache by deleting and reinstalling it -- or, when available, using an in-app ""Clear Cache"" option. Since iOS doesn't offer a universal cache-clearing tool, each app handles it differently. TikTok and CapCut include a built-in cache-clear button, Amazon lets you erase your browsing history, and Reddit offers a way to wipe local history. It depends on an app's features.

Is 'clear cache' the same as offloading?

Not quite. Offloading an app via your iPhone's settings can boost performance when your storage is tight by uninstalling the app and keeping its documents and data intact. Just go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage, tap the app you want, and choose Offload App. This removes the app and its cache but leaves your data in place, so when you reinstall it, you'll pick up right where you left off.

Are cookies and cache the same thing?

Cache and cookies are not the same.

Cache stores copies of images, scripts, and other page elements so sites load faster on your next visit, while cookies are small data files that remember specific information about you -- like login credentials, site preferences, or items in your shopping cart.

Also: Cookie pop-ups don't have to be a fact of life online - how I block them and why

Clearing your cache removes those saved page files but won't log you out of sites, whereas deleting cookies will wipe your saved logins and settings, forcing you to sign in again and reset any preferences.

Can you block cookies on an iPhone?

You can block cookies in Safari. Turning them off stops sites from tracking you, but it can also break some websites or limit features. So, you'll need to weigh privacy against usability. If you'd like to block cookies in Safari, follow these steps:

Go to Settings and select Safari. Tap on the toggle next to Block All Cookies.

There are also third-party extensions -- such as Ghostery and Disconnect -- that help you block cookies and trackers in Chrome.

How to check your iPhone's storage

Your iPhone's Settings can show you what's eating up your storage, whether it's photos, videos, music, or even an app's temporary data. To see a full breakdown of your storage usage, follow these steps:

Go to the iPhone's Settings. Tap on General. Select iPhone Storage. Scroll through to find the app you're looking for. Tap on the app to view storage status and options.

Also: Does your iPhone have enough space? How to find out

Unfortunately, you can't clear a third-party app's cache directly in Settings, but this view gives you a clear breakdown of your storage and lets you delete or offload apps.

How to browse on Safari without creating a history

If you're learning how to clear the cache on an iPhone, you might wonder if there's a way to use Safari without saving any browsing history. Yes! You can turn on Private Browsing by following these steps:

Open Safari. Tap on Tabs. Choose Private.

Did you know that whenever you turn on your smart TV, you invite an unseen guest to watch it with you?

These days, most popular TV models utilize automatic content recognition (ACR), a form of ad surveillance technology that gathers information about everything you watch and transmits it to a centralized database. Manufacturers then use your data to identify your viewing preferences, enabling them to deliver highly targeted ads.

Also: Your TV's USB port is seriously underutilized: 5 features you're not taking advantage of

What's the incentive behind this invasive technology? According to market research firm eMarketer, in 2022, advertisers spent an estimated $18.6 billion on smart TV ads, and those numbers are only going up.

To understand how ACR works, imagine a constant, real-time Shazam-like service running in the background while your TV is on. It identifies content displayed on your screen, including programs from cable TV boxes, streaming services, or gaming consoles. ACR does this by capturing continuous screenshots and cross-referencing them with a vast database of media content and advertisements.

According to The Markup, ACR can capture and identify up to 7,200 images per hour, or approximately two images every second. This extensive tracking offers money-making insights for marketers and content distributors because it can reveal connections between viewers' personal information and their preferred content. By ""personal information,"" I mean email addresses, IP addresses -- and even your physical street address.

By understanding what viewers watch and engage with, marketers can make decisions on content recommendations to create bespoke advertising placements. They can also track advertisements that lead to purchases.

But the most disturbing part is the potential for exploitation. In the wrong hands, sensitive information gathered through ACR could be exploited or misused, which may result in security risks or, at worst, identity theft.

Because ACR operates clandestinely in the background, many of us aren't even aware of its active presence each time we're enjoying our favorite shows. Opting out of using ACR is complex and sometimes challenging. Navigating through your TV settings might take several dozen clicks to protect your privacy better.

If you, like me, perceive this feature to be intrusive or unsettling, there's a way to dismiss this data collection feature on your smart TV. It might take some patience, but below is a How-To list for five major brands demonstrating how to turn off ACR.

How to turn off ACR on a smart TV

For Samsung TVs… Press the Home button on your remote control. Navigate to the left to access the sidebar menu. In the sidebar menu, choose the Privacy Choices option. Select the Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy option. Ensure that the checkbox for Viewing Information Services is unchecked. This will turn off ACR and any associated ad targeting. Select the OK option at the bottom of the screen to confirm your changes. Show more

Also: Your TV's USB port has an underrated benefit that can revitalize an old system - here's how it works

For an LG TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the home screen. Press the Settings button on your remote. In the settings side menu, select the Settings option. Navigate to and select the General option. In the General menu, choose System. Select Additional Settings. In Additional Settings, locate and toggle off the Live Plus option. LG further allows you to limit ad tracking, which can be found in Additional Settings. In the Additional Settings menu, select Advertisement. Toggle on the Limit AD Tracking option. You can also turn off home promotions and content recommendations: In the Additional Settings menu, select Home Settings. Uncheck the Home Promotion option. Uncheck the Content Recommendation option. Show more

For a Sony TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu. Navigate to and select Settings. Choose Initial Setup. Scroll down and select Samba Interactive TV. Select Disable to turn off Samba TV, which is Sony's ACR technology. Sony also allows for enhanced privacy by disabling ad personalization: Go to Settings. Select About. Choose Ads. Turn off Ads Personalization. As an extra step, you can entirely disable the Samba Services Manager, which is embedded in the firmware of certain Sony Bravia TVs as a third-party interactive app. Go to Settings. Select Apps. Select Samba Services Manager. Choose Clear Cache. Select Force Stop. Finally, select Disable. If your Sony TV uses Android TV, you should also turn off data collection for Chromecast: Open the Google Home app on your smartphone. Tap the Menu icon. Select your TV from the list of devices. Tap the three dots in the upper right corner. Choose Settings. Turn off Send Chromecast device usage data and crash reports. Show more

For a Hisense TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu. Navigate to and select Settings. Choose System. Select Privacy. Look for an option called Smart TV Experience, Viewing Information Services, or something similar. Toggle this option off to disable ACR. To disable personalized ads and opt out of content recommendations: In the Privacy menu, look for an option like Ad Tracking or Interest-Based Ads. Turn this option off. Look for options related to content recommendations or personalized content. Disable these features if you don't want the TV to suggest content based on your viewing habits. Show more

For a TCL TV (and other Roku-powered TVs)… Press the Home button on your TCL TV remote control. Navigate to and select Settings in the main menu. Scroll down and select the Privacy option. Look for Smart TV Experience and select it. Uncheck or toggle off the option labeled Use Info from TV Inputs. For extra privacy, TCL TVs offer a few more options, all of which can be found in the Privacy menu: Select Advertising. Choose Limit ad tracking. Again, select Advertising. Uncheck Personalized ads. Now, still in the Privacy menu, select Microphone. Adjust Channel Microphone Access and Channel Permissions as desired. Show more

Remember that while these steps will significantly reduce data collection, they may also limit some smart features of your TV. Also, it's a good idea to periodically check these settings to ensure they remain as you've set them. Especially after software updates, your revised settings may sometimes revert to their default state.

Also: How to clear the cache on your TV (and why it makes such a big difference)

The driving force behind targeted advertisements on smart TVs is ACR technology, and its inclusion speaks volumes about manufacturers' focus on monetizing user data rather than prioritizing consumer interests.

For most of us, ACR offers few tangible benefits, while the real-time sharing of our viewing habits and preferences exposes us to potential privacy risks. By disabling ACR, you can help keep your data to yourself, and enjoy viewing with some peace of mind.",,"Chris Bayer, Aug., At A.M.

On Oct. 14, 2025, Microsoft will stop delivering security updates to your Windows 10 PC unless you enroll that PC in the Extended Security Updates program.

If you try to upgrade to Windows 11 on a PC that's more than five or six years old, you'll probably encounter an error message telling you -- in no uncertain terms -- that your old PC doesn't qualify because its CPU isn't on the official list of compatible processors. Microsoft has stated, forcefully, that it will not revise those requirements. You will also hit roadblocks if your PC doesn't have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 2.0, or if the TPM is not enabled.

Also: Two ways to get free Windows 10 security updates through October 2026

That might be the official policy, but -- as with everything Windows-related -- it pays to read the fine print.

Those pesky restrictions prevent you from automatically upgrading to Windows 11 using Windows Update or the Windows 11 Installation Assistant. Yet, as I detail in ZDNET's Windows 11 FAQ, there are documented workarounds for most PCs that were originally built for Windows 10.

Over the past few years, Microsoft has played a cat-and-mouse game with enthusiasts, adding occasional speed bumps that make it more difficult to bypass these compatibility checks. There are workarounds for most modern PCs, but some older devices, especially those built using AMD processors, might be out of luck. The instructions below take all those developments into account.

Also: Can your old PC handle the Windows 11 upgrade? How to find out - before you try

These instructions also assume that you have a PC running a retail or OEM edition of Windows 10 (Home or Pro) and that you are signed in as an administrator on the PC you want to upgrade.

Which option should you choose?

Please don't skip over this section.

This article describes two upgrade options. To take advantage of the workaround described in option 1 below, your computer must meet all the other requirements for Windows 11.

It must be configured to start up using UEFI, not a legacy BIOS configuration.

Secure Boot must be supported, although it does not need to be enabled. (But seriously, folks, you should enable Secure Boot.)

A TPM must be enabled; version 1.2 is OK, but a system without any TPM or with the TPM disabled will fail. Any PC that was originally designed for Windows 10 should include a TPM 2.0.

To check these details on a PC you're considering upgrading, run the System Information utility, Msinfo32.exe, and look at the System Summary page. Pay special attention to the BIOS Mode value. If it says ""Legacy,"" you'll need to reconfigure your system to UEFI mode (and convert your system disk from MBR to GPT partitioning) before you can install Windows 11 as a normal upgrade.

Also: Why Windows 11 requires a TPM - and how to get around it

To see whether your PC has a TPM enabled, run the Trusted Platform Module Management tool, Tpm.msc. If your computer includes a TPM and it's turned on, this app will display information about it. Under the TPM Manufacturer Information heading, check the specification version to confirm that it is 2.0. If there's no TPM, or if the TPM is disabled in firmware settings, you'll see a message that says ""Compatible TPM cannot be found.""

If you're unable (or unwilling) to change from Legacy BIOS to UEFI, or if you have an older PC that doesn't have a TPM option at all, you'll need to use the second option, which takes advantage of an undocumented hack that allows you to bypass the compatibility checks and complete the upgrade. Skip to the Option 2 section of this post for details on how to use the free Rufus utility to perform this upgrade.

Also: How to install Windows 11 your way (and avoid Microsoft's restrictions)

Finally, note that Microsoft added a new set of restrictions as part of the Windows 11 version 24H2 update. These changes require a CPU that supports specific instructions -- SSE4.2 and PopCnt. Most PCs with Intel CPUs from 2009 or later will meet this standard. AMD CPUs from 2013 or later should also meet these requirements. But it is impossible to upgrade to Windows 11 version 24H2 on a PC that was built in 2008 or earlier. For details, see ""Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This trusty tool can (probably) fix that.""

If you plan to perform a clean installation of Windows 11, you can boot from installation media and run Windows Setup. That option skips the CPU compatibility check completely (but still requires a TPM and Secure Boot support). After the installation completes, you'll need to reinstall all your apps, restore your data files, and tweak settings to personalize your system preferences.

Want to avoid all that hassle? Choose the option that's appropriate for your hardware.

Option 1: Use this simple registry edit

With this registry edit, you can bypass CPU checks and accept any TPM version. Please be aware that this option requires that you run the Setup program from within your current Windows installation. You can't boot from a USB flash drive and install Windows 11 this way.

This process requires four steps.

1. Change one key in the Windows registry You need to make one small change to the Windows registry. For more than three years, this change was documented at Microsoft's support website, but the company removed those instructions in December 2024. (Here's an archived version of that support article.) This change tells the Windows 11 Setup program to skip the check for compatible CPUs and to allow installation on a PC with an older TPM (version 1.2). The usual warnings apply when working with the registry; I recommend you make a complete backup before proceeding. Open Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and navigate to the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup If the MoSetup key doesn't exist, you need to create it. Right-click the node for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup in the left-hand navigation pane, then choose New > Key. Name it MoSetup and press Enter. Also: Wiping your Windows laptop? Here's the simplest way to erase all personal data Select the MoSetup key and then right-click in any empty space in the pane on the right. Choose the option to create a new DWORD value. (Don't choose the QWORD option!) Replace the default name for that key by typing the text AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU and then press Enter. Then double-click the new value and change the ""Value data"" box to 1. The result should look like this: Show more

Use this registry tweak to override the Windows 11 CPU compatibility check. You must have a TPM (any version) and Secure Boot must be enabled. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET

Check for typos before proceeding -- Windows is frustratingly literal about the contents of the registry, and if you misspell the key or value name, your upgrade will fail. Click OK to save your change, and then restart your PC.

2. Download the Windows 11 ISO On the PC you want to upgrade, go to the Windows 11 Download page (aka.ms/DownloadWindows11) and choose the option at the bottom of the page, ""Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices."" Save the ISO file in your Downloads folder. Note that this is a big file. Depending on the speed of your internet connection, the download could take a while. Also: The ultimate Windows 11 upgrade guide: Everything you need to know For those running Windows with English (UK) as the selected language, choose English (United States) when prompted for a product language. Several readers have reported that choosing English International results in an upgrade that does not allow you to keep installed apps and data files. Show more

3. Mount the ISO file in File Explorer After the download completes, open File Explorer and double-click the ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Doing so mounts the file as a virtual DVD drive in its own folder, with its own drive letter. Show more

4. Run Windows Setup In File Explorer, find the Setup.exe file in the virtual drive you opened in the previous step and double-click it to begin the upgrade. You'll see a stern warning about compatibility issues and the possibility that performing an upgrade will mean you are not entitled to future updates. You can safely click Accept to move past this message. (For details on what that warning message really means, see ""Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?"" Spoiler: They are not going to cut off security updates.) After you click OK on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues. If you're upgrading from the same edition (Home or Pro), you'll have three options: You can keep your apps, settings, and files (Full Upgrade); keep your data files but start fresh with apps and settings (Keep Data Only); or start completely fresh (Clean Install). Show more

Option 2: Use the free Rufus utility

On older PCs without a TPM and on PCs that don't support Secure Boot, you'll need to use an undocumented hack to bypass the compatibility checker. You can do this manually by replacing the Appraiserres.dll file (in the Sources subfolder on the Windows 11 installer drive) with a zero-byte version and then making a series of registry edits. But it's simpler to use the free, open-source Rufus utility to create installation media (on a USB flash) drive that includes these tweaks automatically.

To get started, download Rufus version 4.6 or later. Earlier versions won't work, thanks to changes Microsoft made in October 2024 to its compatibility checking tools. For details of how the newer versions work, see ""Microsoft blocked your Windows 11 upgrade? This just-released tool can get the job done."" In addition, be aware that using Rufus will not allow you to bypass the new restrictions on very old PCs that were introduced with Windows 11 version 24H2.

If you have a PC with a CPU that lacks support for SSE4.2 and PopCnt instructions, not even Rufus can help. (Of course, any PC that fails that test is nearly 20 years old and probably deserves to be retired.)

Also: Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it

To get started, you'll need to download the Windows 11 ISO. Be sure to save it to the Downloads folder of your Windows system drive so you can find it easily. You'll also need a USB flash drive of at least 16 GB in size. You will reformat this drive as part of the process, so back up any data on that drive first -- and do not store the Windows 11 ISO here!

Download Rufus from the developer's site from the Microsoft Store Choose the USB drive and then choose the ""Disk or ISO image"" option. Click the Select button, choose the Windows 11 ISO you downloaded earlier, and then click Start. In the Windows User Experience dialog, select the first checkbox to remove hardware requirements, as shown in the screenshot below. Click OK to begin creating the drive.

Be sure to choose the top checkbox here to bypass the compatibility check for the Windows 11 upgrade. Screenshot by Ed Bott/ZDNET

After Rufus successfully creates your installer, open that USB drive in File Explorer, and double-click Setup. Do not try to upgrade by booting from that USB drive and performing a clean install; it won't work.

As is the case with the other option, you'll see a warning about compatibility issues. It's a scare tactic. (For details on what the language in that warning message actually means, see ""Is Microsoft really going to cut off security updates for your 'unsupported' Windows 11 PC?"") After you click Accept on that dialog box, your upgrade should proceed without any serious issues.

In the age of smart TVs, convenience is king. With just a few clicks, we can dive into endless entertainment -- but that ease comes with a downside: the buildup of cache data.

Just like on your phone or computer, a cluttered TV cache can lead to sluggish performance, app crashes, and even hinder new content from loading properly. That's why it's important to clear all that extra cache and make your TV feel like new again. Before I break down the steps for how to do it, let's address the big elephant in the room first.

What is a cache?

A cache is a temporary storage area where data is kept for quick access. On your smart TV, the cache stores information from apps, websites, and system processes to help them load faster every time you turn it on. Think of it as a bunch of temporary files intended to speed up loading times for frequently accessed information.

For instance, when you open a streaming app, the cache might store thumbnails, login details, or recently watched shows. Caches are designed to help your TV load this content more quickly. Over time, however, the cache can become overloaded with outdated or unnecessary data, which can consequently slow down your TV's performance.

Why should you clear your TV's cache?

You should consider clearing your TV's cache for two main reasons. First, it can improve performance. A bloated cache can slow down your TV's processing, leading to sluggish navigation, delayed app launches, and buffering issues. Clearing the cache frees up space and allows your TV to run more efficiently.

Second, clearing the cache can resolve app-specific problems. If you're experiencing issues like crashes, login errors, or unexpected behavior within a particular app, clearing the cache for that specific app can often be the fix.

The process of clearing your TV's cache will vary depending on the brand and model you own, although the general steps are usually quite similar across brands. Most TVs will have a settings menu where you can navigate to an ""Apps"" section. Here, you should find a list of all downloaded applications. Selecting an individual app will often reveal options to ""Clear Cache"" or ""Clear Data."" Clearing the cache will remove temporary files, while clearing data will erase all app information, requiring you to log in again.

It's generally recommended to start with clearing the cache and only resort to clearing data if the problem persists.

If you're unsure about the specific steps for your TV, a quick online search for your model and ""clear cache"" should provide you with detailed instructions. Most manufacturers also offer user manuals or online support resources that can guide you through the process.

Clearing your TV's cache can offer several benefits:

Improved performance: Over time, cached data can accumulate and slow down your TV's operations. Increased storage space: Clearing the cache frees up valuable storage space on your TV. Resolved app issues: Sometimes, apps may malfunction due to corrupted cached data. Clearing the cache can often fix these problems. Enhanced privacy: Cached data may contain personal information, so regular clearing can help protect your privacy.

How do I clear the cache on my TV?

The process of clearing your TV's cache can vary depending on the brand and model. However, here's a general guide that applies to many smart TVs:

Access the Settings menu on your TV. Navigate to the Apps or Application Manager section. Select the app for which you want to clear the cache. Look for an option that says ""Clear Cache"" and select it.

Below is a list of specific cache-clearing instructions for some leading brands.

For Samsung TVs:

Go to Settings > Support > Device Care Select ""Manage Storage"" Choose the app you want to clear the cache for and select ""View Details"" Select ""Clear Cache""

For LG TVs:

Press the Home button on your remote Go to Settings > General > Storage Select ""Clear Cache""

For Android/Google TVs (including Sony models):

Go to Settings > Apps Select ""See all apps"" Choose the app you want to clear the cache for Select ""Clear Cache""

For Roku TVs:

Roku TVs don't have a built-in cache-clearing option, but you can achieve similar results by restarting the TV or removing and reinstalling problematic apps.

Also: Is your Roku TV spying on you? Likely, but here's how you can take back control

Some key points to note:

The exact menu names and options may vary slightly between TV models and software versions.

You may need to clear the cache for individual apps rather than the entire system on some TVs.

Clearing your cache is generally safe and won't delete important data, but clearing app data may reset some settings.

Be sure to consult your TV's user manual for model-specific instructions, as the process can differ between brands and even between models of the same brand.

When should you clear your TV's cache?

While there's no strict rule, it's a good practice to clear your TV's cache every few months or when you notice:

Your TV is running slower than usual.

Apps are frequently crashing or not loading properly.

You're running low on storage space.

Also: Can't hear TV dialogue? Changing these 3 settings can make a big difference

Taking a few minutes to clear your cache is a simple yet often overlooked task that can improve your smart TV's performance and ensure a smooth viewing experience. By making this a regular part of your TV maintenance routine, you can enjoy faster load times, more stable app performance, and potentially even extend the life of your device. With a clean slate, your TV can operate smoother, apps can function properly, and you can get back to enjoying your favorite content without any frustrating glitches.",,"Chris Bayer, Aug., At A.M.

Why is F1 better than NASCAR?

I mean, no offense.

I like NASCAR a lot.

We didn't say that.

That's what you put in our mouths.

Hey Wired, we are Formula 1 drivers.

Let's answer the most Googled questions about F1.

[upbeat music]

Okay guys, we're ready? We're ready.

First question.

When did F1 first start?

1950, at Silverstone. 1950.

It was called the Grand Prix de Europe,

because, I don't know, the FIA was French

I think at the time.

Ah, yeah, true.

There were the FIA back then?

Okay.

Why do F1 drivers train their neck?

Because we are strapped down

with our whole body except the neck.

So our head is the only thing that can really move.

Honestly, nothing beats just driving.

I don't train the neck.

You don't do it at all, do you?

What, off season?

Never.

Then how do you do the first test?

I arrive to a first test.

I die one day and.

Then you're fine.

Really?

It's the endurance which is hard to reproduce, basically.

So, we can get the strength in the gym,

but you can't hold, you know, your neck for an hour.

Do some F1 tracks have more physical impact

on you than others?

Yes. Yes.

Yes.

Well, the most one, Singapore,

I think we agree, Singapore is.

Yeah. Qatar.

Qatar 23.

There's two tracks.

Qatar and Singapore.

I think the sun board is underrated.

How much time is an F1 race?

That's such an easy question.

It's one hour 40.

But depends on which race.

Exactly.

Okay, Monaco is 1 50.

Four days long, the race.

Why do I find drivers drive zig-zag?

To heat. To warm up the tires.

The tires up.

Drive zig-zig.

[driver laughs]

Putting energy on your tires, turning right.

You can imagine in a straight line

you don't got any energy on the sides of the tires.

So when you do zig-zags, you're loading,

you're, you're, you're,

you're stretching the sides of the tires.

Why does a tire have more grip, Alex?

When it's warm.

And they're round and they're smooth.

'Cause they are not smooth.

Are F1 cars manual?

Kind of.

You respond to this.

For sure they're not automatic in terms of,

we need to drive them.

We don't clutch or anything to shift.

It's like your tiptronic car

that you can put in sport mode.

We are drivers.

We are Formula 1 drivers.

There's no H pattern there.

Clutch for first gear and then all up full throttle.

Can F1 cars reverse?

Yes they can.

It's a bit more difficult than my Alfa Romeo road car.

Yes.

You can't see, that's the problem.

There's no reversing camera.

The mirrors are very hard to see as well.

See the problem is when you need to use reverse,

you're in panic mode because that means you've.

Done something wrong. Done something wrong.

So you always are like trying to find reverse.

And it's a simple way of finding reverse,

but it takes five, five seconds to find it more or less.

But it's precious time.

Why do F1 cars have the halo?

To protect our heads. The head.

Looks like a flip flop.

Yeah. Yes.

It protects from car going,

it can happen, a car.

It can happen.

It has happened.

Yeah, it has happened.

A car going into your head like on your side

and it's very, very resistant.

I don't like this question.

No, you go read it, what is it?

Why is F1 better than NASCAR?

I mean, no offense.

I like NASCAR a lot. Me too.

Me too.

We didn't say that.

That's, that's what you put in our mouths.

Yeah, I, I think it's just different.

We can't take as many curbs as NASCAR.

I would love to take like the last chicane in Canada.

Imagine if we're in NASCAR.

Well you make it a straight line.

Yeah.

My only reason why I would say F1 is better than NASCAR

is because it's way faster.

And faster, for me, the better.

But I respect NASCAR drivers and what they do

and I think it's a great motor sport to watch also.

Can F1 drivers see behind them?

Yes, we can.

We have two very small mirrors.

That vibrate a lot.

That vibrates a lot

And it's vibrates so much that you see sometimes

five cars in the same spot.

But it's the same car.

It's the same car just doing this.

Who is the Formula 1 movie about?

Retired Formula 1 driver, Sonny Hayes,

comes back to an American team.

But he was never in F1.

Yeah, he was in F1. He was, he was, he was.

In the beginning.

Had a big crash, yeah.

He had a massive shunt.

Okay, spoiler.

So he comes back to Formula 1

to help American team Apex GP

to get to be successful in Formula 1.

Try and hit the screen. Whoa.

Nearly killed someone.

What g-force do F1 drivers experience?

Depends if you crash or not.

It can be like 50 if you have a big shunt.

A normal race, I guess like five,

maybe six in breaking.

Sustained. Peak.

Yeah. Peak.

Because peak is six in breaking and the sustained five in.

Corners.

Turn three in Barcelona, maybe.

Maybe six for McLaren.

But biggest crash I've had is 46 G.

Any big crashes?

Never had one. The Miami one.

That hurt.

I had it the year before.

In the concrete, no?

I peed red the following day.

Oh. That's a nice.

Wow. That's disgusting.

Yeah, sorry guys.

I was like, is that what he said or, wow.

Yeah, yeah. Why?

It was a high impact, yeah I don't know.

Do F1 drivers ever think about anything other

than the race during the race?

Yes, we definitely do.

If it's a very boring race.

The party afterwards.

How slow can I go?

I did a challenge in Monaco to try and do a full lap

without doing full throttle.

Oh my god.

And I managed it.

I didn't lose any time actually.

Lots of focus.

[drivers laugh]

Reaction time.

F1 drivers don't fight.

Do F1 drivers drive with both feet?

It's right foot break.

Yes.

No you don't actually, right foot break.

No.

I break right foot.

No, he's kidding.

You almost believe me.

No, we, we, we drive with both feet.

So right foot is the throttle, left the break,

and the clutch is on the hands.

So it's just for first gear, when we pull out the garage

or we do the race start,

otherwise we don't need to use the clutch.

Thanks.

When does the F1 season start?

Late February, start of March.

What fuel do F1 cars use?

I have no idea.

Petrol?

No, it's 10% ethanol and the rest is the race fuel

that's our providers basically.

But it's like super 98, no equivalent.

Super 98. No it's a hundred.

It's gotta be more than 98. It's 110 octane.

Yeah. Really?

So the ethanol is 114 and then we have a bit less.

I had no idea.

What's are F1 drivers' favorite circuits?

Can we all agree it's Suzuka?

Yes. Yes.

Yeah, agree.

Suzuka's pretty cool, yeah.

Can we all agree the next one might be?

Monaco.

Monaco is up there.

Monaco?

On the quarter lap?

No quarter lap, Alex.

I like Austin.

I love Austin.

Suzuka narrow, I would say.

You feel like there's a chance to crash

which gives you the adrenaline.

No the risk and reward, I would say.

Yeah, when you finish a lap

and your heart rates like this,

that's a good track.

Are F1 cars all the same?

Yes.

Completely the same.

They're close enough so we can compete,

but then they're all completely.

Yes. Yes.

Every team makes their own car.

And we are currently in the year

of the closest ever year in F1.

I think all cars are within eight tenths of each other.

Eight tenths is that after a lap,

I could do a lap in a Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull,

and then I jump in another car and I go eight tenths slower.

Between first and last is.

Between first and last.

Yeah, is eight tenths

Quite impressive.

But what people need to know is that

between F1 drivers there's no more than two or three tenths.

So those eight tens are, is still quite a lot.

Which F1 car is the fastest?

McLaren is the fastest.

Everyone agrees, right?

Yes.

It's quite close.

This year's McLaren to the 2020 Mercedes actually.

Why is Formula 1 called Formula 1?

Because it's about formula two and three and four.

No, I think the way a car is built is a formula.

It's number one formula.

You know what I mean?

It's a good point, yeah.

So it's a formula of things.

And it's the first one.

It's the top one.

It's the number one.

Number one. Yeah.

Why are F1 tires smooth?

I think they mean why are they sleek?

I'm thinking of it literally like why they're not square.

[drivers laugh]

To offer the highest level of grip available for the tire.

Yes, yes.

If you put your hand like that,

it's not gonna grip much.

If you put it like this, it grips more.

[driver laughs]

What F1 drivers are in the F1 movie?

You. All of us.

I'm not in the movie.

Yes, you are in the title at the end.

At the title, in the credits?

I've seen you in the credits.

Carlos is clearly the one featured the most.

He has, he has a whole sentence.

Yeah, he does. Yeah.

Dude. It's a great scene.

Spoiler alert.

Those are all the questions.

Thanks for watching.

I'm Stephen Vladeck,

author and professor at Georgetown University Law Center.

I'm here today to answer your questions from the internet.

This is Supreme Court Support.

[lively music]

@Cryptoking asks,

Why do Supreme Court justices receive life appointments

while every other type of judge has retirement ages?

So this is actually a real disconnect

between the federal courts and state courts.

Most states have imposed retirement ages

on their judges and justices.

The federal courts have not.

And so under Article III of the Federal Constitution,

the Supreme Court,

the intermediate federal courts of appeals,

the 94 federal district courts, all of them served

during what the Constitution calls good behavior.

And the idea here was to provide a modicum

of protection against being forced off the bench

for anything other than the kind of misconduct

that might warrant impeachment

by the House of Representatives and removal by the Senate.

@kpolaprateek asks,

So how do Supreme Court justices get appointed?

The appointments process is actually pretty straightforward.

The president gets to nominate anyone,

doesn't matter how old they are, where they're from,

what their qualifications are,

to be a Supreme Court justice,

and as long as they're confirmed

by a majority of the Senate, they got the job.

VAWNavyVet asks, Are confirmation hearings effective

in preventing unqualified appointments

or have they become mere formalities?

You know, this really does vary

and has varied historically based upon who the President is

and based upon which party controls the Senate.

There have been moments in American history

where the Senate really has exercised

a rigorous oversight role.

In vetting the Supreme Court's nominees,

there have been some who have been blocked by the Senate,

some who were withdrawn

'cause they didn't have the votes in the Senate.

But I think what we've seen lately

is when the presidents of the same party

as a majority of the Senate, there really is a push

to get through the President's nominees.

And so I think we've seen less of that criticism

from the Senate in recent nomination processes.

Professional_Cat_437, Could somebody explain

what the 2016 drama of Obama being unable

to appoint a new Supreme Court justice was?

So in February of 2016, Justice Antonin Scalia,

who was in many respects the leader

of the court's then extinct four conservative justice wing

unexpectedly passed away while he was on the court,

opening up a seat for President Obama to presumably fill.

President Obama quickly nominated an incredibly moderate

and relatively older candidates,

then DC Circuit Judge Merrick Garland, but the Republicans

who at the time had a majority in the Senate banded together

and committed to provide no process,

not even to have a vote up or down

on Merrick Garland as a nominee,

but rather to keep that seat open

through the November, 2016 presidential election

until President Trump was sworn in in January,

at which point he nominated Neil Gorsuch

and the Senate confirmed Gorsuch to fill that seat.

So the Constitution does not require the Senate to vote.

Really historically, the expectation has been

that if the Senate were going to shirk its duty

in such a shameless and transparent way,

it would face political consequences for doing so.

If anything, in 2016, the opposite happened

where the Senate holding that seat open

provided a number of folks

who might not otherwise have wanted to

with reasons to vote for President Trump.

It's also worth keeping in mind

that when the Constitution was written,

we didn't have political parties.

Had the founders known that we were gonna have

really a deeply entrenched two party system,

it's not hard to imagine

they would've done some things very differently.

@DannyjeGga asks, The Supreme Court is not apolitical.

Has it ever been?

We should distinguish here between a court that is political

and the court that is partisan.

The Supreme Court has always been political

in the sense that it's always been involved

in institutional conversations

with the other branches of government.

Some of the court's most important early decisions

come as part of a pretty sophisticated

inner branch conversation

with President Jefferson with Congress.

It's only since 2010 that we have a Supreme Court

where every justices' ideology

aligns with the party of the President who appointed them.

That's part of why today the court

seems so much more divided along partisan lines

than was true as recently as 20 years ago.

From Reddit, How does the process

of a court case going to the Supreme Court work?

Just about every case the Supreme Court hears

has gone through multiple levels

of litigation in lower courts.

Those lower courts could be lower federal courts

or they could be state courts.

And under both the Constitution

and the relevant statutes Congress has passed,

once the case has gone through those lower courts,

the Supreme Court has the power to hear an appeal

if whoever lost in the lower courts

wants the court to do so.

And if it's coming from a lower state court,

as long as there's a federal issue in the case,

as long as the case turns on federal law,

the Supreme Court has the power to hear it.

This is actually a place where the Supreme Court's power

and its docket has actually shifted a lot over time.

So from 1789 when the Supreme Court was created until 1891,

the Supreme Court actually had to hear every single appeal

that Congress told it to.

It's only since 1891

that Congress has broadly given the justices

the power to pick and choose

almost all of the cases they hear.

That process is given this Latin term certiorari,

which we abbreviate to cert 'cause we can't really spell it,

and the basic gist is the Supreme Court votes

and it takes four of the nine justices

to agree to hear a case for the court to take it up.

What that means, perhaps, surprisingly,

is that actually almost all of the cases

the Supreme Court decides these days

are cases that the justices have specifically chosen to hear

and not just cases that were foisted upon them.

@CS_Westbrook asks, Do you know approximately

how many cases the Supreme Court takes every year?

The Supreme Court receives

somewhere between 4,500 and 6,000 requests every year

to hear appeals, whether from the lower federal courts

or from the state courts.

It only takes about 65 or 70 of them.

What that means is that in 98 to 99% of those cases,

it's actually those lower courts that get the last word

and the justices leave those lower court decisions intact.

So the process the Supreme Court follows

for picking and choosing cases is very secretive,

but basically the parties file briefs

where the party that wants the Supreme Court

to hear the case says, Here's why you should take it.

The party that one below says,

No, here's why you shouldn't take it.

And the justices and their clerks debate internally

what to do and they ultimately vote,

should we hear this case or not?

@KenHicken asks, Yes or no.

Can the Supreme Court be expanded?

Yes, the Constitution does not provide any limit

on the size of the Supreme Court.

It gives that power to Congress.

Congress used that power a number of times between 1789

and 1869 to change the size of the Supreme Court.

It's really a question about politics,

whether it's a good idea and whether there are the votes.

And at least since 1869, the answer to one,

if not both of those questions, has consistently been no.

An anonymous Reddit user asks,

What's the purpose of dissenting opinions?

Sometimes a justice will write a dissenting opinion

to make clear to their colleagues

just how wrong they think the majority is.

Indeed, we have examples of a proposed dissenting opinion,

actually persuaded enough justices that it's correct

that it became the majority opinion.

Sometimes the goal of a dissenting opinion

is to lay down a marker so that even if the Supreme Court's

not gonna reach the right answer, maybe other actors can.

A famous example of this is when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg

wrote a dissent in a case called Ledbetter about pay equity

that called on Congress to fix the relevant federal statutes

with regard to pay equity in the workplace.

Congress did and it actually passed a statute

called the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act

in response to justice Ginsburg's dissenting opinion.

And sometimes dissents really are meant more for the public

where the dissenting justice understands

that they don't have enough votes

for their position on the court,

but they're writing for posterity.

They think that one day the law will catch up with them.

And some of the great examples of this

are from Justice John Marshall Harlan,

who dissented in cases like Plessy versus Ferguson,

which established the principle of separate but equal

in a way that actually we now rely upon

that has largely become the law of the land.

@real_miss_kim asks,

Which Supreme Court Justice retires next?

And who replaces him or her?

So if history has taught us anything,

it's that it's not always who you'd expect.

I think for obvious reasons,

most of the attention right now

is on justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito

since they are two of the three longest serving

Republican appointed justices on the court

and the ones who I think would be most willing

to have President Trump pick their successors.

But Justice Thomas is also just a couple years away

from the all time longevity record.

For Supreme Court justice

is something I suspect he's interested in.

If you really forced me to bet,

I would say Justice Alito is probably at the top of the list

for the next justice to retire.

But, you know, I'm glad

I don't have to put any real money on it.

Weary-Farmer-4894 asks, Did RBG destroy her legacy

by not retiring during Obama's presidency?

You know, this is a real debate,

not just about Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

but about what a Supreme Court justice's

central obligations are.

Famously, Justice Ginsburg did not retire

when President Obama was in office

and Democrats controlled the Senate.

And that meant that when she passed away

after a long battle with cancer, in September, 2020,

it was President Trump who was able to fill her seat

as he did with Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

I think it's really tricky to think about this question

because retiring solely for partisan political purposes,

even if it's something that justices do,

is maybe not in the best long-term interest

of the institution.

If we view the court through the lens

of just who controls which seats,

then we really are accepting the premise

that the court is a partisan institution

and not just a judicial one.

At the same time,

justices who care about their legacies have to care,

especially in this day and age,

about those partisan politics.

Only a justice knows their body,

only a justice knows their mind,

but I think it certainly looks in retrospect

like it probably would've been better for Justice Ginsburg

if she cared about such things,

to step down when President Obama

could have chosen her successor instead of President Trump.

@PoBoyReeves asks,

How ugly was the Kavanaugh confirmation?

It was pretty ugly.

There were seemingly quite plausible charges

of sexual misconduct on the part

of a much, much younger Brett Kavanaugh.

You had a rushed FBI report

and you had I think a fair amount of railroading

on both sides to the fight

over who would replace justice Anthony Kennedy.

And then we have to remember that part

of what was going on there, was you had the Justice

who had become the median vote on the court.

It was his seat that was at issue,

and I think that's part of why

you saw the emotions get so high.

How do we fix that?

Well, I think this is a larger

and deeper conversation about our institutions

and about pushing presidents, pushing senators,

pushing everybody to a point

where we view the courts in general

and the Supreme Court in particular

as a critically important check

on the other branches of government,

a check where we're gonna want judges and justices

not just who believe things we agree with,

but who are going to assert the power of the courts

over the other branches of government.

That to me is the real unfortunate consequence

of the Kavanaugh confirmation, is that if anything

that's moved us more into our political corners

and not more toward

that kind of institutional understanding.

@theylove_sierra, How did Plessy versus Ferguson

change law and society?

So Plessy versus Ferguson is the infamous 1896 decision

in which the Supreme Court articulated the separate

but equal understanding

for racial discrimination in public places.

You can draw a straight line from Plessy versus Ferguson

to the era of Jim Crow, to the idea

that you would have segregated drinking facilities,

segregated schools, segregated bathrooms

in cities and jurisdictions,

especially throughout the south.

I think there's a debate

about just how much Plessy itself caused those changes

or how much Plessy at least meant the courts

had no way to stop those changes,

which in many respects were already well underway.

Indeed, it wouldn't be

until Brown versus Board of Education in 1954

and the Civil Rights Movement

that Brown was an early part of

that you really see efforts to push back against

to dismantle Jim Crow.

The Supreme Court's obviously part of that story.

It's probably a little much to say

that the court was solely responsible for it.

@SteveO2385 asks, When did the left

ever have control of SCOTUS?

Seriously, when was the last time

there was a liberal majority?

So I think there's actually some debate about this

because until 2010, you had a long history

of Supreme Court appointments

that were not necessarily party and ideology aligned.

For example, Justice William Brennan, who for a long time

was the liberal lion of the Warren Court,

was appointed by a Republican president,

by Dwight Eisenhower.

The last time that a majority of the Supreme Court

included justices appointed by Democratic presidents,

which might be one way to think about this question,

was May 14th, 1969.

That was the day on which Justice Abe Fortas

resigned from the court.

Actually Republican presidents

would have the next 11 appointments to the Supreme Court,

which is a big part

of why there was such this profound shift

in the court's jurisprudence started in 1970.

Reddit user asked, At the time of Roe versus Wade,

was the Supreme Court overwhelmingly liberal?

Not necessarily.

I mean, the Supreme Court in 1973

when Roe versus Wade was decided

was in some respects a court in transition.

And so you had a seven to two majority in that case,

but there were multiple justices in the majority

who had been appointed by Republican presidents,

and one of the two dissenters, Justice Byron White,

was actually a democratic appointee.

He was appointed by President John F. Kennedy.

At the time Roe versus Wade was decided,

the question of the constitutionality

of protections for abortion

just didn't quite divide us so strictly

into ideological camps

as it came to in the years and decades to follow.

@koreflautas asks,

How did Citizens United affect elections?

So the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United

is actually part of a larger series of decisions

in which the Supreme Court

has interpreted the First Amendment

to prohibit a number of restrictions on campaign finance

and to prohibit a number

of campaign finance reform initiatives enacted by Congress.

The result has been a much larger amount

of dark money in our elections, local elections,

state elections, federal elections.

The real impact here

is not that it's obviously pro-Republican or pro-Democratic.

It's pro-money.

Money interests have had much more say

in our elections in the last 15 or 20 years.

Certainly then was true for a long time before that.

@jsc1835 asks, Trump is asking the Supreme Court

to partly allow birthright citizenship restrictions.

Will the Supreme Court allow this

breach of the Constitution?

This is getting a bit into the weeds,

but one of the things that's really tricky

about the three birthright citizenship cases

that the Supreme Court is deciding during its current term

is that the court is being asked not to uphold the policy

but rather just to let it go into effect

as applied to at least some people

through a procedural debate.

Basically the argument is the lower courts ruled too broadly

in blocking President Trump's efforts

to limit birthright citizenship.

I suspect that the court is going to narrow

those lower court rulings in at least some way,

but also that either the Supreme Court

or the lower courts pretty quickly

are gonna reach the end of this case

and rule conclusively that the president's efforts

to limit birthright citizenship are in fact unlawful,

which will mitigate the effect of a procedural ruling

that makes those lower court decisions less effective.

@julietfes asks, In the country's history,

has a Supreme Court justice ever resigned?

So a number have resigned.

Perhaps the most notorious resignation was in 1969

when Justice Abe Fortas resigned

because of alleged improprieties

with a financier named Louis Wolfson.

But there actually have been a number of justices

who have resigned for other reasons, for health reasons,

for personal reasons, in some cases

because they wanted or were appointed to different jobs.

It's really only in the last 10 or 15 years

that we've seen high profile deaths by sitting justices.

We actually had gone a very long time.

From 1954 to 2005,

there wasn't a single justice who died on the bench.

The norm had become resigned before.

The actuarial tables catch up with you.

@thedrivein47 asks,

What are the duties of the chief justice?

So the chief justice is in some respects

the first among equals.

He doesn't have special extra powers

that the other eight justices lack.

What makes him special is he is the senior justice.

He basically presides over all of the court sessions.

He gets to decide whenever he's in the majority

who's gonna write the decision for the court.

And he is in various respects the ceremonial figurehead

of the judicial branch

as set out in Article III of the Constitution.

But when the justices are in their conference room

and they're voting on cases,

the chief justice really is just one of nine.

@christo53294495 ask, Can you tell me in US history

which president has appointed a justice

representing the opposite of his beliefs?

Perhaps the most famous of these is President Eisenhower

appointing Justice William Brennan in 1956,

is a Catholic democratic state court judge from New Jersey,

not because of his ideology, but perhaps despite it.

But in general, I mean, really until the 1950s and 1960s,

there are a lot of examples throughout American history

of president's prioritizing geographical diversity,

other types of experience,

of presidents cashing in political chips,

or even in some cases of presidents

using Supreme Court appointments

to neutralize the folks they were, you know, rivals with.

It's really only in the last generation

that we've come to think of Supreme Court appointments

as being purely about maximizing ideology.

A Reddit user asks,

Why did LBJ nominate Thurgood Marshall?

Justice Marshall, when he was nominated

to the court in 1967, was the first justice

in the court's history who was not white,

and this was a really important step by President Johnson.

President thought it was long past time

that the Supreme Court have a Black justice.

Indeed, he actually manipulates the circumstances

just to create a seat for Justice Marshall.

He took Ramsey Clark, who was the son

of a sitting Supreme Court Justice Tom Clark,

and he appointed Ramsey Clark as the Attorney General.

That would have meant Tom Clark would've had to recuse

from every case in which the federal government was a party.

LBJ knew he wouldn't do that.

LBJ knew that Tom Clark would resign from the court,

thereby creating the seat for Thurgood Marshall.

@punycitizen asks, How does the shadow docket work?

The shadow docket is a term that was coined

by a University of Chicago law professor Will Baude in 2015,

and it was meant to describe everything

that the Supreme Court does other than the 65 or so cases.

It decides after briefing an argument every year.

So that includes all of the rulings

where the Supreme Court declines to take up an appeal

and it includes this other chunk of decisions

where the Supreme Court is asked

to provide something called emergency relief.

Emergency relief is when you have a case in the lower courts

that has not gotten to the Supreme Court yet,

but one party, presumably whoever lost below,

wants to change the status quo

while the case works its way to the Supreme Court.

And that's become an increasingly prominent part

of the Supreme Court's workload.

It's why the shadow docket has become so much more,

I think, a subject of popular interest,

especially as we've seen

during the second Trump administration,

so many cases where the federal government

is asking the Supreme Court

to temporarily pause lower court rulings

blocking various policies

while those cases worked their way through the courts.

A Reddit user asked,

What was the first Second Amendment Supreme Court case?

Really, the first time the Supreme Court

discussed the Second Amendment in detail was in the 1930s

in a case called Miller where the court basically said

that the Second Amendment

didn't protect an individual right to self-defense.

It was mostly a collective right

to resist tyrannical government.

Of course, it was that understanding

that the Supreme Court overruled.

In 2008, since the Supreme Court's decision

in its five four decision in Heller,

what we've seen is a lot more litigation challenging

and succeeding in striking down limits on gun sales,

gun possession across the country.

yukicola asks, What do the US Supreme Court justices

actually do during a regular workday?

Most of the justices work goes on in their chambers.

In the Supreme Court's official headquarters in Washington,

a building, by the way, the court has only had since 1935,

the justices each have their own chambers,

they have their own staffs, they have four law clerks

who are recent law school graduates,

and of course they have administrative support as well.

And most of what they're doing is reviewing cases,

either which cases they're going to choose to hear or not,

or in the subset of cases the justices have chosen to hear,

reading the briefs, preparing for argument,

writing opinions, reviewing other justices' opinions.

The justices really only gather in person formally

when they're on the hearing arguments

or handing down decisions

or when they are back in what's called their conference,

where they decide how they're gonna rule on specific cases.

BlanckToHideFromWife,

Can the US Supreme Court in practice make law?

This has been really a bit of a metaphysical debate

among scholars for a very long time.

Everyone agrees that judges

and the Supreme Court in particular

have a responsibility to interpret the law.

The difference between that

and what we might call making law is often elusive.

And actually there are contexts in which we expect judges

to do more than just resolve ambiguity,

perhaps to fill in language that Congress

or the state legislature has left out.

So yes, I mean I think there are lots of contexts

in which the judges and justices

are and should be allowed to make law.

We just tend to think of those in the context

of interpreting statutes, constitutional provisions,

and other legal texts.

Hagisman asks, Ideally, should the Supreme Court

lean toward originalism or living constitutionalism?

This is an age old debate about how judges and justices

should interpret the text of the Constitution

when that text is ambiguous.

No one really disputes that when the Constitution

says the President has to be 35 years old, it means 35.

But when the Eighth Amendment says something

like there can be no such thing as cruel

and unusual punishment, that of course raises questions.

What makes a particular punishment cruel and unusual?

Throughout the court's history,

one of the ways we've addressed this issue

is by having justices who were diverse,

who were from different parts of the country,

who are from different backgrounds,

who had different methodological commitments.

And it's really only in the last generation

that there has been this concerted push toward the idea

that there really can only be one accepted way

to interpret the Constitution.

I'll just say that I think the better answer

is different people are gonna have different commitments

based upon their own views, their own experiences,

their own background,

and part of why we have nine Supreme Court justices

and not just one, part of why we have humans

interpreting these texts and not machines,

is because those differences,

that diversity is actually a really important part

of the project of legal interpretation.

@DJvsEverybody asks, How do state's rights

fit into having the Supreme Court

have the ability to overrule state courts?

The Constitution divides sovereignty

between the federal government and the states.

One of the ways it does so

is it leaves questions of state law

up to state Supreme Court.

So if the Missouri Supreme Court

interprets Missouri law in a particular way,

the Supreme Court has no power to disagree with them.

The difference is when it's about federal law.

And so if a state court interprets a federal statute

or the federal constitution

or if a state court interprets state law

in a way that is inconsistent with federal law

or the federal constitution,

that's where the US Supreme Court is able to come in

and is able to reverse that decision.

amwreck asks, How does the Supreme Court

go about overturning a previous ruling?

It's actually not that complicated procedurally.

It's just fraught in the sense

that it tends to be controversial

when the Supreme Court overturns a prior decision.

There's nothing that actually prevents any justices

in any case from saying,

Hey, we actually think this prior decision is wrong

and should be overruled.

You need a majority, of course,

and presumably you need some compelling reason

why that older decision should be overruled.

The principle of stare decisis is the idea

that all things being equal,

court should follow the decisions of their predecessors.

If and when there are especially persuasive reasons

to overrule a prior precedent,

that's when the court is I think more free to do so.

kwertix asks, Why does the US Supreme Court

rely on presidential cases?

This isn't just the US Supreme Court.

This is actually a feature

of any so-called common law legal system.

And the idea is that precedent is itself part of our law,

that what separates judges

and justices from ordinary politicians

is that they're not just voting their preferences

in every individual case,

that there is actually this abstract idea of what the law is

that binds not just current judges but future judges

until and unless there's some compelling reason

to overrule it.

That's not just a sort of principle of laziness.

It's actually a really important foundation

of what separates judicial power

from ordinary political power.

@Andrevin20, Do I think the Supreme Court

was always nine seats?

How did it get to nine?

In fact, I know it wasn't.

The Constitution itself says nothing

about how big the Supreme Court ought to be.

Congress, when it created the court in 1789,

started with a very strange number with six.

That was really based

on how many lower appeals courts there were.

Between 1789 and 1869,

the size of the court fluctuates seven times

between as many as 10 justices

for a brief period in the 1860s

and at one point as few as five justices.

It's only in April of 1869

that Congress for the first time hardwires the number nine

into the identity of the Supreme Court

and we've been set at nine ever since.

There have been proposals at various points

in the recent past,

especially during the Biden administration,

to pack the court by adding perhaps four seats.

Practically, you're never gonna be able to do it

unless the same party simultaneously controls

not just the White House, but both chambers of Congress

and has a filibuster proof majority in the Senate.

And in the long-term,

I mean, if you're expanding the court solely

to maximize short-term partisan political advantage,

I think that probably re-downs to the detriment

of the integrity of the court, of public faith in the court,

even if part of why folks are proposing that as a reform

is because they think that damage has already happened.

I'm not sure this is an example

of two wrongs making the right.

@myopinion6810 asks,

How do Supreme Court justices get impeached?

Has that ever happened?

So it's the exact same process in the Constitution

for impeaching a Supreme Court justice

as it is for the President.

It takes a majority

of the House of Representatives to impeach,

two-thirds of the Senate to vote to convict

and thereby remove.

It's happened exactly once with the Supreme Court Justice.

In 1804, the sort of Jeffersonian controlled Congress

impeached and tried to remove Justice Samuel Chase,

who has perhaps the greatest nickname

in Supreme Court history.

He was known as Old Bacon Face.

And Justice Chase was impeached because the Jeffersonians

thought that he was basically a partisan hack.

But the Senate refused to remove Justice Chase.

It wasn't that they decided that he was not a partisan.

It was that they decided that wasn't enough,

and that to remove a Supreme Court justice,

you need actual misconduct.

And that's really stood as a pretty important precedent

for judicial independence ever since.

Odd-Flower2744, What actually happens

if Supreme Court decisions are just ignored?

What mechanisms actually enforce a Supreme Court decision?

It depends on who's doing the ignoring.

Of course, if it's private parties, there are lots of ways

to compel their obedience to Supreme Court decisions,

whether it's monetary sanctions or otherwise.

It is, of course, trickier

if the relevant party is the federal government.

Historically, the way the Supreme Court has been allowed to,

been able to effectuate its mandates

is because the political consequences

of a president defy on the Supreme Court

have just been too high.

President Nixon turned over the Watergate tapes,

including the tape that led directly to his resignation

because he concluded with the support of his advisors

that he couldn't defy the Supreme Court.

President Eisenhower sent the army into Little Rock in 1957

to desegregate Central High School

because he was persuaded

that he couldn't not enforce the Supreme Court decision

in Brown versus Board of Education.

That's why the Supreme Court's legitimacy

why public faith in the court is so important

because if we get to a point where a president

could stick his thumb in the Supreme Court's eye

and have no similar political backlash,

that would be the point where the Supreme Court's power

as an institution would be critically

and perhaps irrevocably damaged.

@ajebolawyer asks, Do I know the difference

between the Supreme Court of a state of the United States

and the Supreme Court of the United States?

In fact, I do. So every state has a Supreme Court.

Actually, Texas and Oklahoma have two,

one each for criminal cases and for civil cases,

but those courts are principally tasked

with interpreting state law.

Sometimes you can have federal issues

come up in those cases.

A state criminal prosecution, for example,

can raise Fourth Amendment issues.

But typically the state Supreme Courts get the last word

on the meaning of their state's laws

and the US Supreme Court gets the last word

on the meaning of federal law.

A Reddit user asks, What government entity has oversight

over the US Supreme Court

that's now showing almost open corruption

from payments for housing vacations

and payment of schooling for children?

So this has always been a little tricky.

I mean, the Supreme Court is an independent branch.

It is not supposed to be subject to oversight

in quite the same ways that maybe lower courts might be

or the executive branch agencies.

Historically the way this has worked

is there has been a healthy, but sometimes heated,

back and forth between the political branches

and the Supreme Court.

Congress controls the Supreme Court's budget,

Congress controls the Supreme Court's docket,

and those have been levers

that historically Congress has pulled

as a way of pushing on the justices to behave better.

One of the things that has really happened

in the last 25 or 30 years that has gotten us

to where we are today with the Supreme Court

is Congress has mostly stopped pulling those levers.

And so when we talk about problems

with the current Supreme Court,

when we talk about opportunities

for reform of the current Supreme Court,

I like to start with the accountability question.

How can Congress impose more accountability on the justices

without interfering with judicial independence?

Maybe part of that starts

with an inspector general within the judicial branch,

someone who could supervise

whether the justices are complying with the relevant ethics

and financial disclosure rules.

Maybe it starts with getting back into the norm

of having the justices testify before Congress,

something that used to happen with somewhat more regularity.

Whatever you think the specific answer is though,

I think a big part of how we've gotten to where we are today

with the Supreme Court is we have a court that is not

and does not think it ought to be accountable

to the other branches the way that was true

for most of American history.

Well, I think that's it.

I've tried to answer all your questions.

Hope you've liked the answers.

Thanks for joining us. Until next time.

write his own songs?

I mean for this album releasing this year

called Magic Man 2,

I spent one year writing all of them.

Converting from personal diaries to music.

And the reason for that is because

a lot of the songs in the past,

which some of them I wrote, some of them you know,

it's a lot of people... the team's... the team effort.

But I took a year off because...

Actually never made a song for myself.

I understand all that commercial performance music.

But what do I wanna say as a person?

You know, so that's why this album is personal to me.

Does Jackson Wang reply to DMs? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I do. Sometimes, sometimes.

Does Jackson Wang live in L.A. now?

I live in Shanghai with my parents.

And I also live in Seoul. [label peeling]

Does Jackson Wang have tattoos?

I do. A lot.

I have 13, 14, 15? I'm a big fan of Buzz Lightyear.

So I got them like on my legs.

But then we drank so much.

And the tattoo artist was so drunk.

It looked nothing like Buzz.

It's so bad. Do you wanna see it?

Hey, man, hey... Don't laugh, okay?

And don't get me wrong,

he's a very like famous tattoo artist.

Just... so drunk.

Yeah... Okay, next.

KPOP, CPOP, any rising. It's just a lot.

I don't even know. Whatever, you know?

I'm just Jackson Wang.

What is Jackson Wang's net worth?

Chinese name? It's Wang Jaier.

And in Cantonese, it's Wang Ka-yee.

But Jackson is my real name.

Passport? I don't have that like a.k.a. bullshit.

It's just Jackson Wang.

And my mom named me Jackson

because she was a fan of Michael Jackson.

And she wished, you know,

her kid could dance and sing like him.

What is Jackson Wang's first language?

I don't have one, I don't know.

Maybe Cantonese?

Hey, thank you, thank you.

When did Jackson Wang debut?

Hey, easy. 2014, January 16th.

When did Jackson Wang become a trainee?

That was 2011, July 3rd. I arrived in Korea.

I got casted.

I was at that time, I used to be a professional athlete.

Professional fencer.

And I was prepping London Olympics.

And I got casted in school.

Which honest, honestly-speaking, I was lucky.

'Cause I was just playing basketball after exam.

And you're supposed to go home after exam.

But I stayed.

And whoever that was playing basketball with me...

They weren't as good-looking as me.

So thank god they were there.

You know, you got no choice. But I was the only one.

Literally, only three people on the court.

So I'm thankful to them to this day.

When did Jackson Wang...

[label peeling] go solo?

I don't remember. I think I was 23.

I didn't go out. Like I just did my own thing.

And lucky, lucky enough, the company that I was in was JYP.

And they allowed me to do that.

So I'm still grateful to this day.

When did Jackson Wang

[label peeling] come to India?

Two years ago, I think.

Yeah, two year... Three years ago. Two or three years ago.

Yeah. Mumbai for a music festival.

It was dope.

Okay. Okay, cool.

Jackson Wang's tour?

Maybe after the album, Magic Man 2.

And I think this time I wanna travel to more cities.

Deep in Europe, deep in South America.

I also wanna go to India, Indonesia.

Also Africa if I can.

You know some cities we're really crazy,

where you can feel the crowd

that they're ready to die with you.

You know like, and they're partying.

And they're not even shooting.

They're not even holding on to their phones.

They're not even shooting videos.

They're just there to party and to have a good time.

[label peeling]

Jackson Wang new album?

My new album is Magic Man 2 dropping this year.

And it's a self-serving album.

Is what I wanna say as a person.

[label peeling]

Jackson Wang red bracelet?

Oh, this one?

So in Chinese culture,

if your sign is matching with the current year.

So if this year is that Year of the dog,

and if my sign is dog, too.

There's a saying that you gotta be careful that year.

Either you're gonna be super-successful,

or you're gonna G.G.

Like you're gonna die. Like you're gonna fail.

Like some shit is gonna happen to you.

So in order to prevent that,

your parents need to give you a red bracelet

to protect you.

And we gotta wear red underwear, whatever. Just red.

And it's supposed to fall off naturally.

So this is from the previous Year of the Dog.

It's still there.

I'm just waiting. I'm waiting for it to fall off.

[label peeling]

Jackson Stanford University.

I received scholarship in Stanford right...

While I was prepping for London back then.

So before giving up everything, and went to Korea.

[label peeling]

Jackson Wang yulong perfume?

This is a perfume that I've been using

for more than four years.

Four, five years.

I prefer yulong tea because it feels,

it's like nature, natural smell.

Instead of like fruity, and like cologne.

Like that's too strong for me.

[board clacking]

Last one?

Like let's see this. [label peeling]

Where does Jackson Wang live now?

Shanghai and Seoul, Korea.

[label peeling]

Where does Jackson Wang grew up?

I was born and raised in Hong Kong.

And also Shanghai.

My mom's from Shanghai, my dad's from Gwangju.

For 13 years, it's just back and forth from,

between Hong Kong and Shanghai.

14, 15, I was in Budapest for fencing.

And then Sicily for seven, eight month.

And then went back to Hong Kong for exam.

And that's when I got casted.

Jackson Wang... [label peeling]

Where did Jackson Wang go to school?

In Hong Kong. It's called AIS.

American International School.

[label peeling]

How to style Jackson Wang hair?

I would wear a hat. I like wearing hats.

Beanies... Yeah, I like to wear them.

'Cause I feel like when you do your hair, it's too serious.

Especially for like lifestyle content.

But performance, like performing... Then, sure.

Or red carpet.

This is... [fingers tapping]

This better be a good one, man.

It's the last one.

Don't disappoint me.

[label peeling]

Okay, wait. Wait... Hold on.

[label peeling]

Oh! Okay, safe. Was Jackson Wang at Coachella 2024?

I was, yeah. I was.

Hey, I'm so blessed. I'm so grateful, you know?

Being able to perform for three years.

So grateful for them.

Hopefully not this year.

'Cause I don't have songs to perform. Maybe next year.

If I... If they invite me.

When you go to the airport, you're likely being surveilled

more than anywhere else in your life.

Airports are really where the trade-offs

between security and privacy come into focus.

2015 and 2017, Homeland Security found

that TSA failed to stop mock explosives 95% of the time,

so are these current safety measures truly effective?

This is Incognito Mode.

[tenebrous music]

[machinery clicks]

One thing that we assume is just part of flying

is going through a body scanner,

but body scanners have only been in place since 2010,

that's not really that long ago,

and they're really only there because of one guy.

In 2009, a man accused of being a terrorist

flew into Detroit on Flight 253,

packed with powerful explosives in his underwear.

The man attempted to detonate the bomb

while the plane was descending into Detroit,

but it only caught fire and didn't actually explode.

This man flew from Yemen to Nigeria to the Netherlands

and then to the United States,

and at no point was he detected.

It's for this reason

that we all have to go through body scanners.

So, what do TSA agents see

when you go through a body scanner?

[Narrator] Technology that can see under your clothes.

Until 2013, some body scanners used x-ray,

which made a very clear image of your nude body

every time you went through

and TSA agents were able to see this.

They've since discontinued the use

of the x-ray body scanners

and now use a version that obscures

any sensitive areas on your body.

The types of body scanners now in use

are millimeter wave scanners.

Instead of showing your real body,

privacy software creates a 3D doll-like image

and then flags areas that agents might need to check.

Have you ever gone through one of those

and then an area of your body gets flagged

and checked for, like, no apparent reason?

Sometimes the machines aren't working

or the line for the machines is too long,

so then you know, an agent will just let a bunch of people

arbitrarily go through a metal detector,

which is what they used to use,

and then just as arbitrarily,

they say, Okay, that's all,

and everyone else continue going through the scanner.

So, all of these things just make you wonder,

what are we really catching here

and how airtight is this security?

It's really hard to prove that something is working

because of the absence of something,

and yet it feels intuitive.

Like, we're pretty sure, like,

this has to be doing something, right?

Like, knowing that you're gonna go through

all the surveillance and pat downs or whatever

when you go to the airport

has to be a deterrent to somebody somewhere.

Like, there's probably been some terrorist attacks

that didn't happen just because nobody tried

because these systems are in place, right?

Deterrence is a valuable tool in, like,

a security toolbox,

but it can't justify all intrusions into privacy,

so, like, we can understand that there's some amount of that

that is valuable and productive,

but it doesn't necessarily mean just anything goes.

We still wanna think about the balance of,

well, what is that measure that is having a deterrent effect

and is it worth the trade-off?

[tenebrous music]

You may have seen in the headlines recently

that facial recognition is expanding

to more and more airports.

Facial recognition is one form of surveillance

that relies on biometrics.

Biometrics are your personal identifiers,

think your face, fingerprint,

anything about you that's inherent to who you are,

and that's why people are so concerned

about biometric surveillance.

Those are things you can't change, can't hide,

can't do anything about.

You can imagine how bad it is

if somebody gets your social security number,

but now imagine they have your fingerprint

or your iris scan,

and that's when it gets into new, uncharted territory.

Once an entity has that data, that's you forever, right?

If that organization were to misuse that data,

or if it's stolen or whatever could happen,

once it's kind of out of your control,

there's a potential privacy risk

that just sort of endures through your whole life.

So, why is this a big deal?

Well, it used to be that all these databases were disparate.

They didn't all communicate with each other,

they didn't all share the same data.

That's starting to change.

We're gonna have a big, giant database

of everybody's photos, everybody's identities,

and the fact of the matter is we don't really know

how these systems could be used in the future.

One of the first rules of privacy and security

is to limit the creation of data in the first place,

and so facial recognition is just another way

of creating more data about you

that could eventually be abused.

People have said for a long time,

Well, what's the point of declining?

you know, whether it's a face scan

or other types of data collection.

The government already has all my data anyway, right?

For many years, the sort of response to that

was, well, in the U.S.,

you know, the way the federal government is set up,

each agency's data is siloed from the others.

Even if you had given data to one agency

or particularly, like, a state-level agency,

that doesn't mean all the federal agencies

or the whole federal government has that information.

You know, both sides of the aisle,

like, that has been viewed as a really fundamental right.

At times, there've been initiatives

to try to do, like, a universal ID within the U.S.

where sort of, like, all the checks and everything

would be built into this one card or document or whatever,

but there was always pushback to that,

again, on both sides, but particularly from Republicans

saying, I don't want the government in my business.

I don't want a, like, central point of control

of knowing who everyone is,

and that's why it has largely remained a state's directive,

but now like you're saying,

there's really a movement away from that

in this very sort of casual, like,

well, now this is happening

and all federal data is being centralized kind of way,

completely ignoring the fact

that there's been literally decades of debate about this.

In November 2024, a bipartisan group of 12 senators

that includes Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders

signed a letter asking the TSA for more information

about how they're gonna conduct oversight

of the expanding use of facial recognition

at airports across the United States.

The senators warn that soon,

hundreds of airports will have facial recognition,

but they also say people aren't aware

that they're able to opt out.

You're allowed to tell the TSA,

No, I don't wanna be subjected to facial recognition,

but the senators say they've received reports

of travelers encountering belligerent TSA officers

who don't wanna allow them to opt out,

which is their right to do.

When a bipartisan group of senators

sends the TSA a letter like this,

you can tell there's broad concern

over the oversight of TSA facial recognition systems.

The fact that the senators

even had to send a letter like this

just shows that there's very little information

about how effective these systems are.

Even though things seem to be moving

in this direction right now,

where all this data seems like it's being stockpiled

more and more by the federal government,

it's still worth being thoughtful,

you know, declining anything you want to decline

or you feel that you can

because there can still be value in that

and you kinda never know which way the wind is gonna blow

and what's gonna happen.

The data minimization concept still applies.

[machinery clicks]

If you've been to, like, a major airport recently,

you've probably had somebody come up and be like,

Hey, do you wanna sign up for CLEAR?

Do you wanna skip the line? Yeah, exactly,

and then who doesn't wanna skip the line,

but this isn't a government agency

that's operating the system.

This is a system called CLEAR

and it's run by a third-party company.

An alternative to CLEAR is the TSA PreCheck program,

which is basically the same thing,

but it's run by the U.S. government.

What is the deal with CLEAR

and why is there more issues

with a third-party company kind of doing this

instead of just the U.S. government?

Well, when something is a third party,

like a private company,

consumers may not have control

over what happens to that data,

either right away,

like, you've had your face scanned, you know, by this entity

and then maybe, you know,

a company is selling it to a third party,

or you know, sharing it with a partner, things like that,

but there's also been a lot of situations where over time,

a company that holds data

is then acquired by another company, goes bankrupt,

or merges with another company

and the data starts to change hands and change hands.

So, something like CLEAR,

short-term, it's a way

to get through airport security faster,

but you're entrusting this durable, non-changeable,

you know, biometric information with an entity.

You know, you don't know where that will lead over time.

CLEAR works by scanning various biometrics about you.

That includes your iris, your fingerprint,

and now they're starting to move

into full facial recognition.

In exchange for using CLEAR,

you're able to get through the line more quickly,

and the company claims

that using the facial recognition technology

will speed up things even more.

CLEAR's privacy policy says

that it will share your information with the government

if authorities issue a subpoena.

The may also share your information

in connection to an investigation

into potential illegal activity.

You're also trusting the company to safeguard your data

and you don't really have much insight

into how the company's doing that.

CLEAR's not subjected to public records laws

and that means it's a lot harder to get information

about how the company is storing your data,

treating that data,

and that they're not abusing it.

CLEAR says, what is it, in 10 minutes or something,

you can, you know, just sign up here

and you can walk right through,

so it really raises the point of that security screening,

taking shoes off, taking the laptop out of the bag,

all of those things.

Is that really keeping us safe

if we can so easily skip it?

Yeah, and it's also normalizing the acceptance

of additional surveillance in exchange for convenience.

It's not even exchange for security necessarily,

it's just an exchange for getting through the line faster.

I think that's a great point.

You know, like we were saying,

we as a society kind of created this challenge

of long waits at airport security,

and now look, here's this private company

that will solve it for us.

So, the worst-case scenario I can see here

is kind of already happening.

Like, CLEAR is not just at airports.

It's in stadiums, it's in arenas,

and so we're already starting to see this company's mission

creep out into the rest of the world

and it's becoming tied to the profits of a private company

that we have absolutely no control

over how they're gonna conduct themselves.

It's one thing for it to be the government,

where you have some say in it in a representative democracy

like we live in in the United States,

whereas a private company, you just have no control.

They're gonna do whatever they're gonna do

and mostly they're gonna do

whatever's gonna make them the most money

in exchange for our privacy,

and so it's gonna become increasingly invasive.

[machinery clicks]

Anytime you go to an international airport,

you're technically entering a U.S. border zone.

This means your devices

might be subjected to warrantless searches

by Customs and Border Protection agents.

In January, directly after his inauguration,

President Donald Trump signed an executive order

allowing agents to conduct enhanced vetting

of anyone entering the United States.

Trump's executive order empowers border agents

to use more aggressive tactics

when vetting travelers coming into the United States.

This might mean pulling people aside

into interrogation rooms

or searching their devices.

For example, in early 2025,

a French scientist was allegedly denied entry

because a border agent found text messages on his phone

that were critical of Trump and his science policies.

Now, when you're at an airport,

TSA isn't allowed to search through your phone.

It's only CBP officers that have the authority to do so.

While people have become increasingly concerned

about having their devices searched at the border,

studies show that since 2021,

there's only been a 0.1% increase in device searches.

I would say a large number

of the inspections that we have here

do not include any electronics whatsoever.

Is it within our authority to search those items?

It is, but we use our discretion

when we're looking to use that search parameter.

So historically, there's no huge cause for concern,

but that could change.

And when we're talking about these device searches,

there's kind of two levels of a search.

One is the agent just literally looks through your phone

and you know, some of the advice

is make sure it's on airplane mode

or make sure you just turn it off and stow it away

so they don't think to search it in the first place.

The other is a lot more invasive. Can you talk about that?

CBP agents could run, like,

more detailed digital analysis on it,

potentially even remove some of your data

or you know, copy your data off your phone.

It gives them more ability

to kinda map out, like, your accounts

and start to understand potentially

what other data you have stored elsewhere.

So, that's why that first check,

you know, when we talk about what might be suspicious,

what might raise some red flags

because you're in that first search

that you're talking about,

just sort of a casual flipping through,

you want everything to look cool and just look chill

because then it doesn't need to progress beyond that.

So, if a CBP officer wants to search your device,

can you say no?

Well, it depends on who you are.

If you're a U.S. citizen,

you can absolutely deny a search of your device.

Your device might be confiscated, you might have some delay,

but you'll still get in the country.

If you're a green card holder,

you may face some types of immigration consequences

for denying a search of your device.

For visa holders, they may be refused entry

and have their visas revoked.

[machinery clicks]

From the moment you enter a terminal

till you go to board your flight,

you're likely being subjected to surveillance from hundreds,

if not thousands of cameras.

That's something you've probably already thought about.

It's an airport. Of course you're gonna be monitored.

But the number of cameras seems to be increasing

at international airports.

At LAX for example, they recently upped the number

from around 1,000 to around 3,000 cameras,

and they have plans to expand that surveillance

to the 10-mile perimeter around the airport.

But it's not just the number of cameras.

These devices are also getting enhanced capabilities,

such as AI analytics that monitor crowd behavior,

individual behavior, unauthorized areas, and loitering.

It's very hard for humans

to grasp when we are being surveilled

by video surveillance nonstop,

and I think the incorporation of AI

into all of these systems,

it's even harder to grasp the depth

of the analysis and information that can be, you know,

extracted in near real-time

about just any footage that's coming in.

So, our instinct is to kinda think,

well, okay, even if we can understand

there's all those cameras everywhere, which is hard enough,

then it's like, Yeah,

but nobody can be watching everything all the time,

but AI actually makes it more possible.

Let's say an AI system,

this can happen anywhere, but an AI system in an airport

determined that you were acting suspicious.

Like, Oh, Andrew has a suspicious walk

in the terminal today.

You know, that is a very subjective decision,

so you know, as AI is integrated

into more and more systems,

these are the types of things

that we all need to be aware of, and be conscious of,

and be, you know, making proactive decisions as a society

rather than just allowing things

to kind of drift where they will.

We should address that. We shouldn't just leave that.

[machinery clicks] [tenebrous music]

Airports weren't always like this.

It's only since the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks

that the U.S. really ramped up security at airports.

TSA's 2025 budget is $11.8 billion,

and according to one poll,

three in four Americans say they trust the TSA

to keep them safe.

Is it important to take measures to keep everybody safe?

Of course, absolutely.

Security is paramount, especially at airports,

but do we really need to be throwing out our water bottles

every time we go through airport security?

Maybe not.

There may be other ways to do this that are better,

both for our security and for our privacy.

A big criticism of TSA and airport security checkpoints

is that they aren't really effective a lot of the time

and that the core thing that's happening

is what's called security theater:

this ruse to make everyone feel better

that isn't necessarily doing anything.

Yeah, whether the TSA is popular or not, I don't know,

but people definitely want good security at airports.

If it's achieving that goal, that's great.

I think it's hard to know

whether it's actually achieving that goal,

and so I think that's problematic on two fronts.

One, because that raises the possibility

of something bad happening

and it making all of the surveillance

and intrusions that we're subjected to at the airport

kind of for naught,

and the other is that we're giving up a ton of privacy

to have something that's not really working

the way that it should,

and so I think there needs to be a lot more clarity

in terms of how effective each and every system and process

that the TSA subjects the public to is

and whether or not it's actually increasing our safety

or whether it's just making us feel better.

Yeah, and I think that's a really good point

that it isn't all or nothing.

Each component can and should be evaluated

to see how effective it is.

Some could be taken away, some could be added.

It doesn't have to be in one direction or the other,

but if we're going to kind of create a problem

and a whole industry around airport security,

it needs to actually be accomplishing the goal.

You know, it's important to say that, like,

a lot of this in the U.S.

came from the September 11th attacks,

and so there was, like, a real tragedy

and a real reason behind all of this concern

and trying to step up security,

but just because there's a good reason to consider

or reconsider the security of something

and how you implement that,

you know, it doesn't necessarily mean

that where things have landed is the best way.

Yeah, exactly, and I mean, I am very sympathetic

to people being okay with surveillance

to avoid terrorist attacks.

I mean, we both lived in New York City on September 11th.

We are filming this right now in the World Trade Center.

The footprints of the old World Trade Center

are literally right behind us,

and so, you know, we're well aware

of the consequences of security failures,

but that doesn't mean that we need to live in a world

where intense surveillance any time you travel

is just how it has to be.

[machinery clicks]

So, what can you do if you're traveling through an airport

and you wanna protect your privacy?

Unfortunately, there's not much,

but there are a few steps you can take.

One, know your rights.

This is gonna change depending on who you are,

what your immigration status is,

and exactly where you're traveling,

but just make sure you're up to speed

on what agents can and cannot do.

Two, use a dedicated travel phone.

This is a device that is only gonna have things on it

that you're comfortable an agent searching through.

And third, don't sign up for CLEAR or other systems like it,

and opt out of facial recognition.

No matter how belligerent the agent gets,

you can always say no.

This was Incognito Mode. Until next time.

True or false?

You, Bryan Johnson, the man sitting across from me,

one day, at some point,

as of yet undefined in the future, you will die.

False.

Tell me more.

[camera shutter clicks]

[upbeat music]

Death has always been inevitable.

And so we have made all these preparations,

like, we talk about immortality

in professional achievement,

we talk about a life after death.

And so they are the ways

that we've dealt with it up to this point.

And now we have this real possibility

of extending our lifespans to some unknown horizon.

So that's extension.

But we also have the ability to begin moving ourself

to computational systems.

So currently, in a very crude form,

I have a Bryan AI

that has digested everything I've ever said all by-

You do currently have this?

[Bryan] I do. Okay.

Yeah, and so as the technology gets better,

and it gets trained on more of my thoughts,

it's only going to improve.

I think all of us are in a time and place

where we will be immortal to some degree.

Now, whether it's in this body,

whether it's in some kind of computational arrangement,

whether it's both, or a combination of both,

I think we've reached that point as a civilization.

And the reason I ask that, I mean maybe it's obvious,

but I'm trying to sort of understand

from what premise you are beginning, right?

Because you talk a lot about living a healthier life,

extending the human lifespan.

What I was curious about is sort of how far you see

that possibly going,

and sort of whether you accept the notion for yourself

that, at some point, you, Bryan,

your biological material, right,

everything that makes you you will be buried,

will be cremated, there will be a will,

there will be an estate plan, right?

That all of those things

that go into the way we plan for death,

like, are those things that you contemplate

and that you plan for or not?

Do you have a will?

I do.

Yeah. Good.

I do.

I have a will,

and I've made all the practical decisions on,

if I am in a comatose state, what are my instructions?

So I have gone through all those preparations.

The future is always present.

It's just a question if you can see it or not.

And I think this moment is probably the biggest test

of trying to piece together what is really happening

with the speed at which AI is improving

and what does that mean

for how it's going to change everything we understand

about reality.

And many people are poking at this,

like, trying to make their predictions

and organize the world to the best they can.

And I'm basically saying

that we are headed towards this event horizon

where AI is now improving at a certain speed.

In a few years time, we probably can't see past that point.

We don't know what happens.

And as technology gets better and better,

the most prized asset is going to be existence.

That immortality, as we thought about it before,

through accomplishment or through offspring

or any other, or the afterlife,

will be devalued relative to existing.

And that's my fundamental bet on the future,

is that's where we're headed.

[camera shutter clicks]

Let me ask you this,

if there was a world where, let's say, in five years,

you could upload Bryan...

Yeah.

Into an AI, right,

an AI Bryan is, yeah, pretty much as good as Bryan Bryan.

Does Bryan Bryan eat the cheeseburger?

Yeah. You know what I mean?

Like, does some of this, does sort of this, you know,

from everything I can tell,

it is every waking minute of your life,

and it is every sleeping minute of your life

sort of committed to this one singular goal, right?

That is your entire existence.

Yeah.

Have you contemplated whether or not that would change?

Yeah.

I mean, okay, so let's think about your question

in a different way.

I could say about people today

that most people spend every waking moment pursuing wealth.

The time they're not spending pursuing wealth,

they're pursuing some sort of status or prestige,

you know, socially signaling to their community,

their tribe of some power,

or something to that effect.

Now, I could certainly say that

and say that's a malaise that has everybody locked in

to a singular game that is consuming

all of their resources and all their attention.

And what I'm saying is I'm devoting every second

of my existence to existence.

When you die, inevitably, that's when how it has been,

it makes sense to pursue power and status.

That makes sense.

When you give birth to superintelligence

and now you can start extending lifespans

to some unknown horizon, 200 years, a thousand years,

10,000 years, we don't know, millions of years,

we don't know.

When that happens, the entire game of humanity shifts

from that singular focus

on wealth accumulation and status and prestige to existence.

Now embedded in existence,

we may still play games

of power, prestige, status, et cetera,

but it'll be conditioned of that existence itself

is the highest virtue.

That's the shift that's starting to happen right now.

So let me pivot over then to the conversation

about your existence.

So, you know, you've talked at length,

you talked a great deal.

You are very much out there in the public eye

talking about a day in the life of Bryan.

Yeah.

Walk us through a day in the life right now.

I know that the protocol changes,

that you're adapting it, modifying it.

What does it look like today?

Take us through a typical day

for you. Yeah.

It may be helpful to have the backdrop

that what I do is I'm saying

that existence is the highest virtue.

And if you accept that premise, then I say on a given day,

I want to identify every single thing

that could kill me or make me die.

And then I want to identify every single thing

that could help me make me live.

Okay.

And so let's just say I live in California

and the life expectancy is around 79 years.

So if I behave like a typical human,

I probably have a life expectancy to 79 years of age.

Now, if I identify things

that could potentially shorten that,

like smoking, drinking, breathing bad air,

drinking toxic water, you know, not getting exercise,

et cetera, then if I think of good things

that could extend my life even further

to, you know, currently the cap is, like, 120,

I can say, well, I'm gonna eat healthy foods and exercise.

And so my daily protocol

is basically trying to identify at a molecular level

every single thing that either extends or shortens life, so.

I mean, I'm laughing because your daily protocol,

I will be honest, it's much more elaborate

than eating well and exercising.

It was not just eating well and exercising,

like, you'd have a pretty chill time.

Yeah.

You're not necessarily having, like, the chillest time.

[Bryan] Yeah.

Tell us a little bit

about that. Okay, cool.

So, my everyday begins the night before.

[Katie] Okay.

So I have built my entire existence around sleep.

I mean, I like that. You have to sleep.

Yeah. How well do you sleep?

Well, we're gonna get to that.

Can you tell me how many hours a night you sleep?

Eight hours and 34 minutes is my 12-month average.

My sleep profile is that of a early 20 something.

I've worked very hard at this.

So it's eight hours and 34 minutes.

I get over four hours of restorative sleep.

That's deep sleep and REM, where the body cleans itself

and repairs and rebuilds.

I'm up less than one time per night on average.

I go to bed, within two to three minutes,

I have my head hitting the pillow,

and I have 94% sleep efficiency.

So once I lay down

and my stress score during the night,

like, typically, most people's sleep signal

is like a rocky chart of a stock market, you know,

and mine is just flat, like my consciousness is at peace.

And so those are the stats you wanna see

for a perfect night's sleep.

But to do that, you can't just show up

and just say, I'm gonna put my head on the pillow

and fall asleep.

You kind of have to build

your whole life system around that.

So my day begins the night before when I go to sleep,

and then I'll wake up around 4:30 or 5:00.

Okay.

And then I'll do, for the next four hours,

I will have a series of measurements and therapies.

I get outta bed, I try to, within one minute of waking.

Within one minute?

Yeah, I try to avoid the 10 more minutes

or pull the phone up and start scrolling.

I get up, I will get light in my eyes

within a few minutes of waking.

So I wake up before the sun,

so it's 10,000 lux light in my eye for a few minutes.

I'll take my inner ear temperature.

I measure my temperature every single day.

One thing we've noticed is,

as I've done this for the past four years,

my body temperature has dropped

almost four degrees Fahrenheit, a massive drop.

So now it's around 94 degrees Fahrenheit each morning.

That's down from 98.7.

So there's good evidence that species

with a lower basal temperature live longer.

I will then put a serum on my hair or my scalp,

rub my scalp with a silicone scrubber for hair growth.

I'll take a quick shower and then I'll come downstairs.

I have a morning drink.

I will eat something, I'll work out for an hour.

I'll do red light therapy.

I'll then do a hyperbaric oxygen therapy, then some sauna,

then I'll rinse off and then I'm ready for work.

Okay. So that is quite a regimen.

And you stop eating at?

Around noon.

Around noon.

Yeah, and then, like, also in the morning,

I'll typically do, like, a few tests.

Like today, I did three tests.

There's so much to this protocol,

there's sort of so much data that you've accumulated.

Really quickly, like, rapid fire,

not to put you on the spot, but I am,

ask me a couple really quick questions about myself.

[Bryan] Yeah. And then tell me

how am I doing in the Bryan Johnson universe.

[Bryan] Great. Go.

What is your resting heart rate?

48 beats per minute.

[Bryan] That's fantastic. Thank you.

What is your most recent inflammation,

your body inflammation blood test result, your hs-CRP?

Bryan, I have no idea.

What is your blood glucose level?

A good one.

Okay. Okay, good.

How many continuous pushups can you do?

Probably, like, 10. Okay.

If you stood on one foot and closed your eye,

how long could you stay standing?

A minute.

Yeah. A minute?

[Katie] Yes. A minute.

That's very good.

Oh, yeah.

[Bryan] Okay. Good. Try me.

[Bryan] Okay. Not right now.

[Bryan laughs]

Yeah. What is the length of your telomeres?

I don't know.

Okay. What are your omega levels?

[Bryan] I don't know. Okay.

These are very involved questions.

What is your speed of aging?

Well, according to the skin test I took earlier, Bryan,

it was 1.9.

Yeah. Yeah.

So tell me, okay, so I didn't learn very much.

I think what I learned is that there's a lot more to this

than do you drink, do you smoke, do you exercise,

do you sleep enough?

That's what I thought you were gonna ask me.

I do not know the length of my telomeres.

[Bryan] Yeah. But apparently,

that's something someone can find out.

Yeah, so the reason I ask you those questions

is because I can pose a question, like, How's your sleep?

[Katie] Yeah.

And you can give me a generic answer like,

I sleep great or I feel great.

But if you look at the actual data of your telomere length,

it tells me the story of your overall health.

The same with your blood glucose levels.

The same with your speed of aging.

These are readouts of your biology that just say,

This is me in raw form.

There's no storytelling, there's no subjective assessment.

It's just the data.

[camera shutter clicks]

You were in a Netflix documentary earlier this year.

You talked a lot sort of about your history

in that documentary, right?

You were a successful entrepreneur.

You felt like you weren't living your healthiest life.

You parted ways with Mormonism.

You were Mormon for a very, very long time.

You got divorced, right?

You went through all of these seismic life changes.

And a lot of people make major changes

to their lives, right?

They hit a wall with stress or in a marriage

or with their religion, right?

Exceedingly few people.

Very, very, very, very, very few people

go as far as you have.

What is it that pushed you past the point

that the vast majority of people would go?

I'm really motivated by having read

various biographies of history

and people throughout time and place,

in their moment, they were able to identify

the most far ranging ambition identifiable.

You couldn't have sequenced the genome in the year 1800.

The technology wasn't present.

You could have had that ambition in the early 90s.

And that they did, someone did.

And they actually sequenced the genome.

And so in any given time point,

a new emergent possibility is present.

Then there's two questions that arise.

One is, what is it?

And two is, will somebody do it?

And in the year 2021 was the first time in human history

where a person could say,

We are the first generation who won't die

and not be ridiculed.

It just became possible.

And I saw that and I thought this is a moment,

like, when it comes together where you see it

and you can do something about it.

And so I wanted to try to capture what this moment is.

Hmm.

Now, if you talk to people who know me,

if you asked my husband, right, poor guy,

they would say that I'm a very controlled person, right?

Like, I wake up at the same time every day.

I do the same exercise.

I tend to eat a lot of very similar foods.

Like, there's a lot of routine and structure to my life.

I will say, when I read about you,

when I watch, you know, videos about you,

when I hear about the way you live,

I, as a very controlled person,

am astounded at how controlled your life is.

Have you always been that way?

Well, like, when you think back 20 years ago, 30 years ago,

six years ago, was control always something

that was a defining characteristic?

Mm-hmm.

I suppose it's the difference

between being called a germophobe and being germ-aware

and how people label your methodical building

of life systems as control.

And I would reframe it and say,

you're actually a really smart engineer.

That you realize that the metabolic cost

of you having to make these decisions every single day

spur of the moment is so expensive to you

that you are wise and say, You know what?

It's not worth it.

I'm just going to systematize this

so that my brain can then be allocated

towards other higher level thinking.

So I would applaud your systems

and say like, you actually are very clever

in the way you've structured your life.

And so I kind of feel the same way

that why would I fight these daily miscellaneous,

ultimately irrelevant decisions

on a moment-to-moment basis when they can just be automated?

And I'd rather spend my scarce brain capacity

thinking of higher level things

about the future of the human race, for example,

than I would, like, what am I gonna have for breakfast?

And so I think historically,

I've very much thought like an engineer my entire life.

You take a given system, you dissect its parts,

you reassemble it into some kind of constructive

and positive manner.

But I'd say, like, what I do now

is definitely beyond what I did before.

But what I'm trying to demonstrate is Bryan Johnson in 2025

is a normal dude in 2030.

It's just like our-

In five years?

In five years, that the apparatus around us

that things will just be automated,

health will be so much more automated than we are now.

That the weirdness of who I am

or what I am will be forgotten.

People will remember in that context,

but when they look at me, they'll just be like,

Oh, yeah, like, he just was ahead of the time.

[camera shutter clicks]

I was getting ready for this interview.

I was reading, sort of reading up on you.

And in 2023, I was leading the newsroom at VICE.

And we actually published a story on you.

And you talked in that story about your body image

from decades ago.

You talked about how hard it was at that time

to control yourself around food at night, right?

You talked about how you now often go to bed hungry,

that you have learned to find joy in that.

And in reading that and just in very good faith,

I'm being very transparent with you here,

if I stripped your name out of that,

and I just looked at a bulleted list of those comments,

you know, that sounds a lot like me 20 years ago

with a very serious eating disorder.

I mean, there was a period in my life where I was very sick,

and I was very controlled

and everything that went into my mouth, right?

And it wasn't about the number on the scale,

it wasn't about how I looked.

It was about being able to systematize

and control my environment.

And, you know, I am not a doctor, I'm not a psychiatrist.

I think if you were to ask some doctors and psychiatrists,

and I'm sure this criticism has been leveled before,

these comments have been made before,

they would say, Well, that sounds like disordered behavior.

That sounds like an eating disorder.

Yeah.

Does that resonate with you?

I mean, how do you respond to that?

And I think particularly,

when we're talking not just about you,

but about you as a public figure

advocating for a certain approach to health,

do you have concerns about sort of

what you are advocating for and sort of what you are doing

and how that might be adopted

by sort of the population at large?

Yeah. Yeah.

Most people I know in America have an eating disorder.

I rarely meet somebody

who doesn't find themselves late in the evening powerless

to stop themselves from eating the ice cream or the cookies

or the chips or, you know,

whatever else they find in the pantry.

That is probably the most universal experience

shared among Americans in this moment.

And it probably has to do with a combination of,

it's culturally acceptable.

Our foods were scientifically,

methodically built to be addictive.

You just pull up an app

and, like, delivers to your house real time

whatever you want.

So I would say it's really more

of a widespread societal problem

that we have an addiction problem with food, our phones,

and, you know, our entertainment, our scrolling,

it's everywhere.

And so certainly,

I don't know if my addiction is more excessive

than other people's addictions,

or if it just weighted more towards food versus the phone.

But I'd say I'm probably pretty average

on a population level addiction scale.

Hmm, and so you have sort of taken that,

I guess, what used to manifest in one way,

which is sort of, like, an inability

to control what you were eating when you were eating it.

And you have adopted a new way of approaching it,

which is saying, I eat these things at these times,

and I sort of eliminate the variables,

I take the choice out of it,

and that is how I am going to manage

this part of my health.

Yeah, exactly.

And I guess more broadly,

it's kind of a cultural commentary

where I'm saying the most powerful forces in all of society,

corporations, are pointing their power

at getting you to be addicted to their thing.

Whether it's scrolling their app,

whether it's eating their food,

whether it's watching their show,

all their science, all their technology,

all their intelligence is pointed at you

and trying to get you to be addicted.

And what I was saying is, when you are addicted to anything,

it reduces your freedom and your agency,

they ultimately have you in a bind.

I don't want to be addicted to anything.

I wanna have agency and freedom over my existence

as much as possible.

And so that's what I'm trying to build.

And so I realize that people on the outside looking in,

they do take that approach

and say, He's working through his childhood trauma,

he's working through a food addiction.

I'm open to all those explanations.

Like, I would be the first person to be self-deprecating

and be like, This guy's got issues, unquestionably.

Also, in my interactions with others,

it is a very common phenomena

that humans struggle in modern society.

And I'm trying to offer an antidote

that I didn't have anybody,

not a single person in my life advocating for me

that I take care of my health.

Nobody.

It was work harder.

Like, I'm so proud of you for achieving this.

Like, didn't matter if I was ragged or depressed

or overweight, like, the direction went elsewhere

except for, Bryan, can I be a positive influence

in your life and encourage you to go to bed on time

and get some exercise?

So I'm really trying to play that role in society

where I'm saying, Look, this is a mess.

We are all a mess.

And can we be honest about the situation?

Even those who are accusing me of being addicted

and having a food eating disorder

or whatever the problem,

they themselves are equally shackled with addictions.

You're addicted to longevity.

Yeah.

There's probably no way of actually getting over addiction

other than controlling where your addiction is pointed.

I would agree with that.

[camera shutter clicks]

I wanna ask you about your fame.

You were sort of just talking about population-wide health,

and I think that one of the observations

that I have made as a journalist in the last several months,

since President Trump was elected

and inaugurated in late January,

is that to me with notoriety, with fame

comes a degree of responsibility, right?

Responsibility for what you say, how you say it,

when you speak up, when you choose not to.

I want to ask you about MAHA.

I wanna ask you about RFK Jr.

When President Trump won the election,

you congratulated him on social media

as did so many very high-profile business leaders.

You were photographed with RFK Jr.,

MAHA as sort of the tagline in the photo.

I'm really curious for your assessment

at this point in time of RFK Jr.

and the Trump administration vis-a-vis American health.

If I had to guess,

and I'll let you answer the question in a minute,

you know, I would suspect that there's a lot there

that someone in your position would like, right?

The idea of, you know, stripping additives outta food.

You know, we have also seen massive cuts

at federal health agencies.

We have seen already, you know, grants

with regards to cutting-edge research,

mRNA vaccines being a very early target.

We've seen a lot of sort of the very promising

sort of bleeding-edge medical research

that you have been able to adopt in your own life.

You know, really on the chopping block

in this administration,

I would really appreciate your assessment

of the Trump administration and RFK Jr.

as it pertains to public health,

which is, you know, in many ways,

the sort of premise of your entire operation here, right?

Which is really sort of educating the public

about how to live a healthier life.

Yeah.

How do you rate the administration so far?

Yeah.

I mean RFK is certainly not a status quo person.

I think you can say that,

yeah. Yeah.

And I think I would say

that the status quo in the U.S. is not working.

If you look at the data around the health of our citizenry,

it's embarrassingly bad.

We spend 1.8 times our peer countries in healthcare,

$13,000 per person versus, like, 6,000 or so

the other developed countries.

So we spend more and we get less.

And so whether RFK is the solution or not,

what we're doing is not working.

I'm open to change,

and I'm open to a variety of possibilities.

It's not to say that everything he's doing is correct,

but I do support the idea

that we definitely need to change,

because what we're doing now is not working.

Do you worry about medical research

being delayed, right, by years or decades,

if it is curtailed right now?

Yeah.

In these kinds of circumstances,

I'm not apprehensive of change.

Science always finds a way forward,

and progress always finds a way forward.

And so oftentimes, when one path is discontinued,

everybody thinks it's an end of something,

but actually that change produces a new path

that people didn't anticipate.

So, no, I support the creative destruction.

I think it could have some positive outcomes.

Clearly, there could be some drawbacks,

like, when you break things like this, it goes both ways.

It's not, like, a clean win or loss.

But I'm generally in favor of new ideas or new approach.

Because I mean, I think, what would be cool

is if we as a country said

we want to be number one in the entire world

for life expectancy, that is a very clear goal.

And then once you back into it

and you look at all the practical things

that determine that,

but that to me would be like a something

we all can say we agree,

like living long, healthy lives

and not, you know, long health spans

would be an admirable goal for entire country.

So I would like more unification on this

that we actually have a big goal to work towards,

versus now it's, like, trying to find the evil doers

and knocking them out, which is fine,

but also we don't really have a positive goal.

Who are the evil doers that we're knocking out?

I mean, for example, like, you see the red dye.

A lot of the ingredients we have in this country

are not used because they promote health.

They're used because they create addiction,

or they're low cost.

And so I think there's an acceptance of selling death.

And we just say, That's capitalism.

What else are we gonna do?

What is a life well lived for Bryan Johnson?

Not dying.

People evaluate my life

and they say, Bro is so busy trying to not die,

he ain't living.

They do say that.

And then next they say,

I wish he would get hit by a bus.

Like, they're so upset.

[Katie] Have not seen them say that, but I believe it.

It's, like, LOL, can't wait till he gets hit by a bus.

But they're so upset for a variety of reasons,

whether they can't make the change themself,

whether they feel like they've been wronged,

whether they don't have the willpower.

And I get it, I've been there,

so I'm not blaming them,

but they go through this response

where they're having to reconcile

that they are not the person they wanna be

and someone else is doing something that they're not.

And so they're going through some kind

of reconciliation process.

They go through the other five stages of grief.

And so I understand why people

have a such a strong reaction to me.

I get it.

Like, I've been there before,

and it's a very helpless feeling.

Bryan, thank you for your time.

I'm really glad you came.

Yeah, it's nice to be hanging out with you.

What is Area 51 actually used for?

Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

No, [laughs] just kidding.

I'm Astrobiologist David Grinspoon from NASA.

Let's answer your questions from the internet.

This is Alien Support.

[energetic music]

Disgruntled Hermit asks,

What's the most interesting exoplanet you've read about?

If I had to pick a favorite that we found so far,

it would be the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system.

There are seven planets in the system that we've identified

so far, and probably about three

of them are potentially habitable.

And by the way, the TRAPPIST system is

only 40 light-years away.

Which, if you consider that our galaxy is

a 100,000 light-years across, that's relatively close.

I have a sort of chart here,

and you can see the habitable zone of the TRAPPIST system

with several potential planets in it, compared

to the habitable zone of our solar system on the bottom,

which has Earth, and then you know, sort of possibly Venus

and Mars on the edges of habitability.

And by the way, the TRAPPIST system here,

it's a cooler star than our sun.

It's a red dwarf, and so the planets are

clustered very close.

But imagine what it would be like

for life evolving on a system

with multiple habitable planets

nearby one another.

Meteorites occasionally get blasted off

of one planet and land on another.

We have pieces of Mars here on Earth.

So, if you have a habitable planet with life

and another planet that could be habitable,

you could imagine life spreading easily.

Jabalandkie asks, Are aliens real?

Well, my thought is that aliens are real.

There are probably something

like 30 billion habitable planets in our own galaxy.

And so, even if a small fraction of those have an origin

of life, there's lots of life in our galaxy.

And the more we study Earth

and its origins, we haven't found anything that's sort

of magical or so special about Earth

that those things shouldn't be happening elsewhere.

So if you're asking me, do I think aliens are real, yes.

If you're asking me, do I know scientifically,

I'll say not yet, but we're on the road to find out.

Here's a question from Quora.

How accurate is 'Arrival' scientifically?

I really like the movie Arrival.

I'm watching this scene here

with this astrobiologist, glossed in wonder and awe,

and a little bit of terror, encountering this alien.

We talk about convergent evolution.

That evolution on other worlds would find some

of the same solutions.

So the idea that they have something that's like fingers

for grasping, that makes sense.

The idea that they would have this kind

of symmetry just like we have bilateral symmetry,

they look vaguely squid-like, vaguely octopi,

like I wouldn't be surprised if we saw complex aliens

if they looked somewhat familiar,

but not exactly like any organism we had seen before.

Because again, they'll be responding

to the same overall kinds of evolutionary forces.

And then you have the other factor where she's trying

to communicate, and this alien is doing this weird kind

of circular writing,

and it turns out that they are trying to communicate with us

and they're as equally puzzled by us.

That makes sense because I think there's this whole idea,

something called incommensurability,

that it might really be hard to communicate

'cause they might have very different kinds of cognition,

very different notions of reality and time.

So I find this alien very convincing.

Utopia Circle asks, How exoplanets are discovered?

You can't directly observe the planet

because they're too dim and too far away,

but you can notice what the planet is doing to the star.

So, as a planet orbits a star,

because of the gravitational pull of that planet,

the star actually wobbles a little bit.

So that star is wobbling

'cause there's a planet around it,

even though you can't see the planet.

So, some of the time, the star is coming

towards your telescope, and some

of the time, the star is coming away from your telescope.

We call that a Doppler shift.

When it's coming towards you, the frequency shifts

to a higher frequency, blue.

When it's coming away from you, it shifts

to a lower frequency red.

And so, our instruments got good enough to detect

that slight change, that rhythmic change from blue

to red to blue to red.

It's a very, very tiny shift in wavelengths.

And that was the first sign.

And then, later on, there was a new technique

that's called the transit method.

When a planet passes directly in between you

and the star, you can notice that little bit

of dimming of starlight.

It's very tiny 'cause planets are small

compared to the star.

But if you have a very sensitive measurement of the light

of that star over time, when a planet passes just in front

of it, the star will dim a little bit.

And so, if you watch the light curve over time of that star,

it'll wobble up and down and up and down and up and down.

So you're not so much seeing the planet as noticing

that the planet is blocking the star a little bit,

causing it to periodically dim.

It only works when the geometry's right,

if it's a little bit above or a little bit below,

the direct line between your telescope

and that star, you'll miss it.

So only about 5%

of stars have planets oriented in the right plane,

the right direction to use that transit method.

But when things are lined up right, it's very sensitive.

So that has allowed us now,

especially with space telescopes,

like there was an instrument called Kepler that was designed

to use the transit method to find lots of exoplanets.

And that was really what revealed to us

that most stars in the Universe have planets.

Sowhatvirgo asks, Where do astrobiologists work?

How hard is it to get a job in astrobiology?

So astrobiologists work a lot at universities.

Some of them work in government labs.

Some of us build spacecraft

and send them out to observe other planets.

Some of us do field work

and study exotic locations, go on expeditions

where there's extreme life to understand the limits of life,

and look for some of the earliest signs of life.

This is a rock called a stromatolite.

This one comes from Western Australia

and is about 2.7 billion years old.

And if you look in close, you see this rock is made up

of layers, and what we've learned is

that those layers are from ancient microbial mats.

Some of the earliest life on Earth

that formed these layers on,

what was then the C4 microbes, single-celled organisms,

using the energy of sunlight, using different kinds

of nutrients flowing in the seawater,

and organizing themselves into these layers.

Im at your moms house, asks, What is taking NASA so long

to find them aliens?

What active missions are they doing?

Well, it's a big Universe out there,

but we're working on it.

Obviously, we have rovers on Mars searching

for the signs of ancient life.

So, we have a mission now on its way to Europa, a Moon

of Jupiter that is home to a vast ocean of liquid water.

So, we have a mission called Europa Clipper orbiting

the Jupiter system and making close passes

by Europa in the early 2030s, helping us to understand

if that ocean is habitable, what's the temperature,

the pressure, what are the flows of nutrients, and so forth.

Is that ocean a place that could support life?

And if it is, that would motivate us

to send missions in the future

that would land on the surface,

and maybe even tunnel under the ice in submarines

to look directly for life on Europa.

We also have a mission called Dragonfly

that's going to launch in a few years and go to Titan.

Titan is a moon of Saturn.

It has a thick nitrogen atmosphere like Earth's,

and it's goaded with organic molecules, the same kinds

of molecules that led to the origin of life on Earth.

Dragonfly is going to be basically a nuclear-powered drone

that lands on Titan,

and samples the surface, examines those organic molecules

to see if they're the kinds of molecules that may have led

to life on Earth, and then it's going to take off

and fly to different locations and repeat its experiments.

So, it's gonna be the first time we've actually been able

to explore a planet with an aerial craft

that lands multiple places

and does these kinds of experiments.

We had a mission recently that went

to an asteroid called Bennu.

It collected over 100 grams

of material from the surface of Bennu,

and brought it back to Earth.

So we have, in our labs now, pieces of asteroid dirt,

and what we found is that Bennu is full of the stuff

of life, amino acids.

Amino acids are the things, the building blocks

that make up proteins.

And nucleotides, which are the components

that make up DNA and RNA.

So that's really exciting.

It suggests that not just Earth,

but all the planets, were being sprinkled with the stuff

that basically leads to an origin of life.

So, again, we haven't found life elsewhere,

but we've been finding results that suggest

that life should be common.

X/x/.txt asks, Who came up

with the flying saucer design, and why did it stick?

It turns out that flying saucers go back

to a pilot named Ken Arnold,

who was flying in the Pacific Northwest in 1947,

and he reported something weird that he saw.

What's interesting is

that he never even said it was saucer-shaped.

He didn't understand,

and he described its motion as skipping like a saucer.

I think it's like when you skip rocks or something,

and it kind of bounces like that.

That's what he apparently meant.

And then it got reported in a newspaper

as Pilot sees mysterious flying saucer.

And thus, a huge trope was born.

PUGBUG2 from Reddit asks,

How did the first life form on Earth emerge?

We know something about the most primitive life forms

on Earth because we study modern organisms

and how they're all related.

There's something called LUCA,

the Last Universal Common Ancestor.

Even though we don't have an example of it,

by seeing how different life forms have evolved from it,

we can reconstruct the properties

of that Last Universal Common Ancestor.

And so, we know that it liked hot conditions.

We know that it was a single-celled organism.

We have inferred that it occurred in a watery location.

Some people think sea floor vents.

Some people think tidal areas, little ponds

that were being wet and dried or freeze,

and thawed would've led to the right kinds of chemistry.

We also have experiments that show that the building blocks

of life are very easy to create.

If you mix gases that were in the primitive atmosphere,

then you spark them with energy sources

that were likely present,

lightning, ultraviolet light from the sun.

You easily create these molecules like amino acids

and other chemicals that clearly were important

for the origin of life.

You had gradual increases in chemical complexity.

You probably had the formation

of very simple membranes which separate inside from outside,

and allow the creation of cells.

There are certain chemicals which you put 'em in water

and they create membranes.

We call 'em vesicles.

We know the necessary chemistry, we know what some

of the earliest life was like.

We sort of were closing in on it from multiple directions.

Next question. WinddancerLor.

WTF happened to Ceres?

Ceres is a dwarf planet.

It's basically one

of the largest objects in the asteroid belt,

but we call it a dwarf planet

because it's large enough to be rounded by gravity.

And recently, we sent a spacecraft there,

and we found some surprising things.

Most surprising, you see this large crater

in the center of this image.

It's bright and white,

and what we found is that's a salt deposit.

And that salt deposit indicates that there was water.

And it suggests that this was a water world at one point,

and may still even have liquid water on the inside.

This is very exciting to astrobiologists

because it means that dwarf planets like Ceres are places

where you could have, in the past,

had habitable conditions on the inside.

And who knows, maybe at present, some

of these dwarf planets still have habitable oceans.

So the more we explore the solar system,

the more we're surprised by the level of activity on some

of these worlds that we thought were dead.

New Language4727 asks,

Are there good scientific explanations

for UFO sightings,

such as the USS Nimitz encounters in 2004?

There are some intriguing reports,

and the USS Nimitz one is rather strange.

You know, the ocean boiling some object

that didn't look like a human-made object,

seeming to fly at great speeds, and so forth.

I don't know how to explain it, but the bottom line is,

and we see no reason to think this has anything to do

with astrobiology, or any kind

of extraterrestrial technology.

One of the videos that was recently popularized was taken

by pilots.

If you look at that video,

it does look like something's moving,

sort of, unnaturally fast.

But it turns out if you analyze information we do have,

a lot of that can be explained by parallax.

That is the motion

of the camera can make something look like it's moving

much faster than it is.

So, people that have actually looked at the data said,

You know what, the speed isn't as great,

and the motion isn't as unnatural as we thought.

But you know, I'm the first to admit

that there are things in our atmosphere

that we don't understand.

But as of now, I've not seen anything that tells me, aha,

this is an extraterrestrial mystery.

It's more like, this is a plausible terrestrial mystery,

but we don't know very much about it,

and we don't have very good documentation.

Ashkir asks, What is

the closest another habitable planet could be near Earth?

It's probably, roughly, four light-years,

that is Proxima Centauri,

which is in the nearest star system to Earth,

which, again, for perspective,

the galaxy is about 100,000 light-years.

So, four light-years on the scale

of the galaxy is very close.

Of all the spacecraft we've launched, there are five of them

that are on trajectories

where they will actually escape our solar system.

And most famously, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are

on their way out,

and they will maybe encounter another star system

in something like 100,000 years.

But, of course, it would be millions of years

before one of them actually sort

of wandered into the vicinity of a nearby star.

Fellaonamission asks, Why is water essential

for life on other planets?

Everywhere on Earth where there's life, there's water.

And almost everywhere on Earth where there's water,

there's life.

Water is sort of the universal solvent

that allows life to happen.

Basically, we are organic molecules dissolved in water,

dancing together and doing complex things,

and reproducing themselves.

As far as we can tell, that's what life is.

You clearly need a liquid medium

because the molecules have

to come together in this complex 3D dance

that if they're just frozen in a solid

or loose in a gas, they won't do it.

So, as far as we can tell, you need a liquid for life.

Water is a common liquid in the Universe

and has those properties of interacting with organics

that we have not been able to mimic

with any other chemical in a lab.

So we don't know for sure

that the Universe couldn't have done it in some other way.

Maybe we'll be surprised and find life in ammonia

or methane, or some other liquid.

But as far as we can tell, water is the key

to life in the Universe.

So, Gabe3115 asks,

What do we think about assembly theory?

So, assembly theory attempts to describe the nature of life.

What is the difference between living matter

and non-living matter?

How could we recognize that?

Well, most of the Universe is made

of very simple molecules like this carbon dioxide.

That's not a very complex molecule.

But if you look at the molecules of life like amino acids,

you can see carbon, carbon, carbon,

carbon bonded together in complex ways with other hydrogens.

And they get much more complex than this,

and they can be hundreds or thousands

or tens of thousands of atoms bonded together.

But you can see

that this is very different from these simple molecules.

And what assembly theory does is characterize the complexity

of molecules in a way

that tells us when something is complex enough

so that it must have been made by life.

Oneskipydino asks,

Can someone give me a short explanation

of the Drake equation, and the probability

of us being alone?

I happen to have a copy right here.

It's a way of thinking through the probability

of extraterrestrial life that was devised

by Astronomer Frank Drake in the early 1960s.

Frank Drake was the first one

to actually point a radio telescope elsewhere from Earth,

and start to listen to see if he can find alien signals.

And to help think through the probability

of finding those signals,

he came up with this really pretty simple equation.

N is the number of communicating civilizations out there.

R, that's just the rate of star formation in the galaxy.

F-sub-P, the probability of planet formation

around those stars.

N-sub-e, the number of habitable planets per star.

F-sub-l, the fraction of planets

that have an origin of life.

F-sub-i is getting into more speculative territory.

That's the fraction of planets with life

where intelligent life evolves.

And of course, we only have one example, it's Earth.

And then f-sub-c is even more speculative.

That's the fraction of planets with intelligent life

that have communicating civilizations that are sending

or possibly receiving messages.

Finally, multiplied by L or the average longevity

of communicating civilizations.

If communicating civilizations don't last long,

perhaps because they do themselves in through nuclear war

or climate change or some other process,

then the numbers suggest

that civilizations that we could communicate with are

probably very rare and might be hard to find out there.

On the other hand, if L is long,

because some civilizations can last a very long time,

they solve their problems, they learn how

to live sustainably on a planet, then the math works out

that there should be lots of civilizations out there

that we can find.

So the numbers vary widely depending

on how you estimate some of these unknown factors.

But some of these factors we do now know pretty well.

We know the star formation rate in the galaxy.

And importantly, we've recently discovered

that planets are very, very common.

That tells us that as long as the origin

of life is not super, super rare, there must be lots

and lots of planets out there with life.

Chadfromthefuture asked, Why doesn't

the Europa Clipper deploy something into the moon

to check for life?

At one point, there was the idea

of including a lander on Europa Clipper.

But it was decided that the real point

of this mission is just to characterize Europa

and decide if it is habitable.

We'll then know which locations on the surface are

the right locations to send a lander.

Whereas now, we would sort of be guessing it.

Also, it costs a lot to send a mission to Europa,

and the more complex you make the mission with an orbiter

and a lander and other pieces, the price goes up,

and then you're less likely to have the mission at all.

So, if Clipper does confirm, as we suspect,

that Europa is a habitable world, you can be sure

that in the future, we will be sending landers

to directly search for life there.

Browner555 asks, What is Area 51 actually used for?

Well, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.

No. [laughs] Just kidding.

Area 51 is a place

where experimental military aircraft are tested.

This is common knowledge, and that's all I know,

and I've seen no evidence that it's anything else.

Rinsetheplates_first asks, What is the Fermi Paradox?

So the Fermi paradox is named

after the great Italian American physicist Enrico Fermi,

who famously asked, Where is everybody?

With all the possible life forms

and civilizations in the galaxy,

and with a galaxy that is billions of years old,

why aren't there obvious signs of extraterrestrial life?

That's really what we mean by the Fermi Paradox.

In my view, it's not really a paradox

'cause we haven't really looked yet, very thoroughly.

With SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

Jill Tarter, who's one

of our great SETI scientists, has likened it to,

if the Universe is an ocean,

we've basically searched a teacup full of water.

Even though we've been searching with radio telescopes

for 60 years now,

if you look at the number of stars we've looked at carefully

and the frequencies we've analyzed compared to the amount

of search space there is,

that it's just a teacup in the ocean.

So we could have easily missed it.

InfinityScientist asks, What kind

of techno signature could be detected

from a very faraway galaxy?

That's an interesting one.

If you were an alien looking at Earth, you might notice

that our atmosphere has changed.

You might notice lights from our civilization, those kinds

of things we call techno signatures.

Just any observation that can betray the existence

of some kind of technological activity or civilization.

The only kind of techno signature I can think

of from a very far away galaxy would be some kind

of incredibly advanced civilization

that is actually manipulating the geometry

of that galaxy in some way.

Creating things like Dyson spheres,

these large structures in a solar system that are meant

to gather all the solar energy from that star

and power their technology.

And that would put out an unusual infrared signature.

So, we actually have the ability to look

for things like that.

When we're talking about the possible abilities

of very advanced technologies,

you almost have to get very out there.

Like Arthur C Clarke said,

Any sufficiently advanced technology may be

indistinguishable from magic.

And the fact is, if you look at how fast technology changes,

it's very hard to say it would be impossible

for some civilization

to create these astroengineering works

that would be visible from distant galaxies.

Ulteriorkid324 asks, What is SETI?

Is it just people listening to alien radio stations?

So, SETI stands for

the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

and it's been mostly radio searches.

But more recently, now we have what we call optical SETI,

where the idea is that they may not be sending radio pulses,

they may be sending laser pulses.

So with optical SETI, we look in optical visible wavelengths

for laser pulses from other stars.

We also shouldn't confuse SETI with METI,

which is Messages to Extraterrestrial Intelligence,

which is more controversial.

Some people are opposed to METI for a couple of reasons.

One is they think it's arrogant to assume

that any one person or program

or institution could speak for all of Earth.

User0301 asks,

NASA announced it has detected a gas

on a planet 120 light-years away

that might indicate life, how?

So, one of the things we do is we look for

what we call bio signature gases in their atmospheres.

A report was published

that a chemical called dimethyl sulfide had been detected

in the atmosphere of an exoplanet called K2-18B

that might have a habitable watery environment,

which would be a very exciting thing to find.

Dimethyl sulfide is a gas that, on Earth,

is associated with life largely,

although there are other ways to make it.

So they're not sure that dimethyl sulfide has

really been found on this exoplanet.

So, as far as how we detect gases in a distant atmosphere

of an exoplanet, we use spectroscopy.

Basically, we observe the amount of light at a range

of wavelengths across the visible, the infrared,

the ultraviolet spectrum on an exoplanet.

And we've learned

that patterns in those spectra reveal

the existence of different gases.

So, for instance, this is a spectrum

from an exoplanet called WASP-96 b.

You can see some of these peaks and valleys.

This is a peak that indicates water, which is pretty amazing

because water is one of the key gases

for thinking about life in the Universe.

Here's a question from the AskHistorians Subreddit.

Are there any compelling cases

of UFO/UAP sightings in history?

From an astrobiology perspective,

the short answer is no.

There are a lot of phenomena in our atmosphere

that have not been characterized yet.

There have been things discovered recently,

strange high altitude, lightning formations called sprites

that were reported and dismissed,

and then they turn out to be real.

I would not doubt

that there are strange things in our atmosphere

that have not yet been identified,

whether they are any indication of alien technology,

to me, that's a kind of last resort explanation.

Even if they are technology,

I would probably say it's much more likely

that they are human technology that some humans know about

and other humans don't.

Why we have to resort to aliens to explain this?

To me, if anything that seems kind of a lack of imagination

or really a big leap that I wouldn't be prepared

to make without some more specific evidence for that.

@Redacted Media asks, What if we could see

and interact with the shadow biome?

What if there's some other form of life on Earth

that we're not even fully aware of?

What if there's another form

of life, perhaps hiding underground

or in some place that we think is very uninhabitable

because our kind of life couldn't exist there?

You know, highly acidic places

or places that are so extreme

that we think life couldn't exist.

That, in fact, does exist on Earth.

And that's the notion of a shadow biosphere.

And by its very nature,

the concept implies something we haven't

really encountered or thought of yet.

It's a kind of question that's worth our keeping in mind

as astrobiologists, so that we don't assume

that we know everything about life,

when in fact, we're just beginning

to understand the possibilities for life in the Universe.

Well, here's another good question.

Was there ever life on Mars?

What I can tell you is the more we've studied Mars,

the more we've learned about its earliest environment.

It seems to be similar to the early environment

of Earth at the time when the origin

of life is believed to have happened.

There are dried-up river valleys, there are dried-up lakes

with waterborne sediments, there are flood valleys,

all kinds of signs that Mars, when it was young, was a wet

and warmer place with a more Clement climate, with lakes,

with flowing water, and most likely with organic molecules.

So, Mars, we believe, had the conditions

for an origin of life.

Have we found evidence for early life on Mars yet?

No, but we're searching for it.

And that's one of the reasons we have these Mars rovers,

and hopefully, someday, bringing samples back,

so that we can examine those rocks

in our laboratories on Earth,

and identify, for sure, whether there was life on Mars.

Pietin11 asks,

Would a Venus sample return mission be possible?

It wouldn't be that easy

because Venus has a very thick atmosphere.

You can't see the surface

because it's surrounded by these thick clouds

of sulfuric acids, so battery acid.

So it's not an easy place to explore or to get to.

Ultimately, we would really like to do so.

Having samples on Earth is so valuable

because instead of having to send your little instruments

up there, and do the experiments

and radio home the results,

you can have a whole Earth laboratory.

You can have all the time that you want,

and using all the resources of our laboratory.

Pokoirl asks, Is a habitable planet

with no tectonic activity plausible?

We're still trying to understand the nature

of habitability, but one thing

that's certainly true about Earth,

the one habitable planet we know is that possibility

for life here is facilitated by plate tectonics,

by the motion of the Earth's surface, driven by the motion

of the interior, which moves the surface around,

and not only makes mountains and Earthquakes, and all that,

but brings nutrients continually to the surface,

and sort of renews the surface of the Earth.

Keeps it fertile.

We definitely think tectonic activity is related

to habitability.

And you would imagine for a planet to be habitable,

there needs to be some kind of ongoing geological activity.

Is it absolutely required?

We don't know.

For instance, there are these ocean worlds like Europa

and other places where habitability could just be

on the inside,

and maybe you would not have tectonic activity

in the outside if there were other energy sources

and way of recycling nutrients.

Coochieman127 asked,

Do you think we detect intelligent life

within the next 100 years?

So, with the James Webb Space Telescope, we're just getting

to the point where we can identify gases

in exoplanet atmospheres, and with future space telescopes,

then we will have the ability to really say

what's in that atmosphere

of this exoplanet and that exoplanet.

And once we can do that, then we at least have a chance

of funding some kind of techno signature.

Similarly, our radio searches are getting

much more sophisticated.

So, the completeness with which we're examining the rest

of the Universe is increasing rapidly, which makes me think,

again, if the aliens are there waiting to be found,

that within the next 100 years,

we have a pretty decent chance of finding them.

So those are all the questions for today.

And thanks for watching Alien Support.

If Russian bots exist, do Chinese bots also exist?

I think first of all, you should look down at the comments

in this video and you'll probably get a taste

of whether there are any Chinese bots.

I'm Michael Beckley. I study modern China.

Let's answer your questions from the internet.

This is China Support.

[upbeat music]

S-Sheepherder wants to know,

What do westerners get wrong about China?

Well, China's really big.

There's 19 countries around China,

and so that big military

that China has is spread quite thin

having to defend all of China's borders.

Or the big economy, you have to feed one

of the largest populations on the planet.

You have to maintain control over those people.

That all drains resources from the country

and means just that it's much more complicated

to analyze China.

You have both a lot of assets,

but also a lot of liabilities.

@snoowlions wants to know, When did modern China start?

Let's answer that with a timeline.

Let's start in 1911 with the collapse of the Qing dynasty

that ends thousands of years off and on of imperial rule.

China then collapses into the warlord era,

which is every bit as bad as it sounds.

Then the Japanese in the 1930s

really step up their aggression in China,

conquering big parts of it,

and basically starting World War II in East Asia.

The Japanese are defeated in 1945,

but at that point, the Chinese Civil War comes roaring back

between the Communists and the Nationalists.

The Communists win that Civil War in 1949.

They found the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong.

China initially sides with the Soviet Union in the Cold War,

but about halfway through,

they realize that the Soviets are actually their main enemy.

That paves the way for in the US President Richard Nixon

to go to Beijing.

And at that point, China and the United States

basically become allies in the rest of the Cold War.

The Soviet Union collapses in 1991

and that sets the stage for the US and China

to become major trading and investment partners.

That culminates in 2001

with China's entry into the World Trade Organization.

But especially after the 2008 financial crisis,

you start to see the United States

and China looking at each other more like rivals

feeling like their economies are under strain

and that the trade relationship

is not working out as well as they had hoped.

And that really paves the way

for the era that we're currently in,

which is one of tremendous hostility

between the United States and China.

hecubiss asks, Why would China even want to invade Taiwan?

So first of all, Taiwan is the seat

of a rival Chinese government that is democratic,

essentially tied security wise to the United States.

And so if you're the Chinese Communist Party

and you insist that this is all your territory,

you can't have this renegade regime

going in a different direction.

Taiwan is where the nationalists fled to

when they lost the Chinese Civil War.

So they want to finish that job.

It's smack-dab at the epicenter of the East China Sea

and the South China Sea

where about half of world trade flows through.

So this is probably, pound for pound,

the most strategic important waterway on the planet.

And Taiwan itself is, you can see,

the center cork of what the Chinese call

the first island chain in East Asia

that runs from Korea and the Japanese islands

down through the Philippines.

These are all American allies.

They host American troops.

China has no California, it has no west coast.

Its only coast is completely hemmed in by rival powers

that are allied with the United States.

Smashing Taiwan and taking it over

would give China an unsinkable aircraft carrier

in the most important waterways,

and blast a hole, not just geographically,

in the US alliance system in East Asia,

but really in the credibility of US alliances

'cause no one would trust the United States

if the US just let Taiwan go down.

Every single Chinese leader has said,

It's only a question of time.

We're gonna take Taiwan one of these days.

Xi Jinping has said that it's a situation

that cannot be passed down generation to generation,

which some analysts worry means

he intends to do this on his watch.

BW asks, Is there something America can learn from China?

Is there something that they're doing right?

China is really good

at mobilizing resources for national missions.

For example, China has installed more solar and wind power

than any other country.

China is the world's largest trade power in the world

and has forged trade relationships

with the majority of the world's countries.

And China has built infrastructure faster

and on greater scale than any country in human history,

then just the miraculous development

of bringing hundreds of millions of people

from living on less than $2 a day

to average disposable incomes of 5,000 to $10,000 a year.

That is a tremendous, almost miraculous undertaking

that China has been able to pull off.

And I think that only comes

from having a sense of national unity

and a willingness to pool resources for national purposes.

The United States,

it's a dynamic, open, decentralized system,

but the downside is it also generally does not mobilize

its resources on a national scale and unify

unless it's really confronted with a crisis

like a global war or a depression.

So there are areas of the United States

that are neglected in terms of infrastructure.

There are neighborhoods that could be built up.

There are education systems that are failing.

And so that type of rallying resources and coming together

is something that the US I think could look to to China.

But obviously you don't want to go too far

because part of what allows China to do that

is just a lack of civil and political rights

for the Chinese people.

@greatshistorian asks, Who is winning

the current trade war between America and China?

China is very much an investment and export-driven economy.

This trade war is really bad

for a lot of those major export industries.

There's been lots of closures, especially in eastern China.

There's been mass layoffs even just in the short time

that this trade war has been going on.

Now on the American side, the consumer market

is roughly three times the size of China's.

So consumers are the ones

who are being hurt by this trade war

because they're gonna have to pay higher prices for goods

that were manufactured in China.

Xi Jinping cares a lot less about GDP growth.

He cares about power

and about developing self-reliant, strong industries.

And if this trade war enables China to decouple

and reduce its dependence on the West,

I think he counts that as a win,

even if it crimps economic growth in the short term.

And for the United States under the Trump administration,

they similarly want to decouple from China

because they view it as a national security threat.

I see these two countries as having a distinct interest

in trying to get away from each other economically.

These dependencies, they both seem

to want to push those away.

ChaseTheTaco.

Serious question. Is China truly a Communist country?

I know it seems crazy

if you look at the Shanghai skyline,

you fly in through the Beijing airport.

That is the gilded veneer

on the outside that's been built up.

But if you look at the super-structure of the economy,

what's actually the driving force behind it?

It's a very strong state presence.

All of the land in the country

is owned by the Chinese Communist Party.

The energy industry, the banking sector is state-owned,

90%+ of the financial assets flowing around the country,

so these are all what Lenin called

the commanding heights of the economy.

And it can produce incredible output.

It can produce shiny high-speed rail,

it can produce gleaming skyscrapers.

But this is sort of like a new modern form

of a communist system

where you still have the party running the show economically

insisting on a one-party state

and a dictator ruling over it all.

Take Jack Ma, the former head of Alibaba,

has a major company in China,

and he gave a speech a few years back criticizing the way

that the government was running the economy.

He had his wings totally clipped.

He was sent out to Tokyo,

he had his empire completely dismantled

and now has basically had to come crawling back.

You've had many other billionaires simply just disappear.

And so at the end of the day,

even the high-flying titans of China's economy know

that their livelihoods depend very much

on their relationship with the Chinese Communist Party,

which is why you see many of the top titans of industry

in China in the National People's Hall

during these major conclaves sitting next to Xi Jinping

because they're effectively part

of the same-party system that he operates.

DizzyMajor5 wants to know,

What do the Chinese people think of Mao Zedong?

Is he considered good or bad?

The standard answer taught in Chinese schools

is that he was 70% right, but 30% wrong.

Here's Mao as a young revolutionary.

He was a journalist for a long time.

He actually wrote a whole pamphlet in 1940

about democracy and freedom in China.

Of course, once he becomes Chairman Mao,

a lot of that stuff goes away.

The 70% right was he unified the country

which had been ripped apart by decades of civil war.

He instituted a mass education campaign

'cause he wanted to lift China up.

So that led to widespread literacy.

He wanted women to be active participants

in the labor force.

Now, in terms of the bad, his so-called Great Leap Forward,

which was this scheme

to turn China into a superpower in just a few years,

took millions of peasants off of their farms,

put them in communes,

had them melt down their pots and pans.

As a result, the food supply ran out

and 45 million people starved to death

or were beaten or shot along the way.

And then in order to insulate and protect himself,

he then launched the Cultural Revolution

where he basically turned

the Chinese people on the Communist Party

to purge many of his rivals.

That probably killed another million to 2 million people.

So ruthless, brutal, but effective

in terms of bringing China together,

which for much of Chinese history has not been the case.

@SuperCoach137 asks, How did the one-child policy

work out for China?

It resulted in several hundred million abortions

when people, starting in the late 1970s,

weren't allowed to have more than one child.

You'd be subject to massive fines,

equivalent in some cases to a year or more of your income

if you had a second child.

In the '50s and '60s, China had a massive baby boom

because Mao Zedong wanted to turn China into a superpower.

So he encouraged Chinese families to have lots of children.

So then when China did a 180

and implemented the one-child policy in the late 1970s,

you had this baby boom generation

coming into the prime of their working lives

and they had relatively few children to take care of

'cause they weren't allowed to have them

and they had relatively few elderly parents to care for

because so many of them end up dying

in the famines and the Cultural Revolution.

So in the '90s and 2000s,

you had anywhere between 10 to 15 working-age adults

available to support every elderly retiree

in China's population.

That's two to three times the global average.

It's five times what the United States currently has.

And so as a result, China's population

was primed for economic productivity

and demographers think that alone explains

about 25% of China's rapid economic growth

over the last 30 to 40 years.

The problem for China is now the situation is flipping

where that huge baby boom generation

are retiring and falling onto the backs

of this tiny one-child generation.

That 10:15 ratio is gonna collapse to 2:1.

In the 2030s, China's gonna lose somewhere

like 70 million working-age adults in the next 10 years

and gain 130 million senior citizens.

That's gonna be catastrophic for China's fiscal balance,

for its economic productivity.

@RightSideofMB says, Siri, what are Chinese ghost cities?

Ghost cities refer to entire apartment complexes, airports,

shopping malls that are either mostly or entirely empty.

And it's a result of China's economic model,

which is very much about collecting the resources

of the Chinese people under the state

and then plowing them into certain industries,

including into the real estate sector.

It works really well for an authoritarian government

'cause it's easy to pay off cronies who own the companies

that are doing all of the building.

The problem is it runs amuck.

These companies, they're getting paid

whether the apartments are occupied or not.

So they build a bunch of stuff

but then people aren't moving into them

and now that China's population is declining,

there is going to be ever-lowering demand

for a lot of this base infrastructure.

MehmetTopal wants to know,

How much power does Xi Jinping hold personally?

Is he an absolutist like Louis XIV or like Stalin?

I'm gonna reserve a certain category

for divine-right monarchs like Louis XIV

and distinguish that from Xi Jinping.

So Xi Jinping is probably

the most powerful leader since Mao Zedong.

He's made himself president of everything for life,

but at the end of the day, he's one guy.

And so his ability to pay attention

to everything that's going on in his vast sprawling country

is inherently limited.

So the real estate crisis that's going on,

he's demanded that people be more frugal

and not speculate on real estate,

but the market is kind of doing what it's going to do.

And as a result, you still have that ongoing crisis.

Zero COVID.

You know, he locked down Chinese people

in their apartments for months on end.

At a certain point the Chinese people had it

and you saw protests emerging

that seemed to have encouraged Xi

to back down and undo that policy.

And he also has to worry about rivals in the party,

which is why he's embarked on

this massive anti-corruption campaign, purging more than

a million senior CCP officials along the way.

We do know a bit about his backstory.

His father was a high-ranking official

serving under Mao Zedong, but he was purged,

and in fact, Xi himself and his family were purged

during the Cultural Revolution.

Xi was sent out to the countryside

to basically dig a bunch of holes.

His father was humiliated,

Xi himself was denounced by his own mother,

and his half sister died during the Cultural Revolution.

It's all speculation, but people think this may have had

a big effect on him and that's what he thinks of

when he thinks of rule by the people,

which may explain partially why he seems so committed

to centralizing all power under himself

and basically installing himself

to the point that he's literally written himself

into the constitution

and obligates other people in China

to read what he calls Xi Jinping Thought,

which is his own sort of philosophy

about how to guide the country.

@nic_moneypenny wants to know,

What was China's ultimate role in the COVID-19 pandemic?

We don't know for sure

because China, the government,

has gone to extraordinary lengths

to cover up how COVID emerged

and details about the virus.

We know that in late 2019, they basically got rid

of a lot of their virus samples

that were related to coronaviruses.

They floated conspiracy theories

that a virus actually came to China from frozen food

that was imported from outside of the country

and they didn't really allow international inspectors

until very late.

And even then, when the WHO came

to try to figure out where the virus came from,

it was a highly scripted,

almost sort of like North Korean tour around the facilities.

And as a result, we just don't know where it came from.

The two major theories are that it either emerged

from this wet market in Wuhan

because of the animals

that were being eaten and slaughtered there.

The other major theory is that it emerged

from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

which is China's premier place for studying coronaviruses.

And we know the virus itself has certain features

that you really only see

if it's been modified in a lab rather than naturally.

The bottom line is, we don't know,

but there's a lot of circumstantial evidence

that it was done in this lab,

which is a center of not just Chinese research,

but of a multinational research attempt

to analyze coronaviruses.

@JerryDunleavy asks, Whatever happened to Tank Man?

And how many people did the Chinese Communist Party murder

at Tiananmen Square?

So what Jerry is referring to is that famous image

of a man standing in front of several tanks

that are rolling into Tiananmen Square

to run over demonstrators, mainly students,

that were protesting there in 1989.

We have no idea what happened to Tank Man,

he has never been heard of since.

It wasn't just a crackdown in Beijing and Tiananmen Square,

there were massive protests

in basically every provincial capital around China.

More than 80 cities had mass demonstrations

that were then forcibly put down.

According to the party,

roughly 200 to 300 people were killed.

But most Western estimates suggest

it was 10 times that amount.

The way that the Tiananmen Square protests

are often portrayed is as a pro-democracy demonstration

by the Chinese people.

And certainly there were elements of that.

A lot of the students in Tiananmen Square

were calling for more democratic governance.

They built a giant replica of the Statue of Liberty

in the middle of Tiananmen Square.

But really the crisis starts

and the reason why

it spreads across the country was economic.

There was massive inflation.

This led to massive demonstrations.

A lot of people weren't being paid

for jobs that they were employed to do by the state.

And also keep in mind that communist regimes

were starting to crumble, especially across Eastern Europe.

So the tail end of the Cold War

and this belief that the legitimacy,

the functioning of a communist system is under question

and led to mass demonstrations

and even a split among the elites

in the Chinese Communist Party.

Since then, now the Communist Party is very much,

We have to stay together.

We either stay together or we hang separately.

I think that informs a lot of the emphasis

on repression put on in China today.

MiltonMerloXD wants to know,

How does censorship work in China?

So there's an actual Propaganda Department,

that's what it's called in China.

They set guidelines about what is allowed to be said

and what is not allowed to be said.

It's all pretty predictable.

You know, criticizing the Chinese Communist Party,

promoting democracy, Western liberal methods

are all kind of looked down upon and and squelched.

What the regime then does

is they have this vast great firewall

to control the internet

where they use a combination of artificial intelligence

and then hundreds of thousands of people

that are actually working to monitor China's internet,

which is partially sealed off.

What the censors really go after

is not so much people going off

and mouthing criticism about the leader,

but much more about trying to organize politically,

whether it's a house church, or student group

or anything where you get people together who can then talk

and then rally and potentially grow their numbers,

that looks too much like the start

of an alternative political party.

And the Chinese Communist Party says, No.

We have a monopoly on power.

We're the only political party

that's allowed to be had in this system.

And that seems to be what the censorship regime

is primarily dedicated to squelching out.

@mbateman says, Wait, China's domestic surveillance system

is actually called Skynet?

I know, it's kind of on the nose.

It is called Skynet.

The idea is that there's hundreds of millions

of surveillance cameras

that have been set up around the country

as if it's a net coming from the sky.

China has pioneered methods to take all of the images

that are being absorbed by these cameras

and then use artificial intelligence

and speech and facial recognition technology,

even gait recognition,

so how you walk can be identified.

And at this point they're starting

to export elements of this system to more than 80 countries.

Cuba, Pakistan, Cambodia

have all imported aspects of this system.

And so some scholars think this is the emergence

of a new type of authoritarian system

that seems to have a lot of advantages

in terms of population control.

@Spencemo_c asks, How does China's

social credit system work?

So in addition to video cameras

and speech and facial recognition technology,

the Communist Party has access to your financial statements,

to your police record, your education,

any kind of disciplinary action.

And so what they've done is basically created

a dossier on every single citizen.

And so what they can then do

is instantly punish Chinese citizens

by saying, Oh you, you jaywalked.

That's a point.

And so now you're gonna have to pay more if you want a loan

or you may not be able to travel as freely

or it may take longer to get your passport

when you go to a government office.

There essentially is like a score

and sometimes they'll actually post names

of people who have been blacklisted

because they've committed certain crimes

or they've been infraction of certain regulations

encouraging people to report on each other.

ItsAllOver_Again wants to know,

Why is China so God-like in the world of manufacturing?

Well, it's so God-like,

because it's designed to be God-like.

You have an authoritarian system

that essentially obligates the Chinese people

to put their life savings in a state-owned bank.

That means the government has tons of money,

a war chest that they can then deploy

at what they call strategic industries.

So they've spent hundreds of billions of dollars

every single year for more than a decade.

That's 10 times what other rich countries

in the OECD or the United States spend

as a share of their GDPs.

So in for example, the electric vehicle sector,

China has spent about $230 billion.

Semiconductors, biotechnology,

all of these key strategic industries.

And at the same time, many foreign companies

have sent over lots of investment and training.

So Apple, for example,

has spent about $275 billion in investment in China.

That's more than the Marshall Plan

that the United States used

to help Europe recover from World War II.

Apple also trained millions of Chinese workers, 28 million,

which is more than the labor force of California.

And also a lot of this is determined by their geography.

China has a long coastline right in the heart of East Asia,

which is the most economically dynamic region in the world.

So many of the world's supply chains

flow through these waters.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, you had China setting up

what they called Special Economic Zones,

especially in the Southeast and places like Shenzhen

as well as in Fujian province.

In some industries,

whether it's electric vehicles or in rare earths,

China currently produces anywhere between 60 to 90%

of the global market.

And now China has ports lining up and down its coastline

that serve as export platforms essentially

for the rest of the world.

In addition, China has extremely low labor costs

because several hundred million people

from the poor provinces in the west,

they move to the richer east coast provinces

to work in factories for very low wages.

But that provides essentially a bottomless source

of cheap-but-effective labor

for China's manufacturing juggernaut.

Roxi USA asks, What percentage of pharmaceuticals

does the US import in from China?

In terms of antibiotics, basic antibiotics,

it's upwards of 90% that include

at least some ingredients that are made in China.

And so this has become another national security threat

where the United States worries

that China could potentially cut the United States off

from basic pharmaceuticals

if there's some kind of crisis over Taiwan.

Whether China would actually do that remains to be seen.

@toxiccowboy1 asks, Are we headed to war with China?

It's not completely out of the question.

In addition to the conflict over Taiwan,

there's also the risk of a war around the Philippines.

That conflict really stems

over who controls the South China Sea

where a lot of trade passes through

where most of China's oil imports pass through.

Under international law,

the Philippines gets 12 miles out from their coastline

that is their territory,

and then another 200 miles out from their coastline

that is their exclusive economic zone.

China says, No.

That is all, that's just all Chinese territory.

And they've been building artificial islands there.

They've been turning them into military bases

and they formed what they call a maritime militia.

So thousands of fishing boats, coast guard vessels

and naval ships that are basically shoving other countries

out of their exclusive economic zone

and confining them

to narrow bands along their own coastlines.

The Philippines took China to court in 2016,

the World Court, which ruled that China's historical claims

to the South China Sea are null and void.

And in recent years China's really been turning

the screw on the Philippines,

one, I think to invalidate that ruling

and shatter its credibility,

but second, 'cause the Philippines

has started opening up new military bases

for the United States

'cause they say, We need some protection from China

so that we can have access to our territorial waters

in our exclusive economic zone.

The Chinese have a saying,

You should kill a chicken to scare the monkeys.

Meaning you should make a bloody example

out of a relatively weak adversary

to send a message to the more powerful ones.

The Philippines have very little

offensive air or naval capability.

So you just have to worry that Chinese would look at them

as a very juicy target; weak but symbolically important.

@adamncheck asks, Is TikTok just a China app

to make Americans do dumb stuff to get likes and views

and keep us distracted while they take over?

The Chinese version of TikTok,

you're only allowed to use it for 15 minutes

to an hour or so depending on your age and status.

And they also try to insert educational wholesome content

in addition to all the fun cat videos

and everything else that people are watching.

So I think the Chinese know

that this system is maybe not the best thing

that kids should be spending all day on.

TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company.

Under Chinese law, ByteDance is required

to hand over data to Beijing whenever

and in however much it wants it.

It's like putting a Chinese spy balloon in your cell phone

with your biometric data,

everything you've liked and disliked.

There's been studies done suggesting

that the algorithm in TikTok in the American version

was promoting certain views

like after the October 7th massacre in Israel,

more pro-Hamas views were being amplified

or pro-Russian views on the Ukraine conflict.

@NOYK1847 asks, If Russian bots exist,

do Chinese bots also exist?

I think first of all,

you should look down at the comments in this video

and you'll probably get a taste

of whether there are any Chinese bots.

China, it's been well documented,

it uses both bots

as well as what is called a 50-Cent Army

basically has a bunch of mainly kids and young adults

who are paid 50 Chinese cents

per internet post that they make

to destroy, undermine the credibility of messages

that maybe cut against the Chinese Communist Party.

It's reported there's probably

several hundred thousand people

that are essentially employed as internet trolls

by the Chinese Communist Party, in addition

to obviously using artificial intelligence and bots.

@Psalm_Sixtynine asks, Why would China want Tibet?

I think it becomes very clear

when you look at a map of China

and you can see that most of it

is the highest mountains in the world, the Himalayas,

and a lot of it is also desert.

And so most of China's population is packed in here

and they're desperate for water as well as strategic space

to defend themselves against enemies.

And so Tibet, which is in this area here,

is highly strategic.

For one, a lot of the glaciers up in the Himalayas

are where the major rivers of Asia start,

both flowing down into China

as well as flowing down into Southeast Asia and into India.

So if China can control that territory,

it controls the source of vital water supplies.

At the same time, China and India,

which is now the most populous country on the planet,

have a longstanding rivalry,

and Tibet is the high ground

literally looking down onto India.

In addition, the Chinese Communist Party

essentially inherited the borders

of the previous Qing dynasty empire,

which included Tibet led by the Dalai Lama.

And so when China took over Tibet and conquered it in 1951,

the Dalai Lama fled to India

and has been running a government in exile

in India ever since.

This next question is from TapestryGirl.

Mom says China could take over the United States

because they own our debt.

China does own some US debt. It's in the 3 to 4% range.

It topped out at about 7% about a decade ago,

generally in the form of treasury bills.

And a lot of this emerges

just from the economic relationship

between the United States and China

where China is exporting a lot of goods

to the United States.

And the United States will often pay for that,

essentially with a piece of paper that says

IOU in the form of a treasury bill.

Analysts have looked at whether

they could use this as a course of weapon

and basically concluded

they'd be shooting themselves in the foot.

The value of that asset would suddenly plummet.

Japan owns more US debt than China does.

So I don't think that this is a unique China thing

or that they could use it as some type of weapon

to coerce the United States.

Let's take a question from Quora.

Is modern China more influenced

by Confucianism or Marxism?

I would say both because they lead in similar directions.

Marxism-Leninism stresses the idea

of public or communal ownership of the means of production

to produce wealth.

That is owned by the state in China.

It's led by what Lenin would call the vanguard party

staffed by a top leader that is making decisions

on behalf of the people.

And that's consistent with certain elements of Confucianism.

Confucianism obviously has a long lineage,

thousands of years in China.

Confucius, a philosopher who emphasized a natural harmony,

people knowing their place in society,

that everyone has a certain role to perform in that society,

and that you have to have a benevolent leader

that leads on behalf of the people.

That obviously appeals very much

to Chinese dynasties over the millennia.

You have Xi Jinping today grafting that on

to a Marxist-Leninist structure of the party.

@Gus_802 asked, What happened

with the Chinese spy balloon hysteria?

In January, 2023, the United States detected

a balloon floating over areas

including a nuclear missile silo in Montana.

What it was carrying

was all this advanced surveillance equipment

that was about the size of a regional jet airliner.

So we're talking about

a major piece of hardware floating around.

China's done this in more than 40 countries,

in Japan, over Taiwan,

they've been floating balloons

even over potentially over American bases in Europe.

And there's a fear that China is testing out

this alternative surveillance system.

Because balloons emit almost no radar signature,

they're really hard to detect.

They hover around 60,000 feet, which is higher

than a commercial airliner but below satellites

in this area where people really aren't looking.

It gives China eyes and ears over sensitive US sites

that otherwise they wouldn't have.

The US sent a fighter jet up eventually to shoot it down

and then the US grabbed all of the technology that was there

and observed the balloon's flight.

That might have actually helped US intelligence

more than Chinese intelligence.

@all4stops asks, Who is winning the tech war

between China and the United States?

I think they are each dominating

different types of technologies.

The United States is still doing quite well

in high-value areas.

So advanced computer chips, aerospace,

the complicated jet engines

that you need to fly a jumbo jet or a fighter.

China on the other hand dominates scale

taking existing technologies from other countries

and then mass producing highly effective,

cost-efficient electric vehicles,

run-of-the-mill computer chips,

rare earths, pharmaceuticals, medical PPE.

There's so many areas where China

can just flood the market with sheer scales.

Both of those types of technologies

are really important for a modern economy.

They're also very important for military power.

So each in their own way is sort of winning in some ways

but also has major vulnerabilities.

@JoeBart85120716 asked, Does China own American farmland?

Yes, China does own American farmland.

It's like 0.05% of American farmland.

But some of this farmland is near American military bases,

especially Air Force bases

including some of those where American strategic forces,

nuclear forces could be taking off.

And so there is a fear that if China has this land,

they can put things on it, explosives, missiles,

that could potentially attack American bases

if there is some kind of major war

and destroy US aircraft on the ground

before they even get up into the air.

We don't know the details on that.

You'd have to get classified information,

but the amount of farmland is small,

the location is a little bit scary and questionable.

cakeba asks, Can someone explain Hong Kong to me?

So Hong Kong was a British colony

after the first Opium War in 1839

all the way up until 1997

where Britain agreed to hand back Hong Kong to China

and in exchange, China pledged to grant Hong Kong a, quote,

High degree of autonomy.

'Cause within Hong Kong there was a different rule of law.

There was an independent judiciary.

So you saw massive protests there

over the last five or six years when China

was basically trying to erode a lot of those freedoms,

crack down on the press,

crack down on the free flow of investment,

and also on the way

that the Hong Kong government is selected

and the Chinese government passed national security laws

that made it possible for them to remove protestors,

take them to mainland China.

So at this point it seems like Hong Kong

has basically become another large cosmopolitan,

but ultimately Chinese city

run by the Chinese Communist Party.

IronLover64 asks, How does the quality of life

for the low class in China compare

to that of the United States, let's say in a red state.

So why don't we compare the poorest of the poor in China

to say average wages in Mississippi,

which is the poorest state.

For China, roughly half the country

is living on something like $5 to $10 a day.

In Mississippi, that's gonna be three

to four times that amount.

There's a lot more obesity in a place like Mississippi

than there is in China.

On the other hand, in rural China

you have a severe problem of malnourishment

and rudimentary healthcare.

Researchers at Stanford went out

and they found that roughly a third of rural children,

their IQs are around 90, which is really low,

because of malnutrition from a young age,

a lack of education.

The average education level is about an eighth grade

or seventh grade level in rural China

'cause high school costs money.

And so a lot of Chinese families,

their kids will just drop out of school.

And the other issue is that your citizenship in China

is tied to your locality.

And so if Mom and Dad go

to an eastern rich coastal province to work in a factory,

they can't bring their kids with them

'cause they won't be allowed to go to school.

So they're just sending money back

and maybe only seeing their kids

a few times or maybe only once a year.

So just in terms of the basic healthcare and education level

and then just in terms of the amount of wealth

that someone in Mississippi might have

versus someone in poor rural China,

it's a very stark difference.

@Captaintrips333 asks, What's going on

with the Uyghur Muslim population in China?

So there's about 10 to 12 million Uyghur Muslims.

They live mainly in a province called Xinjiang,

which is in the western part of China.

Basically since 2017,

China set up what they call reeducation centers

or vocational education centers,

what people in the West have called concentration camps,

and what the US government deems an attempt at genocide

and basically put in a million

to a million and a half Uyghur Muslims,

so a substantial part of the population, in these centers.

We've heard from people that have come out of them

that there's a lot of indoctrination, that they are enforced

to renounce their heritage and to learn Mandarin

and basically to assimilate with Chinese society.

A big part of what the Chinese Communist Party is about

is making sure a Soviet-style collapse

never occurs in China.

And one of their theories

about why the Soviet Union broke apart

was that the Soviet Union

was like one of those Hershey chocolate bars

that's divided into little squares that you can break apart.

It was these disparate republics

that all went their own way when they suddenly could.

So there was a fear that a minority region like Xinjiang

where these Uyghurs were living

was going to try to separate from the mainland

or was gonna become a base of terrorism directed at China.

So unfortunately the Uyghur Muslims

are experiencing severe repression right now

under the Chinese Communist Party.

loefferrafael asks, Does China support

or promote communism around the world?

I don't think China's promoting communism anymore

the way that the Soviet Union

used to bankroll revolutionary movements.

They have engaged in this Belt and Road Initiative

where they've loaned out more than a trillion dollars

to more than a hundred different countries,

mainly so that those countries can employ Chinese companies

to build infrastructure on their territory.

So whether that's building ports or roads or soccer stadiums

or what the Chinese call smart city systems.

There's a port in Greece for example,

that is highly profitable,

it's an important, valuable piece of infrastructure

that China helped fund and build.

One out of every three infrastructure projects

in Sub-Saharan Africa over the last 20 years

has been built partially

or entirely by Chinese companies.

So you see a massive spread of infrastructure

and part of the reason really stems

from the 2008 Financial Crisis

and the resulting trade protectionism

that was emerging, backlash against Chinese products.

The Chinese decided, We need to open up new markets.

We can also get these countries more hooked

on our ecosystem of technology standards,

5G networks, smart city systems,

and that way we'll have dominant market share

in a lot of these areas

that are gonna be really the growth of demand

in terms of consumption going forwards.

They also bring that surveillance system

that allows would-be dictators

to keep easier tabs on their populations.

@ostenati asks, What happens when Xi dies?

Who's next in line? And will they be good for China?

I think chaos could potentially ensue

because he has not designated a successor.

He's written himself into the constitution.

He's basically treated like a demigod

in terms of Chinese propaganda.

And if you look at the history

of the Chinese Communist Party,

there has only been one completely orderly

and peaceful transition of power.

And that's when Xi himself came to power.

All of the previous leaders,

it was a vicious power struggle

and there were split authorities.

So for example, Deng Xiaoping is purged

and then eventually comes back to power

and has to put down his enemies and imprison them

in order to take the helm.

Then Jiang Zemin comes to power

after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989,

basically 'cause the Party realizes

it needs to unify behind a candidate

or they're just gonna disintegrate.

Then when Hu Jintao comes to power,

Jiang Zemin is not willing to give up a lot of his power

and he keeps himself as commander in chief

even after Hu Jintao becomes president

and general secretary of the country.

It'd be like as if Joe Biden was still head of the Pentagon

and the military and commander in chief,

even though Donald Trump

is now president here in the United States.

In other words, in Chinese politics

it's very rough-and-tumble,

even though it happens behind closed doors.

Chaos is entirely possible.

And if you just look at the broad sweep of Chinese history,

vicious power struggles tend to ensue.

Some people hope that you'll get

a Chinese Mikhail Gorbachev,

you know, the Soviet leader who made nice with the West

and liberalized a bit at home.

I think you might actually get a Chinese Vladimir Putin.

It seems like the one thing

that everyone in the Chinese Communist Party can agree on

is that the Chinese Communist Party

should continue to rule China in perpetuity.

So those are all the questions for today.

Thanks for watching China Support.

Is this on?

Is this where we take avail?

I'm Sam Rockwell. You're the boss.

Hi. This is Natasha Lyonne.

Yes, and that's Sam Rockwell.

And this is the wire what?

The WIRED [keyboard clacking]

Auto Complete Interview.

I'll buy that for a dollar.

[hands high-fiving] We're in, baby.

[upbeat music]

It's quite a monologue.,

Would you say that any dark dirty stuff happens in there?

Yeah, yeah.

[upbeat music]

Ay.

Okay, Sammy.

[Sam] How did Natasha Lyonne start acting?

I see what the game is.

My parents wanted me to start acting, so I did.

And lo and behold. There you go.

Mike Nichols, Nora Ephron, first gig, Heartburn.

Wow. And then,

PeeWee's Playhouse.

Ah, legendary.

Yeah, it depends what you like.

Johnny Thunders, no problem.

Okay, what about opera?

I'm gonna go a hard pass.

And you, Sam?

[Sam laughing]

No, no opera for me.

No? I like to listen to it.

Ah. But not sing it.

One thing we don't have in common.

[Sam chuckling] That's not true.

I like it fine.

Is Natasha Lyonne funny?

[scoffing] You kidding?

Really funny.

Not today.

[Sam laughing] But sometimes.

[Sam] Who is Natasha Lyonne in Scary Movie?

I know the answer.

Do you?

No.

I don't. Linda Blair.

Oh. The Exorcist.

Is that right?

Yes. No kidding.

Can you say this on WIRED?

Your mother sucks cocks in hell.

I had to say that

in the movie. Sure, why not?

It's a famous line.

I didn't write it.

Billy Freidkin.

Not my best work, but I'm proud of it.

[Sam] Does Natasha Lyonne [tape tearing]

speak Russian?

[Natasha speaking Russian]

That's about all.

[Natasha speaking Russian]

[card thudding]

Okay, here we go.

Can Sam Rockwell

[tape tearing] do the splits?

[scoffing] Come on. You know,

if I'm warmed up, I can do the splits.

There's no way this baby can't do the splits.

That's Bob Fosse.

Come on.

[Natasha] [tape tearing] What is

Sam Rockwell's favorite song?

I have so many, but I'm gonna go with

Gotta Give It Up, Marvin Gaye for now.

And maybe the Toots and The Maytals'

52.

You can only gave- Is My Number.

52 Is My Number.

Oh, 52 Is My Number.

That's a great song. Yeah, that's a great song.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm just going with that for now,

but I got a lotta- Sort of a modern hit.

Really came- Yeah, it is.

This is England made it famous.

A song of a summer.

I was listening to Marvin Gaye this morning.

Oh, yeah?

I've been watching Sammy Rock's dancing

since 1996.

[tape tearing] [Sam laughing]

Why is Sam Rockwell in White Lotus?

Sam, why?

Good question.

Probably Leslie Bibb, and Walt Goggins, and Mike White.

Yeah.

Mm-hmm.

Anything else you'd like to confess to

about your inner nature, Sam?

Um,

[exhaling] no. Seems like

we all learned a lot about you.

[Sam laughing]

Wild beast that you are.

[tape tearing] Where does Sam Rockwell

want to live?

Existential, Sammy. Oh.

Where the heart is.

Very you, actually.

We spent a lot of time over the last 20 years

or more running into each other.

In the East Village, yeah.

Yeah, I own Tompkins. Tompkins.

They don't own me. You won Tompkins, yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

You should have told me.

Remember that play?

I'm gonna get more clout over there.

Lie of the Mind?

Yeah, of course.

I always loved that title.

Yeah. For some reason,

I thought of that when you said in the heart.

Yeah.

One from the Heart or something.

That's right, that's another great title.

Coppola, yeah.

Here we are learning.

This is called free association.

Yeah, this is us on a bench in Tompkins Square Park.

[tape tearing] Does Sammy Rocks know kung-fu?

[Sam laughing]

It is Shaolin season, folks,

if you haven't been paying attention.

[Sam laughing] Wu-Tang Clan

is for the children.

And we're tech available.

I do not, but I did briefly mess around

with Eagle Claw Kung Fu.

It didn't last long.

Now, Sam, I'm going off book,

'cause what else are we doing with our lives?

[Sam chuckling]

Should we get involved in, like,

Tai Chi or something when we get back to New York?

I think it's good for you

And then you can speed it up and like, you know,

fuck somebody up, right? Are you open to that,

'cause I need a Tai Chi partner?

I would do it.

I would do it. Ah, thank God.

WIRED, thank you.

Bad Guys 2, thank you. I like yoga,

why wouldn't I like Tai Chi, yeah?

Easy on the yoga.

We're Tai Chi people now, Sam.

I've recently written a film,

It's called Sammy Rocks is Tai Chi.

[Sam laughing]

And I'm so excited

that you agreed to it. Yes.

So you're gonna have to go into immediate training.

Serious.

You'll see us in the park.

You're gonna have to go all in.

All in.

All in.

I'm talking more than poor Jodorowsky's son

[card thudding] prepping for

Jodorowsky's Dune.

[Sam laughing] That's how all in

we're about to go on this.

We're gonna start right now in front of,

in the parking lot of the Four Seasons.

We got more?

Oh, gosh. Look at this.

We were just riffing.

We were like a jazz album that never ended.

Okay, what movie made Natasha Lyonne famous?

Slums of Beverly Hills.

Slums of Beverly Hills, yeah.

Great movie, great performance.

Tamara Jenkins. Yeah, there you go.

Kevin Corrigan.

Yeah. Alan Arkin.

Carl Reiner.

Rita Moreno. Forget about it.

They just keep coming.

And our girl. And Marisa Tomei.

Marisa Tomei.

There we go.

Krumholtz.

Jessica Walters.

What is Natasha Lyonne's accent?

I'm a born and raised New Yorker.

Why do I talk funny?

I've seen too many old pictures.

I think I'd seen, I don't know, Rocky,

and The Godfather,

and Scarface. Sure.

Cathy Moriarty.

Maybe, like, 40 times each by the time I was 10.

And then also old-timey stuff,

like, weirdly, like, Bette Davis and stuff.

So, I mean, I just assume.

Yeah, you've got

a Bette Davis thing. That people talk funny.

Yeah, yeah. As I move through the world,

I can now see it's weird, right?

It's too late to stop.

Also, I get nervous, and so it gets weirder all the time.

I'm not doing it on purpose if it's any consolation,

and I'm sorry for it.

Actually, you know, my dad is Bugsy Siegel,

so that might be what you're hearing.

I would buy that. How much?

Does that mean if I wanna play Bugsy Siegel,

I have to go to you for the rights?

Listen, baby, if you wanna do

the Bugsy Siegel Tai Chi picture, we can talk about it.

[Sam laughing]

I know it seems crazy.

Did Bugsy do?

We got more questions.

Don't put that down. As you were, sir.

We're tech avail.

[tape tearing] What series

was Natasha Lyonne in?

Co-created Russian Doll.

That was a big one. Russian Doll.

The big East Village one.

Orange Is The New Black with Danielle Brooks.

Who were you? I directed an episode

of Awkwafina's show.

Russian Doll is closest to my heart.

Yeah, that's the one that I got

most lost in the sauce in the edit,

and Pink Floyd, and what's it all about, Alfie?

And you got to shoot it in the hood.

You got to shoot it in the East Village.

I do like walking to work and night shoots.

You like night shoots?

[scoffs] Yeah, yeah, yeah. What are you,

a fucking vampire? You don't?

I don't understand.

Did you play Fosse or you didn't play Fosse?

[Sam chuckling] Sam, what's going on?

That's an act.

Okay? Listen, ever since

you accepted the role of Bugsy Siegel is Tai Chi,

I just feel like you've changed

and become a boring person. I hope there's not

a bunch of night shoots for Bugsy Siegel Tai Chi.

Ah, I can't help it.

I hope there're splits.

Okay, we'll make 'em split. Okay, because papa

likes to go to bed early.

I know you're a night owl. If baby wants something,

baby does his splits, we'll shoot splits.

Okay, what is Natasha Lyonne natural hair color?

Oh, let me

just take these off for you. [Sam laughing]

No problem.

It's suffice to say the curtains match the drapes, kids.

Hey.

She's here every Tuesday, everyone.

My mother was a redhead.

Try the veal. [card thudding]

I'm sort of a strawberry blonde, let's call it.

[Sam chuckling]

Okay, and with that.

Yes.

Sam Rockwell cop movie. [tape tearing]

What does that mean?

Is that a question?

Well, it's sort of like they ran outta room.

I think they gave up around now, Sam.

They were like, we've done enough.

What does that mean?

Have I played a cop?

[Crew Member] I think they're talking about

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.

Ah, yes. Ah,

let's go Billboards, baby.

That was a fun role.

It's a lot going on with that role.

He's a bad guy,

and then he learns the path to sort of,

I don't know, spirituality.

Did you love Martin McDonagh?

I loved Martin McDonagh.

Frances McDormand? I love Frances McDormand.

Did you get an Oscar for that?

Zeljko Ivanek.

I got, yes, I got the gold dude.

And I'm so sorry, where is that Oscar right now, Sam?

Do you have eyes on it?

I tie it to my toothbrush

so that I never- Oh God, that seems sensible.

Yeah.

I'm never without it, so I'm always reminded.

Much deserved.

Well, it feels like you should have

at least six or seven by now.

[Sam] Sam Rockwell, Bad Guys.

Another sort of missing then.

Another strange question. These are just-

Sort a non-sequitur.

Yeah, they're just kind of free-associating now.

I like Bad Guys, I like the franchise.

I'm a fan.

You are so good in this movie.

You're so good.

That's very nice of you to say.

I'm all right, but I mean,

you are so cool in this movie. You're so good.

You're pretty cool yourself.

Well, you know. Thank you for saying that.

Holistically.

We didn't get to work together in this one.

Well, we have our whole Tai Chi project.

We're gonna have to do a Tai Chi rom-com.

Yes.

Bugsy Siegel meets Bugsy-

Malone. Malone.

Yes. [chuckling]

Cracked it.

[tape tearing] Sam Rockwell, Gong Show.

I love you in this movie. Chuck Barris.

[sighing] I love you in this movie.

Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.

George Clooney directed the shit outta that movie.

God, you're so good in it.

Clooney gave me a video camera.

He told me to go follow Chuck Barris around,

and I basically, practically lived

with Chuck Barris and his wife.

I've watched that movie- And Rutger Hauer

was in that movie.

I got to work with Rutger. Oh, from Blade Runner?

Hauer.

Wow. Yeah, along with

Julia Roberts and Drew Barrymore.

Oh, and she's so great.

Okay.

Sam Rockwell. [tape tearing]

Iron Man Two.

Two, yes.

Fun, fun gig.

It was like making an independent movie, actually.

Me and Mickey Rourke, we were oddly shooting it in sequence.

Mm-hmm.

So we'd be like, let's add Mickey's parrot.

He said, I want my parrot.

He always wants his parrot.

That's Mickey. He wants his

fucking parrot in the movie

so we put the goddamn parrot in the movie.

Yeah.

I heard Darren Aronofsky had to get the parrot

outta the entire Wrestler.

[Sam laughing] Shot by shot.

They spent the entire budget on it.

The fucking parrot was wrestling for fuck's sake.

Look. On steroids.

I mean, come on, the guy's good at what he does.

Jesus Christ.

But I wouldn't be in that movie

if it wasn't for Justin Theroux and Jon Favreau, yeah.

I was texting with Justin.

You know, he was on Poker Face recently.

Yeah.

I was texting with him. Oh, he was?

Yesterday, and he was talking

a lot of shit about you, Sam.

He was?

Yeah.

He was saying, what'd he say?

He said, That guy can't do splits.

Never spent not one day with Chuck Barris.

I'm gonna Tai Chi his ass.

You're gonna.

Getting him back.

Ah, flingsy wingsy.

[card thudding] [Sam chuckling]

Natasha Lyonne [tape tearing]

have Instagram?

Me have Instagram?

Big time.

On there 29 hours a day.

See me there.

Who does Natasha Lyonne [tape tearing]

play in New Girl?

I remember, Gretchen.

Next.

Okay.

Can Natasha Lyonne swim?

Why would you wanna know this?

Why would they ask? Okay, first of all,

nobody loves swimming more than me.

Why do we need to know this? Other than

Burt Lancaster in The Swimmer.

Ah, good reference. I mean, that's a movie.

Natasha Lyonne [tape tearing]

voice acting.

Well, Bad Guys 2.

And now in theaters.

[card thudding]

Bada bing, bada bang.

All right, here we go.

[tape tearing] Boom.

What is Sam Rockwell's three week rule?

I see my beloved Leslie Bibb every three weeks, hopefully.

Oh, really?

Sometimes we had to break that rule, yeah.

That's actually really smart.

Yeah. What is

Sam Rockwell's monologue? [tape tearing]

We talking about White Lotus?

It's quite a monologue.

Check it out.

Would you say that any dark, dirty stuff happens in there?

Yeah, yeah.

What does Sam Rockwell [tape tearing]

dance to in Charlie's?

Ah, well, Gotta Give It Up, Marvin Gaye, yeah.

Charlie's Angels, that's right.

Okay, well, mission accomplished there.

There you go.

[tape tearing] I see.

Angels was here

at the bottom. Good question.

I thought maybe Charlie's was a dive bar,

no offense. [Sam laughing]

What is Sam Rockwell like in-

Real life?

[chuckling] He's a real bimbo.

[card thudding] That is not true.

Sammy's one of the,

I mean, he keeps- Is a real dummy.

He keeps our community together like nobody else.

[both kissing] I love Sammy Rocks.

Wow, that's a nice thing to say.

And it's true.

I'm gonna get shy and put my sunglasses on.

Oh, and I guess I'll get shy and just-

Wow. You know, find mine.

And then- That's a

very sweet thing to say.

You keep us grounded.

Keep a mouth of work. I will take the job.

Yeah, well, you've got the job.

I'm tech avail.

Thank you. [upbeat music]

I hope you've enjoyed.

Yes, it, so much.

I'm Dr. Andrea Love, biomedical scientist,

and I'm back to fact check false health claims.

Let's answer your questions from the internet.

This is Pseudoscience Support 3.

[upbeat music]

Chamath says, Advice I gave my son,

which I need to follow more myself.

Read the ingredients when you buy food.

If you don't know what it is or can't pronounce it,

don't buy it and surely don't eat it.

Whether you can pronounce a word or not

has nothing to do with what the thing is.

I mean, it took me years to figure out

how to pronounce acai,

and that doesn't mean that it's harmful.

This is 5R-1S-1,2-dihydroxyethyl-3,4-dihydroxyfuran-25H-one.

Now, if you saw that word on a label,

you might be scared of it based on Chamath's logic,

but the colloquial word is just vitamin C.

The name of chemicals tell scientists

important information about them,

how many molecules are in them, how they're organized,

and their properties.

This logic about avoiding foods or ingredients

with chemical names you don't understand or can't pronounce

is just an example of chemophobia,

irrational fear of chemicals,

and this has been a clever marketing ploy

by many in the wellness industry

to scare people away from things

that have no potential risk to their health.

decor_throwaway wants to know,

Have you all seen the Dirty Dozen list?

What are we supposed to feed our families?

The Dirty Dozen list is an annual list

written by the Environmental Working Group or the EWG,

and they claim it is the 12 most contaminated

conventionally grown fruits and vegetables,

and they're covered in pesticides,

and you should avoid them, scaring people away

from very safe and nutritious, conventionally grown

fruits and vegetables that are half the cost

of organic options, in order to direct people

to buy organic versions of those items.

According to this year's list,

spinach is the dirtiest of the Dirty Dozen.

They fail to include the fact that the amount of spinach

you'd have to eat in order to hit the safety threshold

for pesticide levels is 145 pounds of spinach.

This is just two pounds of spinach.

What the USDA's annual pesticide residue report

actually says is that in 99% of all sampled foods,

those trace levels of pesticides

are well below the safety thresholds

for each of those different substances.

@calleymeans asks, While 40% of modern humans

will get cancer, our closest relatives, chimpanzees,

rarely get it, despite sharing nearly 99% of our genes.

Why is that?

Well, Calley, I'll help you

since you're a wellness industry lobbyist

and have no scientific or medical expertise,

chimps do get cancer.

Cancers are diseases of aging, broadly.

In humans, the median age of cancer onset is 60 years old.

As you get older, your cells get older too,

and cancer occurs because of mutations

in very specific families of genes.

There's one tumor suppressor gene called P53

that is very differently expressed

in people versus chimpanzees, and that's a big reason

why more chimpanzees don't get cancer.

But the biggest reason is that in the wild,

chimpanzees only live to be between 25 and 33 years old.

But we know that in captivity, when chimps live to 40, 50,

and beyond, they do develop cancer.

Grassfedguru48 wants to know, Genuine question,

why has Red dye 40 not been banned?

Literally everyone knows it's bad for you.

Why are we willfully allowing poison in our food?

Red 40 is a coloring that's used in a variety

of food, drinks, and medicines,

including some gummy candies, medicines.

They're colored so that people don't misdose them,

as well as meal replacement shakes.

Colorings are really important for people's perception

of foods and flavors,

particularly those with sensory issues.

And if you look at the acceptable daily intake

of something like Red 40, in the U.S.,

it's seven milligrams per kilogram per day,

which is the same as it is in Japan,

the same as it is in Europe, the same as it is in Canada,

and the same as it is in Australia.

And there's no way that you would be eating

an excess in your daily diet,

even if you only ate red-colored gummy candy

for your entire daily intake.

We're not just gonna remove colorings.

They're going to be replaced with other colorings,

naturally derived chemicals.

For example, one of which is cochineal,

which is a red coloring that is extracted

from scale insects.

So it's very ecologically damaging

because these insects live on certain cacti species,

and they're harvested by farm workers.

They have high rates of allergenicity.

We don't have that with Red 40.

And on top of that, vegans and people that adhere

to Muslim or kosher dietary habits cannot eat foods

that are colored using insect-derived coloring.

So you're not actually solving a problem.

In many ways, you're making a worse problem.

East-Illustrator-225 wants to know, What does MAHA mean?

MAHA is the acronym for RFK Jr.'s former slogan

of his failed presidential campaign.

It stands for Make America Healthy Again.

The problem is that the whole MAHA platform

and the movement are actually in direct opposition

to what would make us healthier.

We could be expanding healthcare access,

but instead we're actually removing that

from the most vulnerable people

with cuts to Medicaid and Medicare.

And with unfounded accusations about the harms of vaccines,

we're seeing resurgence

in many of these preventable diseases.

They're also trying to cut funding for SNAP,

which provides food access and financial support

for lower-income families.

So if we really want to address

some of these chronic illnesses that are the leading causes

of death in the U.S., we might want to continue to develop

novel and innovative cancer screenings and treatments.

Unfortunately, this current administration

just gutted funding for cancer research,

which is certainly going to have the opposite effect.

RobynInWellness says, High-dose vitamin C

is lethal to cancer while leaving healthy cells unscathed.

Cancer cells can't survive it. They implode from within.

Yeah, none of this is true.

Just like with most pseudoscience claims,

that nugget of truth that vitamin C is incredibly important

at a small level has been wildly exaggerated.

Now, vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin,

so if you overdose on it, it will be excreted in your urine.

The claims that relate to megadosing

or intravenous doses of vitamin C and killing cancer cells

are all based on Petri dish studies

where they're growing cancer cells on a piece of plastic

and they're blasting them with vitamin C.

But you can kill cells on a piece of plastic with anything.

If you pour pure water on cells

in a Petri dish, they'll explode.

Unfortunately, people who believe this information

often will then forego proven cancer treatments

before the cancer progresses to a later stage.

loshed says, I just spent the past hour

reading about why fluoride is bad and freaking out.

Freaking out. Tin-hatting like a mother.

They're killing us!

Good news is, they're not killing us.

Fluoride is everywhere. It's ubiquitous in nature.

Decades ago, some dentists noticed that in areas

where people had discolored teeth,

they had extremely low rates of cavities.

It was because of naturally high levels

of fluoride in their water.

We fluorinate water at a very, very small level,

0.7 parts per million.

So to put that in context,

a gallon of water is about 3.78 kilograms.

We would be adding about 2.6 microliters

of fluoride solution, 1/20 of a drop of water.

If you tried to drink enough water

where you might experience fluoride toxicity,

you would have to be drinking 357 liters of water

or 94 gallons in a day.

You would die from water toxicity

way before you would experience

adverse effects from the fluoride.

Fluoridated water has over 75 years of data

to show that it prevents cavities

and improves dental health.

The studies that are cited to suggest that fluoride

lowers IQ or can cause neurodevelopmental issues,

they're not correcting for other variables

that can impact the outcome, such as high levels of arsenic

or asbestos in the environment within those communities.

Those exposures can credibly cause

some of those issues that they're observing.

LotsName wants to know,

So we should stop giving kids milk at school

because of the hormones that are in milk, right?

No. You don't need to fear milk because of hormones.

The current body of evidence suggests that among children

who enter puberty earlier than normal,

it's often linked to obesity or excess adiposity.

It has nothing to do with hormones in milk.

Milk generally always contains hormones because cows,

just like humans and other animals, produce hormones.

Sometimes you might see on the label,

no RBST added to the milk.

This is referring to bovine somatotropin,

a hormone that's already naturally produced by cows.

Dairy cows, sometimes they're given

additional amounts of bovine somatotropin

because it can increase milk production.

Bovine is the key word there.

This is a cow-specific hormone.

It has no biological effect on people,

even if you were to deliberately consume it.

Claims about all sorts of other growth hormones

or sex hormones is just patently false.

Even if there were a biological effect,

if you pasteurize your milk, which you all should be,

it's not gonna have any biological impact.

@driptechh says, I developed EDS and POTS

within the year that I got the vaccine,

and my heart health has been in steady rapid decline.

I really urge anyone who thinks mRNA is safe

to really think about why you think restructuring DNA

is any way safe or healthy.

mRNA, particularly mRNA in COVID vaccines,

is not restructuring DNA.

In reality, every single one of your cells

is producing mRNA at all times

because that's how you make proteins.

In order to do that, DNA is converted

through a process called transcription into RNA.

And that RNA leaves the nucleus,

that's a one-directional process,

then it hooks up with a protein complex called the ribosome

where it's converted into an amino acid sequence

that then folds into a protein.

So in the case of the mRNA vaccine,

that vaccine contains the mRNA sequence,

in the case of COVID vaccines, for the spike protein.

That RNA hooks up with the ribosomes,

and our cells create that spike protein,

which then our immune system mounts a defense against.

So nothing ever enters or approaches the nucleus

where our DNA is located to even change the DNA.

People who still believe that the mRNA vaccines

can change DNA often cite this paper from 2022.

They look at the ability of an enzyme called LINE-1,

instead of going DNA to RNA, it converts RNA to DNA.

And they say that the mRNA in the COVID vaccine

is being converted into DNA.

They never show that any of that mRNA

ever interacts with cellular DNA.

But beyond that, they're using a liver cell line,

meaning these are cells growing on a piece of plastic,

and these are cancerous,

meaning they are not behaving normally,

and they express this reverse transcriptase enzyme,

whereas our healthy cells do not.

So this model isn't biologically plausible

in the way that these vaccines work in our bodies.

No other studies have shown anything similar,

and we have orders of magnitude, higher data points

with actual human clinical data to show that mRNA vaccines

are not changing our DNA, and they're safe,

and they save millions of lives.

Ivan Loans asks,

Why do we have so many kids with diabetes?

We actually have very low rates

of diabetes amongst children.

Only 0.35% of people under the age of 20

have diagnosed diabetes.

86.6% of those are type 1 diabetes,

which is an autoimmune disorder where the pancreatic

insulin-producing cells are destroyed.

0.046% of people under the age of 20 have type 2 diabetes.

That's not a lot of children with diabetes.

azurricat2010 asks, RFK Jr. removes all members

of CDC panel advising U.S. on vaccines.

How is this beneficial to America?

It's not.

The Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices, or ACIP,

previously consisted of 17 members,

all of whom were vetted very thoroughly before appointment.

And they are an outside, impartial committee

that reviews FDA and CDC data.

Only ACIP-recommended vaccines have to legally be covered

by your health insurance.

Well, what RFK Jr. did was he removed all 17 members

of the previous ACIP, and he replaced them

with eight people of his own choosing.

And these include people like Robert Malone,

who you probably heard of during the COVID pandemic.

But since then, he's also said that people were hypnotized

by mass-formation psychosis,

that COVID vaccines killed 17 million people.

Just to be clear, all of those things

that Robert Malone has said are objectively false,

and he is now one of the members of CDC's ACIP panel.

Another one would be Martin Kulldorff.

He was the co-author along, with Jay Bhattacharya,

our head of NIH, of the Great Barrington Declaration,

an opinion piece that basically said

we should just let COVID run rampant.

You also have Retsef Levi,

who has a PhD in operations management.

It has nothing to do with vaccine science,

regulatory expertise, and he has repeatedly said

that mRNA vaccines cause serious harm, including death,

especially among young people.

So when you have these individuals

on what should be our leading advisory panel,

you can understand why that's not going

to improve the health of Americans.

WhenYoureStraaange asks, How can I avoid

falling into the traps of pseudoscience?

It can be really hard to discern pseudoscience,

which maybe looks like science

or uses science-sounding language,

but does not have evidence to support it.

Watch for buzzwords instead of evidence.

So if you see claims about gut-healing,

immune-boosting, brain health,

usually those are gonna be followed by products or claims

that don't have clinical evidence to support them.

Check your source, but then also check your source's source.

PubMed is often used because it's a repository

of peer-reviewed papers.

But it's not a fact checker.

It's basically like a library

that's storing all these papers,

and it doesn't automatically score them

for whether they're reliable,

whether they've been reproduced.

The best way to be able to discern what's real

and what's not is to go to a trusted expert in that field.

Because scientists and scientific experts are trained

to pick apart these studies and understand whether

what they're saying is actually supported by their data.

There's never going to be a situation

in which a single paper is going to disrupt

everything we know about a given scientific topic.

And if that were the case, it would not be circulated

by a popular press article.

It would be something that would be

taking the scientific field by storm.

Wasteofspace778 wants to know,

What is the obsession with glucose spikes?

The wellness industry have created this notion

that non-diabetics should be tracking, monitoring,

and trying to manipulate their blood glucose levels

by wearing what's called a continuous glucose monitor.

It tracks blood glucose levels after you eat,

before you eat, and so on and so forth.

Doing this is not going to offer you

any sort of health benefits

if you don't have type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Non-diabetic people typically have blood glucose levels

that range between 80 and 140 grams per deciliter of blood.

Throughout any given day,

you're gonna have fluctuations within that range.

You don't actually have to monitor it

'cause your pancreas is already doing it.

Casey Means, for example, founded the company Levels

where she sells a continuous glucose monitor

and a list of supplements and a recipe book,

and it costs several hundred dollars a month

to kind of stay on the subscription plan

that she claims is going to improve your overall health.

The Glucose Goddess recently launched a supplement

that she calls Anti-Spike.

There have been studies where they tracked non-diabetics

wearing continuous blood glucose monitors.

In 99% of the cases, the blood glucose levels

were always within that normal excursion range.

There has been no clinical data that suggests

that wearing this or trying to reduce the number

or range of these blood glucose excursions

is offering any sort of health benefit.

It's not preventing the development of diabetes.

@RobertKennedyJc, a commentary account, says,

When JFK was in the White House, America was strong,

healthy, and full of energy,

free from today's epidemic of chronic disease.

Since then, illness has skyrocketed, draining our vitality.

Let's make America healthy again.

JFK was in the White House in the early 1960s.

Since then, we've actually improved health in a lot of ways.

See these really thick bars,

the most predominant causes of death in the early 1900s?

These were infectious diseases.

Tuberculosis, pneumonia caused by bacterial infections

and influenza, respiratory viruses, and viral diseases,

and gastrointestinal infections.

These are all gone from our causes of death

in the U.S. today, and that's because of vaccines,

sanitation, water treatment, antibiotics,

the ability to do surgeries

in aseptic environments, blood transfusions.

Today, we deal with mostly diseases associated with aging.

Heart disease, things like atherosclerosis,

heart blockage, cancers,

and cancers are hundreds of different diseases

with a median age of onset of 60 years old.

So when we were dying in our 40s, in our 50s,

we were not living long enough for cancers to even develop.

And then we're also dealing with accidents

as a leading cause of death.

When were we healthy in these people's estimation?

When life expectancy of humans was 47,

31% of those deaths were in children under five.

Well, that was what it was like in the 1900s.

Penicillin, the very first antibiotic,

was not available until 1945.

So it might be really appealing to romanticize

back in the day, but the reality is we're living longer,

healthier, more vital lives today than we were

when JFK was in the White House.

@u_dnt_get_it_85 wants to know,

What's your take on germ theory denialism?

Germ theory denialism is the false belief

that diseases are not caused by viruses,

bacteria, fungi, and so on.

This belief started in the 1800s

by a gentleman named Antoine Bechamp,

a counterpart to Louis Pasteur, the founder of germ theory.

And Antoine Bechamp believed in something

called terrain theory, in that your environment

and your overall physiology determined

whether you would become sick or not.

If you're healthy, you won't get measles.

Or if you were taking the right supplements,

you won't develop cancer.

But unfortunately, our bodies are a lot more complicated

than that, and we know these microorganisms

that cause many of these infectious diseases,

and because we know them, we can either treat them

or we can prevent them through vaccination.

And so the fact that there are still people

that promote this, people like Joe Rogan and Bill Maher

and RFK Jr. and many of their allies,

just goes to show that there's no amount of scientific data

that's going to get people to concede that their beliefs

and their strongly held opinions are wrong

because we've been collecting this data

for over 200 years now.

SunflowerSeedsO wants to know, Are IV lounges,

drip bars, therapies a scam?

Yes.

Just like all dietary supplements,

IV dietary supplements are also unregulated,

meaning they do not have to have evidence

of efficacy or even safety.

IV bags can contain some vitamins that you maybe need,

but they also can contain a lot of things

that you may not even know.

You're now allowing an untrained person

in a med spa to put an IV line directly into your vein,

which opens the door for opportunistic infections.

While many people report feeling better

after receiving an IV drip at one of these bars,

usually it's because they're getting hydration,

not because this mystery cocktail of supplements

is offering any sort of health benefits.

Eat a healthy diet, eat your fruits and vegetables,

and if you're feeling dehydrated,

maybe drink some Pedialyte instead.

mirawaaa wants to know, How to convince your family

that these vaccines are safe?

Please help.

The risk of getting into an accident in your car

are actually orders of magnitude higher

than the risk of an adverse event from a vaccine.

Mild adverse events are what we call reactogenicity.

Those are signs that your immune system

is doing what it's supposed to do.

Swollen lymph nodes near the vaccination site,

a low-grade fever, some fatigue, sore arm.

Serious adverse events happen very rarely,

less than one time out of every 100,000 doses of a vaccine.

And very serious adverse events,

like an anaphylactic allergic reaction,

happen around one in 1 million doses of a vaccine.

So these risks are incredibly rare.

Before the smallpox vaccine was developed,

we had over 110,000 cases of smallpox every year in the U.S.

Smallpox had about a 30% mortality rate.

Solely because of the smallpox vaccine,

we have eradicated smallpox from human existence.

Pertussis caused about 175,000 cases

of whooping cough every year.

Now, because of the vaccine, we've reduced it by 89%.

Measles used to cause millions of deaths globally

every single year before the measles vaccine,

but the vaccine globally has reduced measles by 99%.

Unfortunately, because of refusal to vaccinate,

we're now seeing reemergence of measles.

godless_mom wants to know, Acupuncture.

We've had a discussion in our parenting group on Facebook.

Some say it worked for them,

others arguing from the side of science.

What do you think?

When you look at robust randomized and blinded

clinical studies, the effect most people are reporting

is more placebo than therapeutic benefit.

Now, it's important to note that acupuncture

is a multi-billion dollar industry,

and while insurance companies often do cover

acupuncture treatments, it's not inherently

because there's science to support it.

It's because there's a market for this practice.

There's no strong evidence that acupuncture

is going to offer something

that science-based physical therapy

or musculoskeletal rehab is going to offer you.

But people often report a benefit

because they want to feel a benefit.

BurtRigg asks, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says beef tallow

is healthier than seed oils.

Is he right? No, he's wrong.

Like he is about most things.

Beef tallow is a type of rendered fat derived from cows,

and it is high in saturated fatty acids

like myristic and palmitic acid.

We actually have decades of robust evidence

that show that a diet high in polyunsaturated fats,

like those in seed oils, compared to a diet

high in saturated fats, like those found in beef tallow,

reduce your risk of heart disease, atherosclerosis,

high levels of LDL cholesterol, that's the bad one,

and triglycerides, and actually promote heart health.

A lot of people have been misled to believe

that the process of extracting oils from seeds is harmful

or it's leading to toxic substances in the seed oils.

And that's just objectively false.

These oils are purified, and any sort of materials

that are used for the extraction

are not present in the seed oil.

And finally, some people claim that seed oils

are inflammatory because when they're heated

at really high temperatures,

they generate these harmful byproducts.

These seed oils would have to be heated

to well above 400 degrees Fahrenheit for any of these

potentially harmful byproducts to be generated.

And that's not going to be happening

if you're cooking with them or using them in your foods

on a day-to-day basis.

Some people promote the use of beef tallow for skincare,

and this all hearkens back to this appeal to ancestry,

because the ancestors used beef tallow,

a false belief that natural chemicals are better.

And so beef tallow, it's a natural fat,

it must be good for your face.

But science has given us knowledge

of all of these different molecules

that help to hydrate your face,

reduce aging signs, things like sun damage.

Beef tallow is not gonna replace that.

UwStudent98210 asks, Anybody heard of chlorine dioxide?

Yeah, so chlorine dioxide is the same thing

as Miracle Mineral Solution.

This was promoted by a guy named Jim Humble,

who was a Scientologist, and he wrote a book

in the early 2000s called, The Miracle Mineral Solution,

where he essentially told parents

that they should feed their children

this chemical chlorine dioxide.

Now, chlorine dioxide colloquially

is known as industrial bleach.

Even at a relatively low dose,

it can cause severe complications and health issues,

including nausea, vomiting, kidney failure.

It can also interfere with their ability

to transport oxygen,

and it can also cause severe GI distress.

If you inhale it, it can cause pulmonary edema

or fluid filling in your lungs.

However, you have wellness influencers

who tout it as a cure-all for autism, HIV, cancer.

All of our scientific and regulatory agencies

explicitly warn against the use of chlorine dioxide

for any therapeutic use.

The problem is, is because this falls into this loophole

of wellness products, people are still able

to find chlorine dioxide,

whether through industrial chemical supply

or through wellness companies,

and they're using it to cause harm

to themselves or to other people.

ric4100 asks, Why are we injecting newborns

with a vaccine for a disease they can't catch?

So this is referring to the hepatitis B vaccine,

which is given to newborns.

And Ric, they can catch hepatitis B.

Contrary to the claims of anti-vaccine activists

and our recent surgeon general nominee, Casey Means,

hepatitis B is not just a sexually transmitted infection.

The hepatitis B virus is spread to children perinatally,

so during the process of birth,

or through direct contact with any bodily fluids,

usually from a close family member.

Hepatitis B infection in childhood

leads to chronic hepatitis in 90% of the cases.

And chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B

is the cause of 60% of all liver cancers.

So you would think that knowing that we could prevent

90% of chronic hepatitis cases in kids

and all the subsequent liver cancers that would result,

we would be shouting from the rooftops, This is great,

we're preventing chronic illness, right?

Wrong.

Unfortunately, because this has become this battle cry

of anti-vaxxers that we're harming all these newborns

by giving them this vaccine.

But we didn't always vaccinate against hepatitis B at birth.

In the 1980s, we had thousands and thousands

of hepatitis B infections every year.

But in 1991, the U.S. adopted

a universal newborn vaccine recommendation,

and since then, we have reduced the prevalence

of chronic hepatitis B to less than 0.1%

among kids under five.

Acute hepatitis B infections themselves has declined by 82%,

and it is incredibly safe and effective.

nzt48nootropics wants to know,

Why does everyone swear by lion's mane?

Lion's mane is touted in the wellness spheres

as a cognitive performance enhancer,

that it's going to improve focus,

it's gonna improve brain function.

The problem is, all the evidence to suggest

those sorts of things have been done in mice

or in cells growing on a piece of plastic.

There's no actual evidence in humans

that lion's mane supplements are actually offering

those sorts of cognitive or brain health benefits.

You'll often find lion's mane mixed in a cocktail

along with instant coffee.

And so they'll say that the lion's mane

is boosting your focus, but they ignore the fact

that coffee, which has caffeine,

actually improves your focus.

Now, lion's mane is an edible mushroom,

and mushrooms are a great part of a healthy diet.

But don't be misled to believe that it's a miracle panacea

that's gonna somehow reverse normal aging of your brain

or improve your cognitive function,

because the data just aren't there.

brand_air asks, Is it really that bad to eat at night?

Food is food, right? And besides, it's daytime somewhere.

I mean, the earth is forever rotating,

so late night eating could be daytime at any time.

Our bodies function on a circadian rhythm,

meaning we have these 24-hour sleep-wake cycles.

During the day and through the night,

you have different levels of certain hormones

and signaling molecules that can alter

or change processes that are occurring in your body.

In the evening, people generally have a little bit

reduced insulin sensitivity, meaning if you ate

the same exact thing at night that you did

maybe first thing in the morning,

your normal blood glucose excursion

might be slightly higher, but still normal.

It's not gonna be super impactful.

The reason that some people experience weight gain

or issues with eating late at night

is because the quality of the food they're eating

is generally calorie-dense, not nutrient-dense.

So they're eating an excess number of calories

beyond what they should be eating

for their overall metabolic rate.

So those are all the questions for today.

Remember, always verify your sources.

Take every piece of information you come across

with a grain of salt.

Sensational claims always get more attention

than the more nuanced reality.

I'm Alex Wellerstein.

I'm a nuclear historian.

I'm here today to answer your questions from the internet.

This is Nuclear History Support.

[upbeat music]

All right, first up, we have one from @AmericanVsGov.

What countries have nukes?

There are nine countries today in the world

with nuclear weapons that we know about.

The United States, first country that got them.

The Soviet Union got them in 1949.

Today, those nuclear weapons are in the hands

of the Russian Federation.

The United Kingdom, People's Republic of China, France.

These are the five officially allowed countries

under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty

to have nuclear weapons.

There is also Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea,

so nine countries total.

There were a few countries that inherited nuclear weapons

after the fall of the Soviet Union,

Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan,

but they returned all of those weapons

to Russia in an agreement.

LJWhitman1, asks, Who decides which countries

can have nukes and which countries can't?

What are their criteria?

The decision about who can quote, unquote, have nukes

and who quote, unquote, can't,

this is the result of a treaty,

the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,

which was created in 1968

to try and slow the spread of nuclear weapons.

If you sign the treaty, you agree that only five countries,

the countries that had tested nuclear weapons by 1967,

are allowed to have nuclear weapons.

Anybody else is not allowed under that treaty.

So if you sign that treaty,

you agree those are the only five that have nuclear weapons

and nobody else should have.

Pakistan, India, and Israel never signed the treaty,

have developed their own nuclear weapons.

There's also North Korea, which was a member of the treaty,

but then left the treaty and made nuclear weapons.

Is it illegal for them to have nuclear weapons?

Only in the sense that they're not members of the treaty.

What the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty does

is it allows any country without nuclear weapons

to know that anybody else who signed the treaty

is probably not also trying to get nuclear weapons.

So if you're worried that your rival across the way

might be getting nukes,

if you and they both signed the treaty,

then you're not going to have to worry as much

about them getting the weapons.

It also gives them access

to peaceful nuclear technology like nuclear reactors.

It means that they have the right

to work on that kind of stuff

without worrying that somebody's gonna try

and, you know, blow up their reactor

out of fear that it's a nuclear bomb.

zipthwung asks, Was Iran building a bomb?

If so, how close to a bomb was Iran?

How were the nuclear talks going

before Israel preemptively attacked?

Great question. Was Iran building a nuclear weapon?

No, I don't think anybody thinks Iran

was actively building a nuclear weapon.

The accusation, made particularly by Israel,

is that Iran was setting up the conditions

under which it could build a nuclear weapon

very quickly if it wanted to.

Iran did have a nuclear weapons program before 2003,

and the Iran deal was them essentially saying,

We're gonna close down

and disable all the little things we were doing

that were bad and we won't do them anymore.

Once the United States left the Iran deal,

Iran has been creeping up beyond the limits of the deal.

You know, depending on what your stance is,

you either think that's because

they are trying to get ready to make a bomb,

or because they're trying to compel the United States

to come back to the negotiation table as a way of saying,

Look, if you leave this deal, which we did,

we can do this now,

and if you want us to stop, come back to the deal.

Now, how are the nuclear talks going?

I don't think that great.

I don't think it's clear exactly what Iran wants, per se.

They're sort of leaving the door open for different options,

which would make a lot of sense

given the recent history that they've had

with the United States and with Israel,

but they were not, you know, racing to make a bomb.

hellherekitten asks, WTF is a nuclear football?

It's basically a suitcase.

What the nuclear football is meant to do

is allow the president of the United States

to order a nuclear strike

even if they are not in the White House or the Pentagon.

If the president is visiting some other country

or some other city, they have basically

a very burly, usually, military person

carrying a very heavy suitcase around.

And in that suitcase,

there are information about nuclear war plans.

There are some communication tools probably

to allow the president

to easily link up with top generals and advisors

and whatever is needed

to authenticate the president's nuclear war order

if the president decides to make that.

Sophikkelson asks, Once in a while,

I think about how many nukes the US has lost.

How tf do you lose a nuke?

Find them now.

There are a number of quote, unquote, lost nuclear weapons,

and what that really means is there is a nuclear weapon

that was on say, an airplane or a submarine,

and that airplane either crashed or the submarine sunk,

and the weapon is now in the environment, in the world.

These kinds of accidents

were not super uncommon during the Cold War.

The United States had a program in the 1950s and 1960s

to basically have airplanes with nuclear weapons

flying in the air 24 hours a day, seven days a week,

so that if nuclear war started,

they could have some kind of guarantee

that they'd have a plane ready to retaliate no matter what.

Same thing with submarines.

They still go around

with nuclear weapons on them all the time.

If you have thousands of airplanes

flying tens of thousands of flight hours,

you're gonna have an accident every once in a while.

Some of these accidents have resulted

in like the weapon either itself falling out of the plane,

or in the case of a submarine,

just going down to the bottom of the ocean.

Any kind of mishap you can imagine,

a lot of them have happened.

In most cases, of course, the United States

is very interested in recovering those weapons,

both because it's, you know, not a good look

to have lost nuclear weapons,

but also they contain the fuel you might need

to make more nuclear weapons

and you don't want that falling in the wrong hands.

And so the US always tried to recover these things,

but sometimes the warhead sunk so deep underground

that after weeks of trying to dig it out,

they couldn't get it or it's at the bottom of the ocean

and they couldn't find it.

They're lost in the sense that the US can't recover them,

not that they don't know, more or less, where they are,

and they're lost in the sense

that the US couldn't recover them

and thinks nobody else could either,

and decided to sort of cut their losses

and, you know, maybe they put a monument that says,

Don't dig here.

But they concluded

that if the army couldn't dig this thing up,

nobody else could either.

Matilda_Mother_67 asks,

Why did the United States bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki

instead of some military headquarters

or other places where civilians weren't?

There were a lot of processes and meetings

and decisions made along the way

about what this bomb was, how it should work,

what it would be used against.

At the beginning of making the bomb, like say 1943,

the attitude was, We'll probably use this

against some sort of military installation.

The first target they even discussed

was basically the Japanese equivalent of Pearl Harbor,

it's called Truk.

And sure, there would be some civilians there,

but it's not dropping it in the middle of a city.

By 1945, 2 years later,

one, Truk is not an issue militarily anymore.

They had cut it off. It was not a target.

And two, the United States had gotten in the habit

of targeting cities.

In the early part of 1945, the United States

began firebombing Japanese cities with napalm.

They burnt Tokyo, they burnt Osaka.

They ended up burning 67 Japanese cities

by dropping basically flaming gasoline on them.

The other issue is that the bomb they ended up with

was one that would work best

if you detonated it pretty high in the air.

If you detonate it high in the air,

you spread the blast damage out wider,

but your blast damage is also less intense.

So if your target is some built-up bunker,

you're not gonna destroy it

by blowing up the bomb in the air.

If your target is a house,

you don't need as much blast pressure to destroy it.

So they had a bomb that they ended up with,

through technical decisions along the way,

that would be most impressive if you used it on a city.

And they had many discussions about what kind of target,

what's the goal of this weapon.

The goal of the weapon was essentially psychological.

They wanted to cause the Japanese people

to say, We cannot tolerate this.

We cannot win. Let's surrender.

One of the people involved in the discussion

said that the goal was to have the Japanese

basically capitulate to the power of the universe.

Oh, you don't wanna surrender to the United States

or the Soviet Union?

Well what if we use the power of the sun to destroy you?

To me, the really interesting thing is that Hiroshima

was not their first choice at all for a target.

The first choice that the military had was Kyoto,

former capital of Japan.

It was taken off the list by the Secretary of War,

Henry Stimson, because he thought

that the city was too civilian in nature,

was a cultural heritage site.

Hiroshima got then bumped up to first place

because it had some military bases

and manufacturing in it.

It had not yet been bombed.

Its geography was such that it was

sort of like a bowl-shaped city surrounded by hills,

and that meant it would kind of intensify

the effect of the weapon.

So from the point of view of the United States military

and the scientists who consulted from them,

it was a perfectly good target.

Nagasaki was only added to the target list

after Kyoto was taken off of it

because they wanted a backup target.

The actual target for the second bombing run

was a different city, Kokura.

Kokura had a major arsenal in the center of it

that produced weapons for the Japanese

and was surrounded by workers' houses.

So by their criteria, this was a great target.

When they got to Kokura though,

they found that it was covered by smoke or clouds or haze.

It's not clear exactly what.

But they could not see it to exactly target the bomb on it.

So they went to the backup target,

which was Nagasaki, which was nearby.

matthewswaite asks, I can't help

but think gun control debates

mirror that of nuclear weapons proliferation.

Does every country having nukes make us all safer?

This is a classic question.

Is the world safer if there are only

a couple countries with nuclear weapons

or would it be safer if all the countries

had nuclear weapons?

If there were a lot of countries with nuclear weapons,

presumably they would be very hesitant

to go to war with one another

because the consequences would be terrible.

On the other hand, if you think that the chances

of either accidental nuclear war

or people thinking nuclear war was winnable,

or terrorism, if you think the chances

of those are relatively high,

then more nuclear weapons in the world

is a much more dangerous world

because that's a world in which nuclear war

is more likely to occur.

It's not clear what the answer is here.

Generally speaking, I'm more swayed by the arguments

that is a little bit dangerous

to have lots of countries with nuclear weapons in the world.

I know that's a really hot take,

but I don't trust the systems

or governments of these countries to be sort of perfect

with regard to they're not starting a nuclear war.

And if you don't think that they're going to be perfect,

then it becomes very dangerous over time,

the more people who have nuclear weapons.

Huge_Bag69 asks, Enriched uranium, what is it?

What is the process of enriching?

How dangerous is it on its own?

So uranium is an element.

You can mine it out of the ground.

It's a rock.

You can even get it out of sea water.

It's relatively abundant.

By itself, if we went out and got a rock of uranium,

the uranium we would find

would have two types of uranium inside of it.

One of 'em would be called uranium-238.

There would be 99% of that

in any uranium we pulled out of the ground.

And less than 1% of it,

it's like 0.7% would be uranium-235.

So these are two of the same element,

but they differ in that uranium-238 has three more neutrons

inside of it than uranium-235.

So we call these different isotopes.

Uranium-238 will not explode in a bomb.

Uranium-235 will.

So enrichment is when we take this uranium

and pull out the uranium-235,

almost literally atom by atom.

This is a very difficult process to do

because the difference between these

is only three neutrons, which is not very much.

They are chemically identical.

So we have to rely on the fact

that one's a little bit lighter than the other.

So uranium enrichment,

there's different processes for doing it.

And the most famous right now is the centrifuge

where we basically are spinning

around uranium in a gaseous form,

and as we spin it,

the centrifugal forces will cause the lighter uranium

to move slightly and more one direction

and the heavier slightly another,

and we skim off the part that would have the lighter.

And we have to run it through another centrifuge

to skim off a little more

and then another to skim off a little more.

And so we're taking advantage

of little tiny statistical differences

in how heavy they are.

And we do this for thousands of centrifuges

and you will eventually end up

with more and more uranium-235.

When we want uranium for fuel in a nuclear power plant,

we tend to enrich it up to about 3% uranium-235.

When we want it for a bomb,

we want it to be much higher than that.

The bomb dropped on Hiroshima

was about 80% uranium-235.

In the United States now, the standard amount in a weapon,

if we use enriched uranium, is around 93% enriched uranium.

The4thResident asks, Wait, but Einstein

was not a part of the Manhattan Project,

so how or why did they get his help during it?

Einstein's role in the atomic bomb

was at the very beginning.

He wrote a letter to President Roosevelt saying,

Hey, we have learned how to split atoms.

Germany might be working on this.

Maybe somebody in the United States government

should be looking at this.

And that's more or less

his role in the whole Manhattan Project.

Why didn't they use him?

They actually did consider using him

and they concluded two things.

One, Einstein at this point is pretty old.

He's not your cutting-edge scientist.

The kind of science he does

is not actually that useful for making an atomic bomb.

Yes, yes, =mc2 sort of explains, in a way,

where the energy comes from an atomic bomb.

It does not tell you how to make one.

It doesn't tell you how to make a factory

and design the things and the parts.

You don't need somebody like Einstein to do that.

The other thing is that Einstein

was considered politically radical.

He supported really out-there ideas like civil rights.

And that, at that time, meant that he was considered

to be politically questionable

by some people in the US government.

And so if he is the kind of person who,

to be fair, might have strong ideas

about how atomic bombs ought to be used

and has a lot of fame

and is the kind of person that presidents would listen to,

maybe you don't want him to be in the project

if your goal is to just sort of get the thing done.

CoastalBuckeye asks,

Is there still a radiation field in Hiroshima or Nagasaki?

Great question.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki had atomic bombs dropped on them

in World War II.

Here's Hiroshima. This is not far from ground zero.

You can see this building, the very famous Atomic Bomb Dome,

ground zero is very close to that.

These weapons were detonated very high above the city.

If you look at pictures of these bombs,

this is a mockup of the kind of bomb dropped in Hiroshima.

This is one for Nagasaki.

You can see they've got this equipment on them,

weird little wires.

These are fuses that detect

how high above the ground the bomb is,

and they were set to detonate at the height

that the scientists had calculated

would maximize the blast effect of the weapon.

You can think of the blast

as going sort of as a sphere out from the explosion.

And if it's really close to the ground,

a lot of that is gonna be going sort of sideways

and it's gonna be running into buildings

and they're gonna be absorbing the energy

and also reducing it as a consequence.

If you detonate it in the air,

you're sort of going down with the blast force

and it's gonna be much wider area.

So it was detonated high in the air.

The consequence of that is the people

at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

they got a blast of immediate radiation.

It's like almost like a light switch turning on and off.

You wouldn't be able to see it,

but imagine it's just like a quick exposure,

almost like X-rays or something like that.

And that was very bad for the people

who were in the range at which that would occur.

But it's a short immediate effect.

It's sort of almost like a one-time exposure.

The thing that makes nuclear weapons so contaminating

is the nuclear fallout.

These are the split atoms from the weapon

and these are in the mushroom cloud.

And one interesting thing

you can actually see in some of these pictures,

so this is a picture of Nagasaki's mushroom cloud

taken from someone on the one of the airplanes

that was involved in the bombing of Nagasaki.

And if you look closely,

you can see the cloud is actually two different parts.

You have this top part, the head,

and then you have this dark stem underneath it,

and you can actually see that they don't connect.

This is an artifact of the weapon being detonated higher up.

This cloud contains

the most radioactive residues from the bomb.

This is mostly created by fire and debris

and dust that is being pulled up

by the negative pressure of this cloud moving upwards.

And it is not that radioactive.

Now, if this bomb had been detonated on the ground,

these two parts would be mixed together.

And if that happens,

then the radioactive bits attach themselves to the dirt

and then fall out of the cloud relatively quickly

because the dirt is pretty heavy, relatively speaking.

If it doesn't happen, this part stays relatively light

and it'll blow on with the wind

and as it blows, it'll take a while

for it to start to fall out of the cloud.

And what that gets you is two things.

One, the most radioactive stuff with short half lives,

they get to sort of burn out before they fall down.

But this cloud, because it has time to spread,

it means that it's diluting.

So more area gets some radioactive bits,

but they get less like per square meter, per square foot.

So the amount of radiation is diffused in a way

that doesn't actually make it a contamination hazard.

So the long and short of it

is because they're detonated at high altitude,

they did not really get a lot of nuclear fallout.

Today, they are not radioactive in any significant way.

If the bombs had been detonated on the ground,

it would be a different story.

xjsscx on Reddit asks, What actually happens

to someone in an atomic bomb explosion?

The first thing, if you saw a nuclear weapon go off,

one, the brightness of it, it's very bright.

With that brightness comes this flash of radiation.

So if you are close enough to an atomic bomb,

you will instantly get a lot of radioactive particles,

gamma rays, beta particles, things like this

going through your body.

For the Hiroshima bomb,

the radius from the detonation point

where you get a fatal amount of radiation

is about three quarters of a mile.

If you're in that zone, you're probably dead

no matter what happens next.

If you're a little out of that zone,

you might get some radiation.

That is probably not your biggest concern

for most nuclear weapons, but it's not the best, right?

The next thing that you would experience is heat.

The surface of the fireball is hotter than the sun.

Briefly.

If you're in direct line of sight with this,

it's sort of like if the sun

was suddenly a lot closer to you than it is right now.

If you're really close to the fireball,

you could be literally vaporized as people say.

Most of the people at Hiroshima Nagasaki are not vaporized

or melted or anything, but they were severely burned.

You can get really bad burns.

The next effect,

that fireball in that first split second of it going off,

is sort of super-heating the air around it.

And what's gonna happen then

is it's going to be moving outward.

This is the shock wave, the blast wave.

And as it goes out, it's this sort of wave of pressure

that's going to intersect with the ground

and move along it and push,

and the more it goes, the weaker it goes.

But this is powerful enough at different distances

to do a lot of damage.

So at Hiroshima,

if you were about 300 meters from ground zero,

that would be enough blast pressure,

about 20 pounds per square inch,

to destroy almost any building that is standing.

Any buildings that are still remaining at Hiroshima,

like the famous Atomic Bomb Dome, are gutted.

Like nobody's doing well who was inside this building.

They're all dead.

If you go out a little further,

if you were about 1.7 kilometers

from ground zero at Hiroshima,

that's the radius at which there's enough

to definitely destroy light structures.

So houses, things like that.

You go out further to maybe about 2.8 miles,

and now the blast wave is weak enough

that the most it's doing is sort of breaking windows.

That's still not great.

If you're standing at a window as this thing comes to you,

it's gonna break all the glass and push it into you,

and now you've been injured by a window.

So depending on where you are,

there's different effects that can happen.

Stranfort asks on Reddit,

For how long do I stay in a fallout shelter

after a nuclear war?

The amount of time you need to stay in there

depends on how radioactive the fallout is.

Now a lot of people think of fallout shelters

like the game or show Fallout,

and they think we're gonna stay in there

for a hundred years or something like that.

That is not what they're built to do.

They are built to basically accommodate people

to maybe stay in there for at most two weeks,

maybe even less.

You might recognize these signs.

These are from the 1960s program

to identify places that could be used as fallout shelters.

A fallout shelter is not meant

to protect you from a nuclear weapon that drops on you.

What it's meant to do is be a place

that puts mass, so concrete or dirt ideally,

in between you and the outside world

so that if radioactive particles fall on top of you,

there is something in between you and them

to cut the amount of radiation.

So you can think of it when you go to the dentist

and they take an X-ray

and they put one of these heavy lead aprons on you.

It's sort of like a building equivalent of that lead apron.

Mac60five asks, How dangerous is Chernobyl Today?

There are people who visit Chernobyl

or did before the Ukraine-Russia war.

There are people who work at Chernobyl still today,

and they have means of checking

how much radiation they pick up.

There are tools called dosimeters.

This is one from the Cold War.

It basically tracks how much radiation you get.

This one works by looking through it at a light

and a little wire moves as it absorbs radiation.

And the workers on these kinds of places

are making sure that the amount of radiation they pick up

is within what we consider to be the safe amounts.

You probably wouldn't wanna live in Chernobyl though.

There are some people who have been living there,

people who used to live there

that eventually went back and they've said,

You know what? I just wanna live in my own home.

I don't care if it's contaminated.

Are they at risk?

Well, a little.

But if they're 70 years old and living at Chernobyl

increases their cancer risk by say 5%,

they're probably gonna die of something else anyway

because it takes a long time

for those kinds of cancers to develop.

If we talk about, what if 10,000 people lived there

and the cancer risk goes up by 5%,

you're gonna start seeing that

as 5% more cancers in this community than you would already.

austinsburner asks, How tf does radiation work?

How does a place be radioactive?

How does someone die from radiation poisoning?

You can think of it as little particles.

That's basically what the word radiation means.

It means little things spitting out.

And there's lots of different kinds of radiation.

The kind that people are usually talking about

is called ionizing radiation, and that means radiation

of types and energies that are capable

of knocking electrons off of other atoms and molecules.

The problem is that if you're made out of cells,

and especially if you have DNA,

ionizing things, that changes their chemistry.

And if you were a rock, who would care?

But if you're a biological system,

that means you're like shooting little bullets into cells

which can kill them, which is fine.

You have a lot of cells.

Or it can, in some rare cases,

change the DNA in a way that turns it into a cancerous cell.

Radiation poisoning is when you get so much radiation

that the number of cells you're killing

becomes actually significant.

So radioactive contamination is when a place

has radioactive stuff that is sending out the radiation.

So I have a Geiger counter here.

A Geiger counter is a tool for detecting radioactivity.

So what it has in it is a sensor that can tell

when a radioactive particle has gone across it.

And whenever it does this,

you're hearing this little click happening.

Why does it click?

Because we hooked it to a speaker

and we wanna be able to hear it.

Now I could have a radioactive substance.

This is trinitite, the glass from the first nuclear test.

This is something that contains trace amounts

of plutonium and uranium

and long-lived fission products.

And if I put the sensor over it,

[Geiger counter clicks]

you can hear that the clicking increases by a bit.

The air right above this radioactive material

is getting about twice as much radioactivity

as the normal air around here.

That's not that much.

If this was something actually dangerous,

it would be getting a lot more, a hundred times more.

But this is the sort of tool

that lets you measure when these radioactive particles

are being emitted from this radioactive substance.

GlitteringWeakness88 on Reddit asks,

What is the theoretical upper power limit

of a nuke we can produce currently?

If you wanted to,

you can make essentially an unlimited power nuclear weapon.

A thermonuclear weapon basically works

by having one nuclear weapon act

as sort of the detonator for another nuclear weapon.

And if you wanted to, you could make

that weapon be the detonator for another nuclear weapon.

And that detonator for another nuclear weapon.

The largest nuclear weapon ever made

was the Soviet Tsar Bomba.

It was tested in 1961 as a 50-megaton-sized weapon,

so 50 million tons of TNT,

and that was at half its power.

It was deliberately scaled back by half

to prevent contamination.

By comparison, the Hiroshima bomb

is 15,000 tons of TNT.

So this is a weapon thousands of times more powerful

than the first atomic bombs.

The United States could have done that.

They actually looked into doing

that kind of thing in the Cold War and decided not to.

So the largest weapon that I know of

that was ever taken seriously

by weapon scientists in the United States

was called the Sundial.

It was never built.

They didn't get that far in researching it.

But it was a weapon that was 10,000 megatons of TNT.

Why did the United States not do this?

Why did even the Soviet Union not really do this?

The Tsar Bomba was sort of a stunt

more than a practical weapon.

The answer is, one, you don't get that much from it.

Because of the way nuclear weapons work,

because they're basically a sphere expanding in the air.

Think of it as a balloon that you're like pumping air into.

What we care about for the damage

is the amount of the balloon that's gonna touch the ground.

A lot of that balloon is not gonna touch the ground.

And as we're putting energy into it,

the part that's touching the ground,

it's not increasing as a linear function.

It's increasing as what's called a cubic root.

The takeaway is,

if we wanted to double the damage of a weapon,

we typically have to increase the size of the weapon

by around eight times.

The real killer though is, to make them bigger,

we do more or less have to linearly increase the weight

and size of the weapon.

So the Tsar Bomba is a powerful weapon,

but it's the size of a school bus.

That weapon could not fit inside

the airplane that carried it

and had to sort of sit underneath it like a big egg.

If you are another country

and you see a plane coming towards you

with a big egg attached to it,

you're gonna really work hard to shoot that down.

That is not convenient.

If you're talking about weapons

that are the size of the Sundial, 10,000 megatons,

that's a weapon that's probably

the size of the space shuttle.

That's not easy to use. That's not easy to deploy.

That's gonna be also really expensive as an aside.

Trends in nuclear weapons design didn't go in that area.

What they did was they went for more compact weapons

so you can put 10 of them onto one missile

and then target 10 targets with one missile.

It's a weapon the size of a large trash can,

but it's 30 times more explosive than Hiroshima.

That's peak weapons design, not just more bang.

Perfect-Football2616 on Reddit asks,

Did the tactic of duck and cover

provide any protection from an actual nuclear strike?

Duck and Cover was a public education program

put out by the United States government,

and it was particularly aimed at school children.

And you'll see pictures

of children hiding under their desk from this period.

There was a short film created

with a turtle cartoon mascot, Bert the Turtle,

trying to talk to students about nuclear war.

And, of course, a lot of it looks pretty sketchy.

There are lots of people who lived through this who said,

That was the moment I realized

adults did not know what they were doing

if they thought this desk

was gonna protect me from an atomic bomb.

They are not saying

that if an atomic bomb lands on your school,

your desk is gonna keep you safe.

What they are doing with this policy

is saying there's gonna be an area where the bomb goes off,

where you just have no hope.

I'm sorry.

They don't say this in the movie

because it's aimed at children.

They don't even say this things aimed at adults

because the United States government

has a very hard time admitting

that people are gonna die in large numbers

if nuclear weapons go off,

even though it is self evidently true.

There's also a zone much further out

where you're far enough away that you'll say,

What was that? Oh my gosh, what's going on?

You are not going to be affected by the weapon, right?

You're gonna learn from the news.

So in between is a pretty small zone

where you have a chance of surviving

if you do the right thing.

Duck and Cover is for that zone,

and it's for an area where the blast pressure

is going to be enough

that it is gonna be sort of like an earthquake.

They're worried about the ceiling collapsing,

they're worried about windows breaking.

They're worried that if you have exposed skin,

you might get burned.

And so the tactic is get down,

cover up your most vulnerable parts,

and you can increase your chance of survival

a little bit that way.

TheMuteNewt on Reddit, great name,

How close did Nazi Germany actually get

to developing an atomic weapon?

Nazi Germany did not get close

to making an atomic bomb.

At the end of World War II they were almost to the place

that the United States was in 1942.

So they almost had a prototype nuclear reactor,

not an atomic bomb.

Why not? Because they weren't trying to make an atomic bomb.

I know that's a hot take

because we like to talk about the race for the atomic bomb.

The Americans feared they were working on atomic bomb,

but the Germans had actually decided they were gonna have

a pretty small research program for nuclear reactors,

maybe in the future, making atomic bombs.

But they concluded in 1942

that it would take a lot of work

from a lot of their scientists

to try and make an atomic bomb

that could be useful for World War II.

And in 1942, they thought they were gonna win the war

so they didn't think they needed an atomic bomb.

They thought that making an atomic bomb

would be very hard and they were correct on that.

And as a result, they thought nobody else

was gonna make one either.

So this is a problem for after the war.

Well, that's it. That's all the questions.

I hope you learned something.

I hope you don't make an atomic bomb.

Until next time. [upbeat music]",,Condé Nast,"bomb, gonna, questions, united, dont, historian, weapon, atomic, weapons, nuclear, war, sort, answers, lot",pending,2025-08-15T23:53:57.290595+00:00,fadc8dcfb5a1eb4130eb3f13f18789c94855edd4acc0bfb7160ac85a4f37fdb6

I like the simple nature of Salesforce plans, with one option for small and midsize businesses and another for enterprises, priced at $25 and $100 per user per month, respectively. Who should look elsewhere: Many Salesforce Starter CRM customers are impressed with the services offered, though some note the high price for enterprise users. Some features, including advanced automation and access to AppExchange -- the Salesforce app marketplace -- are limited to premium subscribers. There also isn't a middle ground plan between the Starter and Pro Suites, and this might deter some people. Microsoft Dynamics CRM could be a great alternative.

Why we like it: HubSpot is a great way to learn how CRM software can benefit your business. You can take advantage of the HubSpot free plan, which requires only an email address sign-up and a short verification process. While testing out this CRM, I found the walk-through and guides to different parts of the platform very useful. If you're unsure how to use a CRM platform, HubSpot will point you in the right direction, and its tutorials will help you learn about each section without too much stress. You can use HubSpot for a variety of tasks, such as organizing and managing marketing, customer contact records, website development, and customer support, among many other use cases. Paid plans begin at $15 per seat per month for starter plans, which I consider affordable and a good value for the money. However, subscriptions to advanced plans quickly escalate in price. Recently, HubSpot launched a deep research connector with ChatGPT for business predictions and analytics, alongside a connector for Anthropic's Claude, a chatbot AI assistant. Who it's for: This is a fair solution with a free tier if you're new to the CRM world, with many smaller outfits reporting that they're happy with the system. However, some also note that the costs can quickly escalate if you want advanced features. Who should look elsewhere: Though you'll find that the basic, free CRM can be used for tasks such as contact management and email marketing, some things are limited to paid plans, including features like automation, sales lead generation, and helpdesk functions, as well as some reporting options. So, if you later feel like you need these options, you'll either need to upgrade or look elsewhere.

What are the major types of CRM software? Though the overall classifications of different types of CRM software vary from vendor to vendor, the same themes appear. You may want to research the major types of CRM before you make a purchase decision, as that may influence how your business grows. Operational: Most modern CRM platforms offer some kind of operational mechanism or module. Operational CRMs tend to focus on optimizing business operations, including sales processes, logistics, and customer communications. Operational CRMs may be particularly useful for startups and small and midsize businesses looking to scale. Analytical/data-driven: Other CRMs focus on the intrinsic value of data. Businesses able to handle, securely store, and analyze customer data -- always useful if held in a centralized, organized platform -- can draw insights and see patterns that may influence their future sales activities or reveal new revenue streams. Furthermore, data-driven CRMs may reveal ways to improve customer relationships and retention. Collaborative: Collaborative CRMs provide organizations with a way to enhance collaboration and productivity. CRM suites can be used to create department channels and data repositories, allowing different teams to work together and to share information. For instance, a sales team could collaborate with marketing and finance to create new customer promotions and campaigns. Customer service teams, too, can access important records to track customer journeys and resolve issues. Show more

How to integrate CRM software into your business efficiently Every business has unique CRM requirements, and the solution you select will depend on the needs of your organization. Below are some basic recommendations for integrating your new CRM software effectively: Plan and assess: Research and assess the needs of your business and whether the CRM solution you're considering will provide a return on your investment. Consider the type of CRM you need, your primary reason for using a CRM, how many seats you'll need, and whether you need collaborative functions to integrate the CRM with different departments, such as marketing or customer service.

Consider the type of CRM you need, your primary reason for using a CRM, how many seats you'll need, and whether you need collaborative functions to integrate the CRM with different departments, such as marketing or customer service. Existing systems: Consider whether there are existing, legacy systems that the CRM will replace. If there are apps you want the CRM to integrate with, you may also need to check compatibility requirements and support. It may also be important to create new policies, especially around data and security.

It may also be important to create new policies, especially around data and security. Integrations and downtime: There are various tactics you can use for integrating a new CRM with existing systems, apps, and data silos. Though quick-and-dirty code changes and bridges are an option, as well as standalone CRM integration software, we recommend that you also explore the use of robust APIs that won't cause interoperability issues down the line.

You can instantly sign up for its free plan and build your first campaign. With step-by-step buttons on its dashboard, like importing or creating your contact list, connecting an integration, and importing your brand persona, your first round of emails or SMS campaign will be ready in no time.

Here, you can either start from scratch or use a campaign template. The drag-and-drop editor makes the entire setup process easy, though the free templates are pretty barebones unless you upgrade. The automation builder can trigger emails based on sign-ups, tags, events, or custom criteria you set. I tested both prebuilt and custom journeys, and while it takes a few minutes to learn the flow, it's flexible and powerful once you do. That said, Classic Automations were discontinued in mid-2025 by Mailchimp, so if you're coming back to the platform after a while, expect to rebuild from scratch and pay for something that used to be free.

Moreover, Mailchimp's dashboard actually recommends flows based on common goals like welcoming new contacts, sharing content with Meta leads, or sending birthday discounts. These flows save serious time for basic tasks like recovering abandoned carts or nurturing repeat buyers. The thing is, on the Free plan, you can preview them, but you'll need to upgrade to actually launch them. Still, it's nice to see what's possible before committing. Setting up a flow is visual, i.e., more drag-and-drop than techy, which makes it approachable, even if you've never done automation before. Once you understand how triggers and actions work together, you can build out surprisingly complex sequences.

Plans start free with 500 contacts, then scale based on list size. Paid plans include Essentials (from $13 per month), Standard (from $20 per month), and Premium (from $350 per month for 10,000+ contacts). So, if you're working with a small list, the Free or Essentials plan might be enough. You can also buy credits with a Pay As You Go plan if you send your emails occasionally. Free trials run for 14 days on Standard or Essentials, and nonprofits get a 15% discount.

If you've heard about Alexa+, a revamped version of Amazon's virtual assistant powered by generative AI, you may be interested in diving into the Amazon Alexa ecosystem. Amazon Echo speakers are the best way to bring Alexa into your smart home. The Echo Pop and Echo Dot, Amazon's two most compact smart speakers, are the most popular and affordable Echo devices available.

Amazon's new Alexa+ is launching gradually over the next few weeks. While the company is prioritizing the larger Echo Shows in the initial release, Amazon says that after you get access to Alexa+ on an Echo Show 8,10,15, or 21, it will be available on all of your Echo devices, with the exception of some older generations.

Also: Amazon just gave Alexa its biggest upgrade in a decade - and old Echo devices will support it

The Echo Pop is newer than the Echo Dot and is marketed as the company's most compact speaker. At about two-thirds of the size of the already compact Echo Dot, the Echo Pop is best suited for small rooms and can be tucked away in the corner of a desk. The slightly larger Echo Dot is about the size of an Apple HomePod mini and delivers more potent sound.

Read on to learn more about how the Echo Pop and Echo Dot compare and which is best suited for which sort of user.

You should buy the Echo Pop if...



Here's an Amazon Echo Pop next to an Apple Magic Mouse, for reference. Maria Diaz/ZDNET

1. You need a compact speaker

The Echo Pop is Amazon's smallest and most affordable smart speaker, perfect for a small room -- such as a dorm or a kid's room. Because it doesn't feature a screen and can go unnoticed, it's a simple way to introduce yourself to the Alexa ecosystem or give someone access to Amazon's voice assistant in a simple, unintimidating way.

Review: Amazon Echo Pop review: A portable smart speaker for small spaces

The Echo Pop is a perfect option if you're looking for a compact speaker for your kid's desk, a guest room, or an area you don't use often. It can be unreliable in larger rooms or when tasked with bigger assignments, which brings me to my next point.

2. You plan on everyday music streaming, podcasts, or audiobooks

The Echo Pop is surprisingly loud, but the sound quality decreases greatly when the volume increases. This is why the Echo Pop is meant for smaller rooms and is much less expensive than other Echo devices.

Also: The best smart home devices

The Echo Pop won't be the life of the party at a backyard barbecue. Still, it's excellent for listening to music informally when hanging out in your room, catching up on your favorite podcasts, and listening to audiobooks. Having Alexa built-in makes it more enticing, as you can use the AI-powered voice assistant to control smart devices around your home.

1. You need Alexa to be more reliable

Because the Echo Pop is a smaller, more affordable smart speaker than the Echo Dot, it's also less reliable. The Echo Dot is more responsive and can easily hear me from across the room, whether it's playing music or not.

The Echo Pop, in turn, appears to have a simpler microphone array that is easily overpowered by high volumes. I've often found Alexa unable to hear me on the Echo Pop when the volume is too high, which can be frustrating, especially because it doesn't have an action button.

The Echo Dot features a volume-up button, a volume-down button, a mute button, and an action button. The last one is a great way to wake Alexa without talking to it, which would be nice in the Echo Pop when it can't hear me. I've resorted to unplugging the Echo Pop when it can't hear me, so it stops blasting ""The Wheels on the Bus.""

2. You want room-filling sound

The Echo Dot isn't a high-end speaker, but it is great for most users. It can deliver room-filling sound from a small package, as the audio doesn't deteriorate as much as the Echo Pop's when the volume goes up. For example, you can pair two Echo Dots to function as external speakers for a TV and get stereo sound better than audio from most inexpensive TVs.

Also: Not all Echo devices will get Alexa Plus - see if yours made the list

As a device often discounted during Prime Day and holiday sales events for around half off, I'd recommend the Echo Dot to most users looking for a reliable smart speaker with Alexa built-in that can deliver sound from all directions.

Considering buying an Oura Ring to track your sleep, activity, or stress? Oura is taking up to $200 off its third-gen smart ring, depending on the finish and size. This deal applies to the Oura Ring Heritage and Oura Ring Horizon, two third-generation smart rings.

Also: The Oura Ring 4 is ZDNET's best product of the year

The deal on the earlier generation Oura Ring 3 is so low because Oura recently unveiled the Oura Ring 4. The Oura Ring 4 is an impressive and well-designed smart ring that blows its competitors (and even the Ring 3) out of the water. But does that mean you should buy the newer Ring 4 over the less expensive Ring 3 that's on sale right now? It all depends on what features you prioritize in a smart ring. I break down the differences below.

1. You prioritize comfort

One of the highlights of the new Oura Ring 4 is its smart sensors. Oura Ring 4's smart sensing technology uses 18 signal pathways, compared to the Oura Ring 3's eight, to capture more accurate data with fewer gaps.

So, what does that have to do with comfort? These smart sensors allow the raised sensor domes that stick out on the Oura Ring 3's interior to flatten and recede on the Oura Ring 4 for a more comfortable and less constrictive wear. I wore the Oura Ring 3 for around eight months, and one of the few gripes I had with it was that the three domes would cling to the inside of my finger, resulting in dents that remained on my skin for days after.

Also: I tested the Oura Ring 4 for weeks. Here's why it's the best health tracker right now

The Oura Ring 4 is far more comfortable than the Oura Ring 3 thanks to the receded smart sensing technology. It's noticeably slimmer, both on the interior of the ring and the exterior, which results in a lighter feel. If you are more sensitive to health trackers around your wrist or finger and get easily annoyed with jewelry, I'd suggest the Oura Ring 4.

2. You want a smaller or larger ring size

Expanded sizing is one of the major hardware upgrades that came with the Oura Ring 4. Where the Oura Ring 3 offers sizes six through 13, the Oura Ring 4 offers sizes four through 15. That's four more sizes on the larger and smaller ends of the spectrum. If you couldn't buy the Oura Ring 3 because the available sizes didn't fit your finger, the Oura Ring 4 might fit you better.

3. You want a longer battery life

The Oura Ring 3 boasts a battery life of up to seven days, though I normally got around four. The newer Oura Ring 4 boasts a battery life of up to eight days, but during my testing I got around 5 and a half.

If you forget to charge your tech constantly and want a smart ring that you can put on for a few days and not worry about, then I'd recommend the Oura Ring 4. If you are adamant about daily charging, however, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3.

1. You just want the newest software

Most of the software updates that came to the Oura Ring 4 also are available on the Oura Ring 3. That includes automatic heart rate monitoring during workouts, the Oura app redesign, upgraded daytime stress features that help contextualize your physiological stress, and many new Oura Labs features you can test out, like meal logging.

Automatic heart rate monitoring continues Oura's mission of autonomously logging health data with little assistance from the ring wearer. This means that, on top of the automatic workout detection feature, the Oura Ring now can monitor and record your heart rate during these activities without you clicking on the Record workout HR button.

Also: I tested the Oura Ring 3 -- and it totally beat my Apple Watch

Oura upgraded its daytime stress feature by implementing the daily tags people use to document their meals, workouts, illnesses, and moods onto the daytime stress timeline. Let's say you just had an argument with a coworker and find that your heart rate is elevated. If you log that in the app, it will include that tag into the daytime stress timeline.

Lastly, there are a few experimental features Oura Ring 3 users can take advantage of through Oura Labs, which is also available on both rings. One of my favorite features I tested was the meal-logging feature that uses your camera and AI to document what you're eating (and when).

The AI was able to detect that I was eating yogurt with berries and bananas one morning, despite the yogurt being fully picked over and mixed with the other ingredients.

2. You don't want to spend more money

You can buy an Oura Ring 3 for up to $200 right now. The third-generation smart ring has been on sale since Oura unveiled a newer generation. If a starting price of $350 (plus that $6 monthly subscription to access all your data) is a little too much for you, the Oura Ring 3 is substantially cheaper.

3. Comfort isn't a concern

If you own an Oura Ring 3 and aren't disturbed by the raised sensors or the chunkier build, I don't see a need for you to upgrade to the Oura Ring 4. If you don't own either ring and are trying to make a buying decision, I'd recommend the Oura Ring 3 if you are unbothered by a tight and raised dome around your finger.
